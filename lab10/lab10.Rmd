# Initialize a temporary in memory database
con <- dbConnect(SQLite(), ":memory:")

# Download tables
actor <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/actor.csv")
rental <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/rental.csv")

dbWriteTable(con, "rental", rental)
dbWriteTable(con, "customer", customer)
dbWriteTable(con, "payment", payment)

```
## Exercise 1
Retrive the actor ID, first name and last name for all actors using the actor table. Sort by last name and then by first name.
```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor
ORDER by last_name, first_name
LIMIT 15
```
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor
ORDER by last_name, first_name
LIMIT 15
")
```
## Exercise 2
Retrive the actor ID, first name, and last name for actors whose last name equals ‘WILLIAMS’ or ‘DAVIS’.
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor 
WHERE last_name IN ('WILLIAMS', 'DAVIS')
ORDER BY last_name
")
```
## Exercise 3
Write a query against the rental table that returns the IDs of the customers who rented a film on July 5, 2005 (use the rental.rental_date column, and you can use the date() function to ignore the time component). Include a single row for each distinct customer ID.
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
           PRAGMA table_info(rental)
           "
)
```
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, rental_date
FROM rental
WHERE date(rental_date) = '2005-07-05'
")
```
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id,
COUNT (*) AS N
FROM rental
WHERE date(rental_date) = '2005-07-05'
GROUP BY customer_id
")
```
## Exercise 4.1
Construct a query that retrives all rows from the payment table where the amount is either 1.99, 7.99, 9.99.
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
           PRAGMA table_info(payment)
           "
)
```
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount IN (1.99, 7.99, 9.99)
LIMIT 15
")
```
## Exercise 4.2
Construct a query that retrives all rows from the payment table where the amount is greater then 5
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount >5
LIMIT 15
")
```

## Exercise 4.3
Construct a query that retrives all rows from the payment table where the amount is greater then 5 and less then 8
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount >5 AND amount <8
LIMIT 15
")
```

## Exercise 5
Retrive all the payment IDs and their amount from the customers whose last name is ‘DAVIS’.
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
           PRAGMA table_info(customer)
           "
)
```
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT c.customer_id, c.last_name, p.payment_id, p.amount
FROM customer AS c INNER JOIN payment AS p
  ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
  WHERE c.last_name IN ('DAVIS')
/* WHERE c.last_name == 'DAVIS' */  /* This is a comment */
")
```

## Exercise 6.2
Use COUNT(*) and GROUP BY to count the number of rentals for each customer_id
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id
LIMIT 15
")
```

## Exercise 6.3
Repeat the previous query and sort by the count in descending order
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 15
")
```

## Exercise 6.4
Repeat the previous query but use HAVING to only keep the groups with 40 or more.
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM rental
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING count >=40
ORDER BY count DESC
")
```

## Exercise 7.1
Modify the above query to do those calculations for each customer_id
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT customer_id,
       MAX(amount) AS maxpayment,
       MIN(amount) AS minpayment,
       AVG(amount) AS avgpayment,
       SUM(amount) AS sumpayment
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
LIMIT 15
")
```

## Exercise 7.2
Modify the above query to only keep the customer_ids that have more then 5 payments


* Run the following chunk to disconnect from the connection.
```{r}
# clean up
#dbDisconnect(con)
dbGetQuery(con,"
SELECT customer_id,
       COUNT (*)  AS N,
       MAX(amount) AS maxpayment,
       MIN(amount) AS minpayment,
       AVG(amount) AS avgpayment,
       SUM(amount) AS sumpayment
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING N >5
")
```
 ## Clean up
Run the following chunk to disconnect from the connection.
```{r}
dbDisconnect(con)
```
