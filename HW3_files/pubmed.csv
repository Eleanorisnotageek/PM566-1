"Background and aims: Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have underlying cardiovascular (CV) disease or develop acute cardiac injury during the course of the illness. Adequate understanding of the interplay between COVID-19 and CV disease is required for optimum management of these patients. Methods: A literature search was done using PubMed and Google search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic. Results: Respiratory illness is the dominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19; CV involvement occurs much less commonly. Acute cardiac injury, defined as significant elevation of cardiac troponins, is the most commonly reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19. It occurs in approximately 8-12% of all patients. Direct myocardial injury due to viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effect of systemic inflammation appear to be the most common mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury. The information about other CV manifestations in COVID-19 is very limited at present. Nonetheless, it has been consistently shown that the presence of pre-existing CV disease and/or development of acute cardiac injury are associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients. Conclusions: Most of the current reports on COVID-19 have only briefly described CV manifestations in these patients. Given the enormous burden posed by this illness and the significant adverse prognostic impact of cardiac involvement, further research is required to understand the incidence, mechanisms, clinical presentation and outcomes of various CV manifestations in COVID-19 patients.",covid
"Introduction: Contradictory data have been reported on the incidence of stroke in patients with COVID-19 and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with history of stroke. Methods: This study systematically reviews case series reporting stroke as a complication of COVID-19, and analyses the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 and history of stroke. The pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke in patients with COVID-19 are also reviewed. Conclusions: History of stroke increases the risk of death due to COVID-19 by 3 times. Stroke currently seems not to be one of the main complications of COVID-19.",covid
"This article aims at collecting all information needed for dentists regarding the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world by reviewing articles published by now. In late 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of uncertain etiology happened in Wuhan, China. There were many reports related to a live-animal and seafood market, supporting that the pathogens were transferred from animals to humans, rapidly evolving into transmission from human to human. The pathogen was classified as 2019 Novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV), and the disease was named COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given that COVID-19 has lately been detected in infected patients' saliva, the COVID-19 outbreak is an alert that all dental and other health professionals must be vigilant in defending against the infectious disease spread, and it may enable to assess whether non-invasive saliva diagnostic for COVID-19. There has so far been no evidence from randomized controlled trials to prescribe any particular anti-nCoV treatment or vaccine, and COVID-19 management has been widely supportive. Since the ACE-2 was expressing on oral cavity mucosa, there is a potentially huge COVID-19 infectious vulnerability risk for oral cavity and brought up a proof for the future prevention procedure in dental practice and daily life. As a result, the whole dental teams should be vigilant and keep patients and themselves in a safe environment by following the guideline in this study.",covid
"OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. The CT features of COVID-19 are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to familiarize radiologists with possible CT patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This study included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with adenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years). We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients. The CT images included images from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies. We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly diagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19. The The ""reversed halo"" sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign are uncommon CT features. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of adenovirus infection. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. CONCLUSION. We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful as a standard method for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients. However, CT is still limited for identifying specific viruses and distinguishing between viruses.",covid
"Background: Much of the focus regarding the global pandemic of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has been on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hematologic complications. However, neurologic complications have arisen as an increasingly recognized area of morbidity and mortality. Objective: This brief report summarizes the neurologic complications associated with COVID-19 with an emphasis on the emergency medicine clinician. Discussion: COVID-19 has infected over 3.5 million people and killed over 240,000 people worldwide. While pulmonary complications are profound, the neurologic system is also significantly impacted, with complications including acute cerebrovascular events, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Additionally, patients on immunosuppressive medications for pre-existing neurologic issues are at an increased risk for complications with COVID-19 infection, and many of the currently proposed COVID-19 therapies can interact with these medications. Conclusions: When caring for COVID-19 patients, emergency medicine clinicians should be aware of the neurologic complications from COVID-19.",covid
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning that, although the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from Wuhan City (China), is not pandemic, it should be contained to prevent the global spread. The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARS-CoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense. This mini-review aims at investigating the most recent trend of COVID-19.",covid
"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread all around the world in a very short period of time. Recent data are showing significant prevalence of arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among patients with COVID-19, which raised many questions about higher susceptibility of patients with these comorbidities to the novel coronavirus, as well as the role of hypertension and CVD in progression and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. There is a very limited amount of data, usually obtained from a small population, regarding the effect of the underlying disease on the outcome in patients with COVID-19. The evaluation of the treatment of these comorbidities at baseline and during COVID-19 is scarce and the results are conflicting. Hypertension and CVD, after the adjustment for other clinical and demographic parameters, primarily age, did not remain independent predictors of the lethal outcome in COVID-19 patients. Some investigations speculated about the association between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID-19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients. Withdrawing or switching RAAS inhibitors would have uncertain benefits, but it would definitely have many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac function deterioration and renal function impairment, which could potentially induce more complications in patients with COVID-19 than the infection of coronavirus itself. The aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and CVD in patients with COVID-19, their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and CVD in COVID-19 patients.",covid
"Objective: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also called COVID-19, has caused a pandemic which has swiftly involved the entire world and raised great public health concerns. The scientific community is actively exploring treatments that would potentially be effective in combating COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine has been demonstrated to limit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro. In malarial pandemic countries, chloroquine is widely used to treat malaria. In malarial non-pandemic nations, chloroquine is not widely used. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action. The aim of this study was to indirectly investigate the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 by determining the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic nations. We sought evidence to support or refute the hypothesis that these drugs could show efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. Materials and methods: We reviewed in vitro studies, in vivo studies, original studies, clinical trials, and consensus reports, that were conducted to evaluate the antiviral activities of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The studies on ""COVID-19 and its allied treatment were found from World Health Organization (WHO), ISI-Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries. The search was based on keywords: antiviral drugs, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, COVID-19, COVID-19 treatment modalities, and coronavirus. In addition, we analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in malaria pandemic and non-pandemic countries. The review and analyses were performed on March 28, 2020. Results: For this study, we identified a total of 09 published articles: 03 clinical trials with sample size 150; 03 in vitro studies and 03 expert consensus reports. These studies were all suggestive that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can successfully treat COVID-19 infections. We found that COVID-19 infections are highly pandemic in countries where malaria is least pandemic and are least pandemic in nations where malaria is highly pandemic. Conclusions: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have antiviral characteristics in vitro. The findings support the hypothesis that these drugs have efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. People are currently using these drugs for malaria. It is reasonable, given the hypothetical benefit of these two drugs, that they are now being tested in clinical trials to assess their effectiveness to combat this global health crisis.",covid
"COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization and is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, and common clinical symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, and fatigue. Myocardial injury is relatively common in patients with COVID-19, accounting for 7%-23% of cases, and is associated with a higher rate of morbidity and mortality. There is a discrepancy in the literature about myocarditis as the etiology of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19; although many anecdotal reports of myocarditis have been noted, there are only a handful of case reports in the literature about myocarditis related to COVID-19. In this review we summarize the most up to date literature around the association between COVID-19 and myocarditis and provide clinicians a practical framework about the clinical manifestations, diagnostic tools, and treatment options currently available. Importantly, this review will heighten suspicion for myocarditis as an etiology of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients, therefore improving clinical outcomes and encouraging shared clinical decision-making. This will also open the door for further research to build around this review. Emergent treatment options for COVID-19 are in clinical trials and might be of benefit to COVID-19 patients with myocarditis in addition to current guideline-based recommendations.",covid
"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease with lack of established laboratory markers available to evaluate illness severity. In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. Methods: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. Results: Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31 × 109/L; 95% CI, from -35 to -29 × 109/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival, found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -48 × 109/L; 95% CI, -57 to -39 × 109/L. In the four studies (n = 1427) which reported data on rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.6). Conclusions: Low platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of worsening illness during hospitalization.",covid
"Currently, the number of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased rapidly, but relationship between comorbidity and patients with COVID-19 still not clear. The aim was to explore whether the presence of common comorbidities increases COVID-19 patients' risk. A literature search was performed using the electronic platforms (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases) to obtain relevant research studies published up to March 1, 2020. Relevant data of research endpoints in each study were extracted and merged. All data analysis was performed using Stata12.0 software. A total of 1558 patients with COVID-19 in 6 studies were enrolled in our meta-analysis eventually. Hypertension (OR: 2.29, P<0.001), diabetes (OR: 2.47, P<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR: 5.97, P<0.001), cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.93, P<0.001), and cerebrovascular disease (OR:3.89, P=0.002)were independent risk factors associated with COVID-19 patients. The meta-analysis revealed no correlation between increased risk of COVID-19 and liver disease, malignancy, or renal disease. Hypertension, diabetes, COPD, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease are major risk factors for patients with COVID-19. Knowledge of these risk factors can be a resource for clinicians in the early appropriate medical management of patients with COVID-19.",covid
"A new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The SARS-CoV-2 spread very rapidly, causing a global pandemic, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Older adults have higher peak of viral load and, especially those with comorbidities, had higher COVID-19-related fatality rates than younger adults. In this Perspective paper, we summarize current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and aging, in order to understand why older people are more affected by COVID-19. We discuss about the possibility that the so-called ""immunosenescence"" and ""inflammaging"" processes, already present in a fraction of frail older adults, could allow the immune escape of SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 serious complications. Finally, we propose to use geroscience approaches to the field of COVID-19.",covid
"Background and aims: Diabetes mellitus is associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 contributes to worsening of dysglycemia in people with diabetes mellitus over and above that contributed by stress hyperglycemia. Herein, we have reviewed the two-way interactions between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus. Methods: We have performed an extensive literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till April 25, 2020, with the following keywords: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""diabetes"", ""diabetes mellitus"", ""SARS"", ""infection"" and ""management of diabetes mellitus"" with interposition of the Boolean operator ""AND"". Results: Compromised innate immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu, reduced expression of ACE2 and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in people with diabetes mellitus contribute to poor prognosis in COVID-19. On the contrary, direct β-cell damage, cytokine-induced insulin resistance, hypokalemia and drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (like corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir) can contribute to worsening of glucose control in people with diabetes mellitus. Conclusions: The two-way interaction between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus sets up a vicious cycle wherein COVID-19 leads to worsening of dysglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in turn, exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Thus, it is imperative that people with diabetes mellitus take all necessary precautions and ensure good glycemic control amid the ongoing pandemic.",covid
"Eosinophils are circulating and tissue-resident leukocytes that have potent proinflammatory effects in a number of diseases. Recently, eosinophils have been shown to have various other functions, including immunoregulation and antiviral activity. Eosinophil levels vary dramatically in a number of clinical settings, especially following eosinophil-targeted therapy, which is now available to selectively deplete these cells. There are key coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related questions concerning eosinophils whose answers affect recommended prevention and care. First, do patients with eosinophilia-associated diseases have an altered course of COVID-19? Second, do patients with eosinopenia (now intentionally induced by biological drugs) have unique COVID-19 susceptibility and/or disease course? This is a particularly relevant question because eosinopenia is associated with acute respiratory deterioration during infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Third, do eosinophils contribute to the lung pathology induced during COVID-19 and will they contribute to immunopotentiation potentially associated with emerging COVID-19 vaccines? Herein, we address these timely questions and project considerations during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Purpose: Otorhinolaryngological manifestations are common symptoms of COVID-19. This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment. The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice. Methods: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"" in conjunction with ""otorhinolaryngological manifestation"", ""ENT"", and ""olfaction"". Results: The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present. COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT. ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19. During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases. An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals. Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed. Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.",covid
"Background: COVID-19 pneumonia is a newly recognized illness that is spreading rapidly around the world and causes many disability and deaths. Some diseases, for instance diabetes, is continuously suggested as a risk factor which contributes to the severity and mortality of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no comprehensive studies aiming to explain the exact relationship between diabetes and COVID-19. Thus, this study aims to summarize the evidence about diabetes and COVID-19 outbreak through a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. Method: A literature review was implemented within databases of Scopus, PubMed, Science direct, and Web of science. Observational reviews, case-report, and case-series studies that assessed the diabetes in COVID-19 patients, were included. Data extraction and assessment were guided by PRISMA checklist. Findings: Some studies suggest that there were no significant differences in symptoms between patients who suffered from both diabetes and COVID-19 and those who only suffered COVID-19. In the subsequent meta-analysis 14.5% of the subjects were diabetic patient. These clients have poor ARDS prognosis, severe symptoms, and the death rate is higher among COVID-19 patients. In addition, it is suggested the diabetic patients will be treated with antibiotics, antivirals, and HCQ. Conclusion: The results of this study show that diabetes is a risk factor - and contributes to the severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. This paper also provides recommendations and guidelines for which could be useful for prevention and treatment of diabetic patients affected by COVID-19.",covid
"Background: A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has raised world concern since it emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The infection may result in severe pneumonia with clusters of illness onsets. Its impacts on public health make it paramount to clarify the clinical features with other pneumonias. Methods: Nineteen COVID-19 and 15 other patients with pneumonia (non-COVID-19) in areas outside of Hubei were involved in this study. Both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were confirmed to be infected using throat swabs and/or sputa with/without COVID-2019 by real-time RT-PCR. We analyzed the demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features from those patients, and compared the differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19. Results: All patients had a history of exposure to confirmed cases of COVID-19 or travel to Hubei before illness. The median (IQR) duration was 8 (6-11) and 5 (4-11) days from exposure to onset in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases, respectively. The clinical symptoms were similar between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough. Fifteen (78.95%) COVID-19 but 4 (26.67%) non-COVID-19 patients had bilateral involvement while 17 COVID-19 patients (89.47%) but 1 non-COVID-19 patient (6.67%) had multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest CT images. Compared with non-COVID-19, COVID-19 presents remarkably more abnormal laboratory tests, including AST, ALT, γ-GT, LDH, and α-HBDH. Conclusions: The COVID-19 infection has onsets similar to other pneumonias. CT scan may be a reliable test for screening COVID-19 cases. Liver function damage is more frequent in COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 patients. LDH and α-HBDH may be considerable markers for evaluation of COVID-19.",covid
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is far reaching, with devastating effects on individuals, communities, and societies across the world. People with chronic health conditions may be at greater risk of contracting or experiencing complications from COVID-19. In addition to illness or death for those who contract the virus, the physical distancing required to flatten the curve of new cases is having a negative impact on the economy, the effects of which intersect with mental health and other existing health concerns, thus affecting marginalized communities. Given that HIV also has a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, COVID-19 is affecting people with HIV (PWH) in unique ways and will continue to have an impact on HIV research and treatment after the COVID-19 crisis passes. Using the biopsychosocial framework to contextualize the impact of COVID-19 on PWH, the purpose of this review article is to: (1) outline the similarities and differences between the COVID-19 and HIV pandemics; (2) describe the current and future impact of COVID-19 on PWH; and (3) outline a call to action for scientists and practitioners to respond to the impact of COVID-19 on HIV prevention and treatment.",covid
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) that emerged in Wuhan, China, has rapidly spread to many countries across all six WHO regions. However, its pathobiology remains incompletely understood and many efforts are underway to study it worldwide. To clarify its pathogenesis to some extent, it will inevitably require lots of COVID-2019-associated pathological autopsies. Pathologists from all over the world have raised concerns with pathological autopsy relating to COVID-2019. The issue of whether a person died from COVID-2019 infection or not is always an ambiguous problem in some cases, and ongoing epidemiology from China may shed light on it. This review retrospectively summarizes the research status of pathological autopsy for COVID-2019 deaths in China, which will be important for the cause of death, prevention, control and clinical strategies of COVID-2019. Moreover, it points out several challenges at autopsy. We believe pathological studies from China enable to correlate clinical symptoms and pathological features of COVID-2019 for doctors and provide an insight into COVID-2019 disease.",covid
"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly pathogenic viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Currently, COVID-19 has caused global health concern. It is assumed that COVID-19 has zoonotic origin based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet market in Wuhan City, China. The phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has significant sequence similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, thus bats could be primary possible reservoir. The intermediate host and there subsequent transfer is not known yet, although human to human transfer is widely confirmed. The transmission of COVID-19 infection from one person to another resulted in the isolation of patients who were subsequently given a variety of treatments. To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc. No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is reported yet. However, in clinical trials, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID-19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery. In this article emergence and pathogenicity of COVID-19 infection along with potential therapeutic strategies are analyzed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Unprecedented measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China. People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%. The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P<0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019. Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for Chinese residents to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices. Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to populations of a low socioeconomic status.",covid
"Sars-CoV-2 virus infection (COVID-19) was observed in China in the last months of 2019. In the following period, this infection spread all over the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the existence of a pandemic. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate skin diseases associated with COVID-19 under three main headings: Skin problems related to personal protective equipment and personal hygiene measures, skin findings observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and finally skin findings due to COVID- 19 treatment agents. Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itch, pressure urticaria, exacerbation of pre-existing skin diseases and new skin lesion occurence / new skin disease occurence may be due to personal protective equipment. Skin problems related to personal hygiene measures could cause itch, dryness and contact dermatitis. Skin findings could also be observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The incidence of skin lesions because of COVID-19 was reported between 0.2% and 29%. Many skin lesions such as maculopapular, urticarial, vesicular, chilblain- like, thrombotic / ischemic etc. could be observed in COVID-19. Some authors state that the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection specific skin finding is absent. But, especially in asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic COVID-19 patients, skin lesions can lead to the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition skin lesions could occur due to COVID-19 treatment agents. As a result, many skin lesions could appear because of COVID-19. Even if there were no COVID-19 diagnosis, skin findings should be evaluated carrefully in this pandemic period. Key worlds: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, dermatology, skin findings.",covid
"The current pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an ongoing healthcare crisis. While COVID- 19 typically presents as fever and respiratory illness, almost 50% of the patients also have associated digestive symptoms which vary from abdominal pain to diarrhoea and indigestion. Literature review of association of COVID- 19 with digestive symptoms was done using Google search and the results are presented herein.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic has predominantly affected the adult population. The disease is less well-defined in children (≤18 years). This review summarises the current understanding of the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and management of COVID-19 in children and adolescents. The prevalence of COVID-19 is significantly lower in children than adults, but paediatric disease is likely underdiagnosed as a result of the high numbers of asymptomatic or mild cases. Children are vulnerable to family cluster outbreaks, but are unlikely to be index cases within a household. Vertical transmission or breast milk transmission are yet to be proven. Between 10 and 90% of paediatric COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic. Symptomatic cases typically present with mild symptoms, including cough, fever and sore throat. Intensive care admission and mortality are rare. Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 is a rare, but severe, newly emerging phenotype. At present, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 in adults or children; management is usually supportive. For severe or critical disease, including paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19, the decision to start antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy should be on a case-by-case basis; in the UK, this should be done within a clinical trial. Further research is needed into both the disease course and treatment of paediatric COVID-19.",covid
"Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in Wuhan, China. Meanwhile, the outbreak also drew attention and concern from the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 is another human infectious disease caused by coronavirus. The transmission of COVID-19 is potent and the infection rate is fast. Since there is no specific drug for COVID-19, the treatment is mainly symptomatic supportive therapy. In addition, it should be pointed out that patients with severe illness need more aggressive treatment and meticulous care. Recently, accurate RNA detection has been decisive for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The development of highly sensitive RT-PCR has facilitated epidemiological studies that provide insight into the prevalence, seasonality, clinical manifestations and course of COVID-19 infection. In this review, we summarize the epidemiology and characteristics of COVID-19.",covid
"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has aroused global health concerns, particularly in relation to diabetes where it has been associated with poorer outcomes. The bulk of the evolving evidence in diabetes and COVID-19 relates to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Since there are a significant number of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with unique concerns and challenges during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we reviewed existing literature, relevant websites, and related guidelines to form this narrative review to help address key questions in this area. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed database up to May 31, 2020, and retrieved all the articles published on T1D and COVID-19. Results: We found 18 relevant articles, each of which carried a part of the evidence regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 in patients with T1D, effect of COVID-19 on development of T1D, outcomes in T1D with COVID-19, and special management issues in T1D in the light of COVID-19. These have been documented in the present review. Conclusion: COVID-19 with T1D presents special challenges. While the available evidence does shed some light, we need more evidence to deal with this difficult duo.",covid
"Objectives: Detailed knowledge on the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the clinical characteristics of mild COVID-19 is essential for effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19. Methods: Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea. The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Results: Of the 213 individuals with COVID-19, 41 (19.2%) were asymptomatic until admission. Among the remaining patients with mild COVID-19, the most common symptom was cough (40.1%; 69/172), followed by hyposmia (39.5%; 68/172) and sputum (39.5%; 68/172). Of the 68 individuals with hyposmia, 61 (90%) had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea. Fever (>37.5°C) was only observed in 20 (11.6%) individuals. Conclusions: As much as one-fifth of individuals with COVID-19 remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission. Hyposmia was quite frequent among individuals with mild COVID-19, but fever was not. Social distancing should be strongly implemented to prevent disease transmission from asymptomatic individuals or those with mild and inconspicuous symptoms.",covid
"To discuss whether the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), World Health Organization (WHO) organized the 15-member International Health Regulations Emergency Committee (EC). On January 22-23 and January 30, 2020, EC convened and discussed whether the situation in China and other countries would constitute PHEIC and issued recommendations for WHO, China and the international community. Based on the recommendations of EC, WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a PHEIC. One of the purposes of the declaration of PHEIC was to alarm countries with weak public health infrastructures to prepare promptly for emerging infectious diseases (EID) and provide WHO with a framework for proactively supporting those countries. On February 3, 2020, WHO proposed the 2019 COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, which includes accelerating research and development (R&D) processes as one of three major strategies. On February 11-12, 2020, WHO held the Global Research and Innovation Forum: Towards a Research Roadmap for COVID-19. The fact that a COVID-19 R&D forum was the first meeting convened after the PHEIC declaration testifies to the importance of R&D in response to EID. Korea has demonstrated a remarkable capacity in its laboratory response by conducting high-throughput COVID-19 testing and utilizing innovative drive-through samplings. These measures for early detection and screening of cases should be followed by full efforts to produce research-based evidence by thoroughly analyzing epidemiological, clinical and immunological data, which will facilitate the development of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. It is expected that Korea plays a global partner for COVID-19 research by actively participating in immediate and mid/long-term priorities jointly led by WHO and global partners.",covid
"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, can cause a potentially fatal disease, COVID-19, in humans. Here, we will provide an overview of therapeutic options for COVID-19. Plasma from patients recovered from COVID-19 that contains antibodies against SARS-CoV2 has shown promising results in patients with severe COVID-19. Also, IVIG, combined with moderate-dose of corticosteroids, might improve patient outcomes. Evidence links COVID-19 to variable degrees of inflammation. Studies show that the use of corticosteroids might accelerate recovery from COVID-19. There are, however, no controlled clinical trials that show whether the use of corticosteroids can reduce COVID-19-related death. Also, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 is the best-documented cytokine in COVID-19 correlated with severity, criticality, viral load, and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, could confer clinical benefit in patients with high IL6 levels. Essential elements that process SARS-CoV2 cell entry and specific characteristics that allow SARS-CoV2 to escape the immune system have the potential as targets for COVID-19 therapy.",covid
"Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has profound psychological and social effects. The psychological sequelae of the pandemic will probably persist for months and years to come. Studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression, and insomnia in the general population and among health care professionals. Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress, and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable populations including individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and people who reside in high COVID-19 prevalence areas. Stress-related psychiatric conditions including mood and substance use disorders are associated with suicidal behavior. COVID-19 survivors may also be at elevated suicide risk. The COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide rates during and after the pandemic. Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis including suicidal behavior are likely to be present for a long time and peak later than the actual pandemic. To reduce suicides during the COVID-19 crisis it is imperative to decrease stress, anxiety, fears and loneliness in the general population. There should be traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress. Active outreach is necessary, especially for people with a history of psychiatric disorders, COVID-19 survivors, and older adults. Research studies are needed of how mental health consequences can be mitigated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Since the outbreak of COVID-19 or coronavirus disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from Wuhan, China, the cardiology fraternity's interest has been drawn towards the pandemic with a high case fatality rate of 10.5% and 6% in patients with heart disease and hypertension, respectively. One of the postulated mechanisms for this high fatality rate is the possible abundance of ACE type 2 receptor in the cardiovascular system that strongly binds with the spike protein of COVID-19 and helps internalise into the cell resulting in acute cardiac injury (ACI). More than 7% of cases with COVID-19 are reported to have this type of ACI. A tenfold rise in mortality has been observed in patients with COVID-19 who experience a rise in high-sensitivity (hs)-troponin. All most half of the patients who died of COVID-19 had a rise in hs-troponin. More than 15% of cases with COVID-19 experienced different types of arrhythmias. All these statistics denote how important cardiovascular pathology is in patients with COVID-19. Controversies of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors usage in patients with COVID-19 and meticulous handling of case with acute coronary syndrome categorically stresses cardiologists to bust the myths hovering around and set a standard guideline to counterfeit the fatality with timely diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19-induced ACI. In this review, we sought to summarise the current evidence of COVID-19-associated cardiac injury and suggest the implications for its proper diagnosis and treatment.",covid
"Effective treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak are urgently needed. While anti-viral approaches and vaccines are being considered immediate countermeasures are unavailable. The aim of this article is to outline a perspective on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the context of the currently available clinical data published in the literature. This article appreciates clinical data published on COVID-19 in the context of another respiratory illness - high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Both conditions have significant similarities that portend pathophysiologic trajectories. Following this potential treatment options emerge. Both COVID-19 and HAPE exhibit a decreased ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen with concomitant hypoxia and tachypnea. There also appears to be a tendency for low carbon dioxide levels in both as well. Radiologic findings of ground glass opacities are present in up to 86% of patients with COVID-19 in addition to patchy infiltrates. Patients with HAPE also exhibit patchy infiltrates throughout the pulmonary fields, often in an asymmetric pattern and CT findings reveal increased lung markings and ground glass-like changes as well. Widespread ground-glass opacities are most commonly a manifestation of hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Similarly, elevated fibrinogen levels in both conditions are likely an epiphenomenon of edema formation rather than coagulation activation. Autopsy results of a COVID-19 fatality revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage associated with pulmonary edema, pro-inflammatory concentrates, and indications of early-phase acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). HAPE itself is initially caused by an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure and induces altered alveolar-capillary permeability via high pulmonary artery hydrostatic pressures that lead to a protein-rich and mildly hemorrhagic edema. It appears that COVID-19 and HAPE both discretely converge on ARDS. In light of this, a countermeasure that has been shown to be effective in the analogous condition of HAPE is Acetazolamide. Acetazolamide has a myriad of effects on different organ systems, potently reduces hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, improves minute ventilation and expired vital capacity. Other therapeutics to consider that are also directed towards decreased pulmonary pressure include Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase inhibitors. This review describes COVID-19 in parallel to HAPE. Deranged respiratory parameters that are present in both conditions are highlighted. The utilization of medications found to be effective in HAPE, for the treatment of COVID-19, is proposed. Given the medical emergency of a growing contagion and the thousands of lives at stake, expedient attempts to improve survival are needed. Acetazolamide, Nifedipine and Phosphodiesterase inhibitors may be potential countermeasures.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) arose at a time of great concern about antimicrobial resistance (AMR). No studies have specifically assessed COVID-19-associated superinfections or AMR. Based on limited data from case series, it is reasonable to anticipate that an appreciable minority of patients with severe COVID-19 will develop superinfections, most commonly pneumonia due to nosocomial bacteria and Aspergillus. Microbiology and AMR patterns are likely to reflect institutional ecology. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial use is likely to be widespread among hospitalized patients, both as directed and empiric therapy. Stewardship will have a crucial role in limiting unnecessary antimicrobial use and AMR. Congressional COVID-19 relief bills are considering antimicrobial reimbursement reforms and antimicrobial subscription models, but it is unclear if these will be included in final legislation. Prospective studies on COVID-19 superinfections are needed, data from which can inform rational antimicrobial treatment and stewardship strategies, and models for market reform and sustainable drug development.",covid
"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected people from all cultures, religions, gender, and age groups around the world. In the last few months, several studies have been conducted on various aspects of COVID-19. Our goal was to see if the pediatric population is vulnerable to this infection. In this review, we conducted extensive research mainly by using the PubMed database. We used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and associated keywords to engage in an extensive search focussing on COVID-19 in the pediatric population. We discovered that most of the studies were from China, and some of them were in the Chinese language. However, English translations of many of the studies were available. For accessing the relevant statistical data, we relied on the World Health Organization (WHO) resources and the official website of the Ontario Government (ontario.ca). Most of the studies showed that the virus has affected the pediatric population. However, we found some differences among these studies regarding the severity of symptoms in children affected by COVID-19. While a few studies stated that the virus has presented with milder symptoms in the pediatric population, some studies have presented data of children who have suffered life-threatening complications due to COVID-19. Although the data is limited, we have been able to conclude from the studies we reviewed that COVID-19 does indeed affect children the same way as any other age group. Moreover, children can act as carriers of the virus and can endanger the lives of other individuals. Besides, neonates and infants can easily acquire the infection from family members without having any exposure to the outside world. Hence, utmost care should be taken while handling this population. More trials and studies should be conducted to analyze the impact of early diagnosis of infection in children and its management.",covid
"Objectives: Current events with the recent COVID-19 outbreak are necessitating steep learning curves for the NHS workforce. Ultrasound, although not used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 may be utilised by practitioners at the point of care (POC) or on the intensive care units (ITUs) where rapid assessment of the lung condition may be required. The aim of this article was to review current literature surrounding the use of lung ultrasound in relation to COVID-19 and provide Sonographers with a quick and digestible reference guide for lung pathologies. Key findings: Ultrasound is being used in Italy and China to help review lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak however not strictly as a diagnostic tool as Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest and chest radiographs are currently gold standard. Ultrasound is highly sensitive in the detection of multiple lung pathologies which can be demonstrated in conjunction with COVID-19 however to date there are no specific, nor pathognomonic findings which relate to COVID-19 on ultrasound. Conclusion: Lung ultrasound is highly sensitive and can quickly and accurately review lung condition creating potential to assess for changes or resolution over time, especially in the ITU and POC setting. However it should not be used as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 due to low specificity in relation to the virus. Implications for practice: The adoption of lung ultrasound to monitor lung condition during the COVID-19 outbreak may reduce the need for serial exposure to ionising radiation on the wards and in turn reduce the number of radiographers required to attend infected wards and bays, protecting both patients and the workforce.",covid
"Background: This systematic review had three aims: i) to determine the frequency of anosmia (or other smell disorders) and dysgeusia (or other taste disorders) in COVID-19 patients; ii) to determine whether anosmia or dysgeusia are independently associated with COVID-19 diagnosis; and iii) to determine whether anosmia or dysgeusia are prognostic factors for impaired outcomes among COVID-19 patients. Methods: On April 20 th, 2020, we search MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science and MedXriv. We used terms related to COVID-19, smell and taste disorders. We selected case series, cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies. We included studies with COVID-19 patients describing their symptoms; studies that compared smell and taste disorders between COVID-19 patients and otherwise healthy subjects; and studies comparing smell and taste disorders between COVID-19 severe and mild/moderate cases. Because of methodological heterogeneity and the limited number of results, a qualitative synthesis is presented. Results: From 31 reports, we selected six (n=2,757). Six studies reported the proportion of smell and taste disorders among COVID-19 patients. Two reports studied whether smell and taste disorders were independently associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. No reports studied the association with impaired outcomes among COVID-19 patients. The frequency of anosmia ranged between 22%-68%. The definition of taste disorders varied greatly, with dysgeusia present in 33% and ageusia in 20%. People who reported loss of smell and taste had six-fold higher odds of being COVID-19 positive; similarly, anosmia and ageusia were associated with 10-fold higher odds of COVID-19 diagnosis. Conclusions: The frequency of smell and taste disorders is as high as other symptoms, thus, at least anosmia for which the definition was more consistent, could be included in lists of COVID-19 symptoms. Although there is promising evidence, it is premature to conclude that smell and taste disorders are strongly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020181308.",covid
"Mortality from Covid-19 is monitored in detail and compared between countries with different strategies against the virus. There is, however, often a lack of understanding of what is required in terms of measures and interpretation to enable correct comparisons. The number of deaths from Covid-19 is affected by the testing strategy and many other things that differ between countries. Therefore, today, the most reliable source for monitoring and comparing mortality from Covid-19 is total mortality. In Sweden, there is good correspondence of Covid-19 deaths and total mortality, with a tendency to a higher total mortality indicating some under-reporting of Covid-19 mortality.",covid
"The first cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Cutaneous manifestations are among the heterogenous clinical features of the disease, and urticaria is one of the most common skin manifestations reported in COVID-19. We reviewed the literature available regarding COVID-19-associated urticaria. A literature search in the PubMed and Scopus databases was conducted, till the cut-off date of 24th July 2020, using the following terms: ""skin"" or ""cutaneous"" or ""urticaria"" or ""urticarial,"" and ""COVID-19"" or coronavirus disease. The search resulted in 502 publications. In this review, 30 articles with a total of 202 patients with COVID-19-associated urticaria were included. Patient age ranged from 2 months to 84 years. Gender was reported in 149 patients; of these 96 (64%) were females, and 53 (36%) were males. Of the 105 patients with a determined onset of the disease, 58 (55%) presented with rash preceding or concurrently with the classic COVID-19 symptoms. Urticarial rash was mainly either generalized or distributed on the trunk. Associated respiratory symptoms, level of care, medications used, comorbidities, and duration, and distribution and timeline of urticarial rash were summarized. In this article, we present a review of literature on COVID-19-associated urticaria, which would enable dermatologists and other clinicians to diagnose COVID-19 early in the onset of disease, and prevent viral spread. Additionally, this may also pave the way for further studies on this topic.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has officially been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Radiological examinations, especially computed tomography (CT), play an important role in the fight against COVID-19. A comprehensive and timely review of radiological role in the fight against COVID-19 remains urgent and mandatory. Hence, the aim of this review is to summarize the radiological role in the fight against COVID-19. This review of current studies on COVID-19 provides insight into the radiological role in the detection, diagnosis, and monitoring for COVID-19. The typical radiological features of COVID-19 include bilateral, multifocal, and multilobar ground glass opacification with patchy consolidation, a peripheral/subpleural or posterior distribution (or both), mainly in the lower lobes. A combination of chest CT and repeat Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing may be beneficial for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the setting of strongly clinical suspicion. Chest CT may improve the sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis, but patients' exposure to radiation should be kept as low as possible especially for children and pregnant women patients.",covid
"Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic affecting millions of individuals, killing hundreds of thousands. Although typically described with characteristic symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, greater understanding of COVID-19 has revealed myriad clinical manifestations. Olfactory dysfunction (OD)-hyposmia and anosmia-has recently been recognized as an important symptom of COVID-19 and increasingly gained traction as a public health tool for identifying COVID-19 patients, in particular otherwise asymptomatic carriers who, unawares, may be major drivers of disease spread. The objective of this study is to review the scientific evidence about anosmia in COVID-19. Data sources: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Review methods: Comprehensive literature search of primary studies pertinent to the objectives of this review using the chosen data sources. Conclusions: Current evidence shows that OD is highly prevalent in COVID-19, with up to 80% of patients reporting subjective OD and objective olfactory testing potentially showing even higher prevalence. OD is frequently accompanied by taste dysfunction. Up to 25% of COVID-19 patients may experience sudden-onset OD as the first symptom. A large proportion of COVID-19 OD cases may resolve over the period of a few weeks. Implications for practice: Sudden anosmia should be considered a symptom of COVID-19. Assessing for sudden-onset anosmia may increase sensitivity of COVID-19 screening strategies, in particular for identifying patients at the earliest stages of disease. Since many cases of OD due to COVID-19 may resolve in the short term, conservative management, including observation, is reasonable, while advanced imaging is unnecessary.",covid
"Importance: Vitamin D treatment has been found to decrease incidence of viral respiratory tract infection, especially in vitamin D deficiency. It is unknown whether COVID-19 incidence is associated with vitamin D deficiency and treatment. Objective: To examine whether vitamin D deficiency and treatment are associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: University of Chicago Medicine Participants: Patients tested for COVID-19 from 3/3/2020-4/10/2020. Vitamin D deficiency was defined by the most recent 25-hydroxycholecalciferol <20ng/ml or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol <18pg/ml within 1 year before COVID-19 testing. Treatment was defined by the most recent vitamin D type and dose, and treatment changes between the time of the most recent vitamin D level and time of COVID-19 testing. Vitamin D deficiency and treatment changes were combined to categorize vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing as likely deficient(last-level-deficient/treatment-not-increased), likely sufficient(last-level-not-deficient/treatment-not-decreased), or uncertain deficiency(last-level-deficient/treatment-increased or last-level-not-deficient/treatment-decreased). Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was testing positive for COVID-19. Multivariable analysis tested whether the most recent vitamin D level and treatment changes after that level were associated with testing positive for COVID-19 controlling for demographic and comorbidity indicators. Bivariate analyses of associations of treatment with vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 were performed. Results: Among 4,314 patients tested for COVID-19, 499 had a vitamin D level in the year before testing. Vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing was categorized as likely deficient for 127(25%) patients, likely sufficient for 291(58%) patients, and uncertain for 81(16%) patients. In multivariate analysis, testing positive for COVID-19 was associated with increasing age(RR(age<50)=1.05,p<0.021;RR(age≥50)=1.02,p<0.064)), non-white race(RR=2.54,p<0.01) and being likely vitamin D deficient (deficient/treatment-not-increased:RR=1.77,p<0.02) as compared to likely vitamin D sufficient(not-deficient/treatment-not-decreased), with predicted COVID-19 rates in the vitamin D deficient group of 21.6%(95%CI[14.0%-29.2%] ) versus 12.2%(95%CI[8.9%-15.4%]) in the vitamin D sufficient group. Vitamin D deficiency declined with increasing vitamin D dose, especially of vitamin D3. Vitamin D dose was not significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Conclusions and relevance: Vitamin D deficiency that is not sufficiently treated is associated with COVID-19 risk. Testing and treatment for vitamin D deficiency to address COVID-19 warrant aggressive pursuit and study.",covid
"The long-term sequelae of COVID-19 on are not yet predictable. Radiological and histopathological data on COVID-19 and observational studies after the SARS-CoV-1 pandemic 2003/2004 suggest that in a proportion of COVID-19 patients, functional limitations due to pulmonary fibrosis and other patterns of lung damage may persist. Systematic follow-up, based on prudent pulmonary function testing, is warranted for the correct diagnosis, graduation and treatment of the underlying pathology at an early stage. This review summarizes the potential spectrum of Post-COVID-19 pulmonary disease patterns and provides recommendations for the follow-up care of COVID-19 patients in the field of respiratory medicine.",covid
"Background and aims: COVID-19 is a public world crisis, however, it is a self-limited infection. In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. Methods: This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. Results: This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19. Conclusion: This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.",covid
"In December, 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China and quickly spread globally. As of May 7, 2020, there were 3 672 238 confirmed infections and 254 045 deaths attributed to COVID-19. Evidence has shown that there are asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 who can transmit the disease to others. The virus incubation time shows a wide range (0-24 days) and the virus displays a high infectivity. It is therefore urgent to develop an effective therapy to treat patients with COVID-19 and to control the spread of the causative agent, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Repurposing of approved drugs is widely adopted to fight newly emerged diseases such as COVID-19, as these drugs have known pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. As pathological examination has confirmed the involvement of immune hyperactivation and acute respiratory distress syndrome in fatal cases of COVID-19, several disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS), such as hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab, have been proposed as potential therapies for the treatment of COVID-19. In this Review, we discuss the immunological aspects of COVID-19 and the potential implication of DMARDs in treating this disease.",covid
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused significant morbidity and mortality for patients and stressed healthcare systems worldwide. The clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 among immunosuppressed patients, who are at presumed risk for more severe disease but who may also have decreased detrimental inflammatory responses, are not well characterized. We review the existing literature on COVID-19 among immunocompromised populations ranging from cancer patients and solid organ transplant recipients to patients with HIV and those receiving immunomodulatory therapy for autoimmune disease. Patients with malignancy and solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death whereas for those with other types of immunocompromise, current evidence is less clear. Overall, further prospective, controlled studies are needed to determine the attributable risk of immunocompromising conditions and therapies on COVID-19 disease prognosis.",covid
"Introduction: This ecological study investigates the association between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 occurrence and mortality in 38 European nations as of May 30, 2020. Methods: Data were collected from Our World in Data. Regression analysis was conducted to adjust for potential confounding factors such as economic activity (gross domestic product), the rate of COVID-19 testing, and the stringency of COVID-19 control policies. Results: There was a statistically significant negative association between smoking prevalence and the prevalence of COVID-19 across the 38 European nations after controlling for confounding factors (p = 0.001). A strong association was found between the prevalence of COVID-19 per million people and economic activity (p = 0.002) and the rate of COVID-19 testing (p = 0.0006). Nations with stricter policy enactment showed fewer COVID-19 cases per million people, but the association was not significant (p = 0.122). Delaying policy enactment was associated with a greater prevalence of COVID-19 (p = 0.0535). Evidence of a direct association between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality was not found (p = 0.626). There was a strong positive association between COVID-19 mortality rate and the prevalence of COVID-19 cases (p < 0.0001) as well as the proportion of the population over 65 years of age (p = 0.0034) and a negative association with the rate of COVID-19 testing (p = 0.0023). Conclusions: We found a negative association between smoking prevalence and COVID-19 occurrence at the population level in 38 European countries. This association may not imply a true or causal relationship, and smoking is not advocated as a prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Implications: Given the evidence of this ecological study, and of several other studies that found an underrepresentation of smoking prevalence in hospitalized cases, it may be worth examining, in laboratory experiments and controlled human trials, if nicotine offers any protection against COVID-19. Most importantly, to date, no study, including this one, supports the view that smoking acts as a treatment intervention or prophylaxis to reduce the impact or ameliorate the negative health impacts of COVID-19.",covid

"Background and aims: Data show that vitamin D deficiency may play a role in patients with diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 infection. In this article, we review evidence of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection in context of diabetes mellitus. Methods: A literature search was carried out by using the key term 'COVID 19' combined with 'Diabetes', 'Vitamin D', 'Extra skeletal effects', 'immunity', 'infection', 'India' from Pub Med (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD and Google Scholar from December 2019 to May 2020. A manual search of the references was also carried out. Results: Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality in COVID -19 infections but convincing data on diabetic subgroup of patients in particular is still awaited. Conclusion: Robust studies are required to ascertain if Vitamin D supplementation could be beneficial in patients with diabetes and COVID-19.",covid
"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 has a number of similarities to SARS and MERS diseases. Its highly contagious nature is particularly due to the rapid spread of the disease through asymptomatic individuals; however, the worlds most contagious infectious disease is still considered measles. Scientific data have revealed the interactions between COVID-19 and the immune system. These findings may contribute to the development of novel preventive and therapeutic approaches. Just as coronavirus itself the reports about the disease have massively spread through media and public contributing to overall public fear and stress. This promotion of non-scientific evidence and misinformation through social media might have also a devastating impact on the individuals immune system. Data regarding the mortality rates of COVID-19 have achieved unprecedented media and public engagements, however, the true facts about the disease prevention, immunomodulation and novel treatments are often left unsaid.

"Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has neurological symptoms. COVID-19 patients have such clinical symptoms as headache, vomiting, nausea, dizziness, myalgia, anosmia, ageusia, and disorder of consciousness. These symptoms confirm that the nervous system is involved in the COVID-19 infection. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a heterogeneous disorder which often follows a viral infection. According to the assessment case reports from the beginning of the COVID-19 infection so far, it is possible that GBS is linked to the COVID-19 infection. It seems that paying attention to the neurological effects of COVID-19 is necessary.",covid
"There is debate as to whether olfactory dysfunction should be considered a symptom of COVID-19 infection. We undertook a systematic literature review of the articles indexed in PubMed on olfactory disorders in viral respiratory tract conditions, with special emphasis on COVID-19. The main objective was to find evidence of clinical interest to support the relationship between anosmia and COVID-19. Olfactory disorders in upper respiratory tract infections are frequent, most caused by obstruction due to oedema of the nasal mucosa. Occasionally, post-viral sensorineural olfactory dysfunction occurs, with a variable prognosis. The evidence on anosmia in COVID-19 patients is extremely limited, corresponding to a level 5 or D of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. According to the available evidence, it seems reasonable to apply isolation, hygiene and social distancing measures in patients with recent olfactory disorders as the only symptom, although the usefulness of diagnostic tests for this type of patient should be studied.",covid
"Purpose: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has quickly spread around the globe. Health care facilities in the USA currently do not have an adequate supply of COVID-19 tests to meet the growing demand. Imaging findings for COVID-19 are non-specific but include pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass opacities in a predominantly basal and peripheral distribution. Methods: Three patients were imaged for non-respiratory-related symptoms with a portion of the lungs in the imaged field. Results: Each patient had suspicious imaging findings for COVID-19, prompting the interpreting radiologist to suggest testing for COVID-19. All 3 patients turned out to be infected with COVID-19, and one patient is the first reported case of the coincident presentation of COVID-19 and an intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Conclusion: Using imaging characteristics of COVID-19 on abdominal or neck CT when a portion of the lungs is included, patients not initially suspected of COVID-19 infection can be quarantined earlier to limit exposure to others.",covid
"Introduction: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Although the main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is respiratory involvement, there is evidence suggesting the neuroinvasive potential of COVID-19. There are limited reports of neurological complications of COVID-19 infection in the literature. Herein, we aim to describe 2 members of a family affected by COVID-19, presenting with ascending paresthesia with the final diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Case report: A 38-year-old man presented with a history of ascending paresthesia and bilateral facial droop since 5 days before admission. The medical history was positive for flu-like symptoms affecting all the members of his family. The neurological examination was notable for bilateral peripheral facial paralysis, generalized areflexia, and derceased sensation in distal limbs. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed an albuminocytologic dissociation. In addition, the electromyography-nerve conduction study findings were suggestive of acute axonal-demyelinating polyneuropathy. Meanwhile the patient was treated with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome, his 14-year-old daughter presented with a history of progressive paresthesia and weakness. Similar to her father, the paraclinical evaluations were consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Taking into account clinical findings and the outbreak of COVID-19, the suspicion of COVID-19 was proposed. Eventually, on the basis of throat swab samples stand on polymerase chain reaction, the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusion: Our cases revealed the familial occurrence of Guillain-Barré syndrome after COVID-19 infection. The authors emphasize neurological complications of COVID-19.",covid
"The pneumonia caused by the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. The gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain and the detection of COVID-19 nucleic acid from fecal specimens in a small number of patients suggest the possibility of transmission via the gastrointestinal tract. People of all ages are vulnerable to this virus, including children. Digestive endoscopy is an invasive procedure during which children cannot wear masks; therefore, they have higher risks of exposure to COVID-19, and the digestive endoscopy center is a relatively high-risk area for COVID-19 infection. Based on these factors and in combination with related policies and regulations, a prevention and control program for the COVID-19 pneumonia in a children's digestive endoscopy center was established to prevent the COVID-19 nosocomial infection.",covid
"At the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan city, China. As of April 15, 2020, >1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed worldwide, including >120,000 deaths. There is an urgent need to monitor and predict COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most affected countries of Europe. The prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization website. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these regions. Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other countries.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people globally. Clinically, it presents with mild flu-like symptoms in most cases but can cause respiratory failure in high risk population. With the aim of unearthing newer treatments, scientists all over the globe are striving hard to comprehend the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19. Several studies till date have indicated a dysregulated host immune response as the major cause of COVID-19 induced mortality. In this Perspective, we propose a key role of endothelium, particularly pulmonary endothelium in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. We draw parallels and divergences between COVID-19-induced respiratory distress and bacterial sepsis-induced lung injury and recommend the road ahead with respect to identification of endothelium-based biomarkers and plausible treatments for COVID-19.",covid
"Up to 20%-30% of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have evidence of myocardial involvement. Acute cardiac injury in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. There are no data on how acute treatment of COVID-19 may affect the convalescent phase or long-term cardiac recovery and function. Myocarditis from other viral pathogens can evolve into overt or subclinical myocardial dysfunction, and sudden death has been described in the convalescent phase of viral myocarditis. This raises concerns for patients recovering from COVID-19. Some patients will have subclinical and possibly overt cardiovascular abnormalities. Patients with ostensibly recovered cardiac function may still be at risk of cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias. Screening for residual cardiac involvement in the convalescent phase for patients recovered from COVID-19-associated cardiac injury is needed. The type of testing and therapies for post COVID-19 myocardial dysfunction will need to be determined. Therefore, now is the time to plan for appropriate registries and clinical trials to properly assess these issues and prepare for long-term sequelae of ""post-COVID-19 cardiac syndrome.""",covid
"By the spring of 2020 the COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has become a pandemic, requiring fast and efficient reaction from societies and health care systems all over the world. Fever, coughing and dyspnea are considered the major signs of COVID-19. In addition to the involvement of the respiratory system, the infection may result in other symptoms and signs as well. Based on reports to date, neurological signs or symptoms appear in 30-50% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with higher incidence in those with more severe disease. Classical acute neurological syndromes have also been reported to associate with COVID-19. A drop in the volume of services for other acute diseases has been described in countries with healthcare systems focusing on COVID-19. During the COVID-19 epidemic it is also important to provide appropriate continuous care for those with chronic neurological disorders. It will be the task of the future to estimate the collateral damage caused by the COVID-19 epidemic on the outcome of other neurological disorders, and to screen for the possible late neurological complications of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection.",covid

"Background: There is concern about susceptibility of psoriatic patients on biologics to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its clinical course.Purpose: The aims of present review were to determine whether the biologic treatment of psoriasis increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and if biologics affect the clinical course of COVID-19 in these patients.Methods: We searched database of MEDLINE (PubMed) for key term of psoriasis biologic and COVID-19 until June 9, 2020 and all published 14 papers and an experience from Iran (10509 cases) related to the psoriatic patients on biologics and COVID-19 along with relevant papers were summarized. In spite of limitation in some reports, due to some of strengths that will be discussed, all papers were included in this review.Results: According to 8769 medical reports around 0.3% of psoriatic patients had COVID-19 and the rate of hospitalization was 0.1%. No death due to COVID-19 was reported among 10509 patients. Reports indicated psoriatic patients on biologics were not more susceptible to COVID-19 and the severe clinical course of disease.Conclusion: While there is not definitive controlled trial data, the available evidence suggests that patients with psoriasis without COVID-19 can continue the biologic therapy for psoriasis.",covid
"COVID-19 has led to stigma and discrimination among various groups of people in different populations. Healthcare workers caring for those affected by COVID-19,3 people who have recovered from COVID-19,4 those belonging to lower socioeconomic groups, those having particular religious and racial identities have all been at the receiving end of the discrimination. COVID-19 has led to reinforcement of preexisting stereotypes against various groups. For instance, in Italy, in weeks before the national lockdown started, a state of emergency was declared but everyday life was going on as always, the sentiment toward the Chinese community changed: their restaurants were left empty, more and more parents did not want their children to go to school if they had a Chinese classmate, and a high-profile politician said on TV that 'we have all seen them eat live mice'.",covid
"The COVID-19 outbreak is a great threat to public health worldwide. Lung injury is the main outcome of COVID-19 infection; however, damage can occur in other organs including the liver. Currently, limited data are available that link underlying liver injury with the severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review summarizes the available data on liver test abnormalities in COVID-19 patients; critically evaluates the possible causes of liver injury and provides recommendations for clinicians. In laboratory tests, serum levels of liver test markers notably transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and total bilirubin were significantly higher in severe patients with COVID-19 infection. The use of certain drugs especially lopinavir and ritonavir showed an association with the progression of liver damage in severe cases. Available data suggest that liver injury in COVID-19 patients may result from direct effect by the virus, immune-mediated inflammation or drug-induced toxicity. Some studies demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing liver disease are at higher risk for hospitalizations and mortality. Therefore, the impact of pre-existing liver disease on treatment and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 should be determined. Large-scale clinical studies are needed to identify the causes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 infection.",covid
"The novel coronavirus is rapidly spreading around the world.

The effect of many of the drugs used for treatment of Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) on COVID-19 is not clear. We also do not have data on the impact of this autoimmune disease, which may involve the mucous membranes, on the acquisition or course of COVID-19. We are currently in the midst of a pandemic and evaluating the effect of COVID-19 on the population of susceptible patients suffering from auto-immune diseases like pemphigus is essential.

"Just before 2020 began, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), brought for humans a potentially fatal disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The world has thoroughly been affected by COVID-19, while there has been little progress towards understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Patients with a severe phenotype of disease and those who died from the disease have shown hyperinflammation and were more likely to develop neurological manifestations, linking the clinical disease with neuroimmunological features. Anosmia frequently occurs early in the course of COVID-19. The prevalence of anosmia would be influenced by self-diagnosis as well as self-misdiagnosis in patients with COVID-19. Despite this, the association between anosmia and COVID-19 has been a hope for research, aiming to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Studies have suggested differently probable mechanisms for the development of anosmia in COVID-19, including olfactory cleft syndrome, postviral anosmia syndrome, cytokine storm, direct damage of olfactory sensory neurons, and impairment of the olfactory perception center in the brain. Thus, the observation of anosmia would direct us to find the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in the central nervous system, and this is consistent with numerous neurological manifestations related to COVID-19. Like other neurotropic viruses, SARS-CoV-2 might be able to enter the central nervous system via the olfactory epithelium and induce innate immune responses at the site of entry. Viral replication in the nonneural olfactory cells indirectly causes damage to the olfactory receptor nerves, and as a consequence, anosmia occurs. Further studies are required to investigate the neuroimmunology of COVID-19 in relation to anosmia.",covid
"Worldwide, several hospitals in different regions and countries have been affected with Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19). All medical specialties including gastroenterology are impacted by COVID-19. Here, we review the bidirectional comorbidity of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and COVID-19, including the incidence and outcome of COVID-19 in individuals with various GI disorders and the impact of COVID-19 on the course and outcome of the underlying (or comorbid) GI disorders. Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 is more (or less) frequent in comorbid GI disorders. It is also reassuring that the outcome of COVID-19 is unaffected by the underlying GI disorder or its treatment, though potential concerns remain in regard to the use of immunomodulatory treatments in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and liver transplant recipients. Despite these concerns, there is now agreement among experts that ongoing immunomodulatory treatments may not be interrupted in individuals with IBD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caution, however, may be exercised with the use of corticosteroids in the management of IBD. In addition, COVID-19 does not appear to impact the manifestations, course, outcome, and treatment of comorbid GI disorders, e.g. IBD. Decompensation of liver cirrhosis is, however, possible during COVID-19 episodes. A direct concern, however, might relate to the potential transmission of the virus through fecal microbiota transplants.",covid

"Background: Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease that has spread rapidly across the world. Many studies have already evaluated the clinical features of COVID-19, but how it compares with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-negative community-acquired pneumonia (SN-CAP) is still unclear. Moreover, COVID-19 mortality is correlated with disease severity, but indicators for severity grading have not been specified. We aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison with SN-CAP and find indicators for disease severity in COVID-19. Methods: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and SN-CAP were enrolled. Clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were analyzed. Results: The numbers of COVID-19 and SN-CAP patients enrolled were 304 and 138, respectively. The age of the patients was not significantly different between the groups. Compared with SN-CAP, COVID-19 patients had more symptoms of fever and dyspnea; and showed significant difference in blood count results. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID-19 patients showed patchy ground-glass opacities that correlated with disease severity, whereas the CT imaging of SN-CAP patients showed patchy high-density shadows. COVID-19 patients were classified into moderate, severe, and critically severe groups. The severe and critically severe groups had elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, platelets, C-reaction protein (CRP), lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), troponin-I, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). However, they had decreased levels of lymphocytes, lymphocyte ratio, and albumin. Compared with the younger patients, the older COVID-19 individuals had more chronic diseases and significantly elevated levels of WBC, neutrophil, and CRP levels. Conclusion: SN-CAP showed more inflammatory reaction than COVID-19. Old people with chronic diseases are more susceptible to COVID-19 and have a high likelihood of developing severe and critically severe infection. Levels of WBC, lymphocytes, neutrophils, CRP, NLR, PLR, troponin-I, creatinine, and BUN are important indicators for severity grading in COVID-19.",covid

"Understanding the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 through the lens of mathematical models is an elusive but significant goal. Within only half a year, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 19 million reported cases across 188 countries with more than 700,000 deaths worldwide. Unlike any other disease in history, COVID-19 has generated an unprecedented volume of data, well documented, continuously updated, and broadly available to the general public. Yet, the precise role of mathematical modeling in providing quantitative insight into the COVID-19 pandemic remains a topic of ongoing debate. Here we discuss the lessons learned from six month of modeling COVID-19. We highlight the early success of classical models for infectious diseases and show why these models fail to predict the current outbreak dynamics of COVID-19. We illustrate how data-driven modeling can integrate classical epidemiology modeling and machine learning to infer critical disease parameters-in real time-from reported case data to make informed predictions and guide political decision making. We critically discuss questions that these models can and cannot answer and showcase controversial decisions around the early outbreak dynamics, outbreak control, and exit strategies. We anticipate that this summary will stimulate discussion within the modeling community and help provide guidelines for robust mathematical models to understand and manage the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused infection in a season when influenza is still prevalent. Both viruses have similar transmission characteristics and common clinical manifestations. Influenza has been described to cause respiratory infection with some other respiratory pathogens. However, the information of COVID-19 and influenza coinfection is limited. In this study, we reported our coinfected cases and reviewed the literature. We included all COVID-19 diagnosed patients. All patients with a presumed diagnosis of COVID-19 were routinely screened for influenza. Their thorax radiology was reviewed for COVID-19-influenza differentiation. During the study period, 1103 patients have been diagnosed with COVID-19. Among them, six patients (0.54%) were diagnosed coinfected with influenza. There have been 28 more coinfected patients reported. Laboratory-based screening studies reported more patients. Thorax radiology findings were compatible with COVID-19 in five and with influenza in one of our patients. Our cases were mild to moderate in severity. The reported cases in the literature included patients died (n = 2) and those living ventilator dependent or under mechanical ventilation. COVID-19 and influenza coinfection is rare. Screening studies report more cases, suggesting that unless screening patients with COVID-19, the coinfection remains undiagnosed and underestimated. Increasing experience in thoracic radiology may contribute to diagnose the responsible virus(es) from the clinical illness. Influenza vaccine for larger population groups can be recommended to simplify clinicians' work.",covid
"Treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients with CKD requires special pharmacotherapy considerations that are reviewed here. Literature review was done for several pharmacotherapy aspects in CKD patients including selection and modification of COVID-19 treatment, drug interactions, nephrotoxicity of drugs that are used for treatment of COVID-19 and potential risks/benefits of routine medications of CKD patients during COVID-19 pandemic. CKD patients should be treated according to local or national COVID-19 protocols as other patients. But, there is no data on using remdesivir in patients with severe CKD. Oseltamivir and ribavirin require dose modification in patients with moderate to severe CKD. Nephrolithiasis, CKD, and acute interstitial nephritis have been reported with protease inhibitors. Acute kidney injury has been reported with remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19. Pharmacokinetic-enhanced protease inhibitors increase the concentration of some drugs such as statins, cinacalcet, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). Some hypothetical benefits and harms have been suggested for statins and renin-angiotensinaldosterone system inhibitors in COVID-19 patients. Continuing guideline-directed administration of these drugs is recommended. Among different immunomodulating/immunosuppressive drugs, hydroxychloroquine and CNIs are the safest ones during COVID-19. Antimetabolites are suggested to be withheld during moderate to severe COVID-19. Fluid therapy and anticoagulant prophylaxis/ treatment need special attention in CKD patients with COVID-19. CKD patients with COVID-19 are treated as other patients, with some dose modifications if needed. Be mindful for management of drug interactions as well as modification of immunosuppressive drugs in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.",covid

"Objective: To analyze headaches related to COVID-19 based on personal case experience. Background: COVID-19 is an infection caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The first reported case happened in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. At present, at least 1.8 million people are infected around the world and almost 110,000 people have died. Many studies have analyzed the clinical picture of COVID-19, but they are focused on respiratory symptoms and headache is generically treated. Methods: I describe and discuss my headaches during my COVID-19 and I review the MEDLINE literature about headaches and COVID-19. Results: More than 41,000 COVID-19 patients have been included in clinical studies and headache was present in 8%-12% of them. However, no headache characterization was made in these studies. As a headache expert and based on my own personal clinical case, headaches related to COVID-19 can be classified in the 2 phases of the disease. Acute headache attributed to systemic viral infection, primary cough headache, tension-type headache and headache attributed to heterophoria can appear in the first phase (the influenza-like phase); and headache attributed to hypoxia and a new headache, difficult to fit into the ICHD3, can appear if the second phase (the cytokine storm phase) occurs. Conclusions: Several headaches can appear during COVID-19 infection. All of them are headaches specified in the ICHD3, except 1 that occurs from the 7th day after the clinical onset. This headache is probably related to the cytokine storm that some patients suffer and it could be framed under the ICHD3 headache of Headache attributed to other non-infectious inflammatory intracranial disease. Although the reported prevalence of headaches as a symptom of COVID-19 infection is low, this experience shows that, very probably, it is underestimated.",covid
"Background: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in the post-operative period is challenging. Its clinical manifestations may have similarities to other septic, thoracic, or gastrointestinal post-surgical complications. Additionally, the post-operative period may be a time of increased risk for severe manifestations of COVID-19. We sought to evaluate the frequency of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients who had recently had operations who were undergoing imaging for acute symptoms and the role of chest computed tomography (CT) in this setting. Patients and Methods: We included all patients who had chest CT for acute symptoms in the 15 days after a surgical procedure between March 1 and 31, 2020. Results: Of 46 patients with acute post-operative symptoms requiring chest imaging, eight (17%) were ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19. Among them, five (62%) required mechanical ventilation and two (25%) died. All had abnormal chest CT with typical findings of COVID-19 in 87%. Computed tomography provided an alternate diagnosis in 53% of patients who did not have COVID-19. The average time between a COVID-19-positive chest CT and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation was 1.2 days (range, 0-4 days). Conclusion: COVID-19 is a serious post-operative condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Chest CT provides prompt diagnosis of COVID-19. In centers with a high prevalence of COVID-19, chest acquisition should be included in CT scans done for acute post-operative symptoms.",covid
"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Since its detection in China at the end of 2019, the novel coronavirus has rapidly spread throughout the world and has caused an international public health emergency. The most common manifestation is flu-like symptoms. Mild infections usually improve within a few days, but COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Gastrointestinal symptoms are less common but possible and more difficult to recognize as part of a COVID-19 syndrome. In line with the current opinion of the WHO, we strongly believe that preventive measures and early diagnosis of COVID-19 are crucial to interrupt virus spread and avoid local outbreaks. We report the cases of COVID-19 patients admitted to our Emergency Department who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms at admission. Learning points: The novel COVID-19 infection is a severe public health problem which is causing an increasing number of deaths worldwide.Although uncommon, there may be a relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and COVID-19, as reported in recent studies.Early detection and isolation of patients with COVID-19 infection is the only way to control and limit the global spread of this virus.",covid

"Background: On 31 December 2019 an outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, was reported. The outbreak spread rapidly to other Chinese cities and multiple countries. This study described the spatio-temporal pattern and measured the spatial association of the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China from 16 January-06 February 2020. Methods: This study explored the spatial epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in mainland China. Moran's I spatial statistic with various definitions of neighbours was used to conduct a test to determine whether a spatial association of the COVID-19 infections existed. Results: The spatial spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in China was observed. The results showed that most of the models, except medical-care-based connection models, indicated a significant spatial association of COVID-19 infections from around 22 January 2020. Conclusions: Spatial analysis is of great help in understanding the spread of infectious diseases, and spatial association was the key to the spatial spread during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant challenges in the area of kidney donation and transplantation. The objective of this article is to establish general recommendations for surgical teams to manage the kidney transplant program duringthe COVID-19 era. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This document is based on the scientific evidence available on the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 and the experience of authors during the COVID-19 pandemic. A web and Pubmed search was performed using the keywords ""SARS-CoV-2"","" COVID-19"", ""COVID Urology"", ""COVID-19 surgery"", and ""kidney transplantation."" A modified nominal group technique was used. RESULTS: When health system saturation occurs, kidney transplants should be deferred, except in patients with low transplant possibilities and an optimal kidney available, combined transplants or life-threatening situations. Screening for the SARS-CoV-2 virus should be done in all those donors and recipients with clinical symptoms consistent with COVID-19, who have visited or live inhigh-risk areas, or who have been in close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19. Donation and transplantation will not proceed in confirmed cases of COVID-19. Surgeries should be based on general recommendations in the COVID-19 era and will be efficient, short, and focused on those with the shortest hospital stay. In emergencies, protective measures will be taken with persona lprotection equipment. Surgical staff will be only the strictly necessary, and permanence in the OR should be minimized. Transplant urology consultations will be conducted by teleconsultation when possible. CONCLUSION: The safety of potential donors and recipients must be guaranteed, adopting individual protection measures and screening for SARS-CoV-2. Kidney transplant surgery must be efficient in terms of health, human resources, and clinical benefit. All non-urgent transplant activities should be delayed until the improvement of the local condition of each center.",covid
"Children have shown more physical resilience to COVID-19 than adults, but there is a cohort of vulnerable infants and young children who may experience disease burden, both in the acute phase and chronically. Children may have had early undocumented exposure to COVID-19. Even when the risk of exposure was known, developmental variables may have made the avoidance of physical proximity difficult for children. Preliminary hypotheses concerning neurotropic factors have been documented by researchers. Children with COVID-19 and comorbid physical or mental disorders may be vulnerable to exacerbations of neurotropic factors and comorbidities, the neural impact of which has been documented for other coronaviruses. Researchers are investigating COVID-19 symptom descriptions, neurotropic mechanisms at the genomic and transcriptomatic levels, neurological manifestations, and the impact of comorbid health complications. Neuropsychologists need information concerning the likely impact of COVID-19 on children. With a view toward that goal, this article provides recommendations for some initial updates in neuropsychology practice.",covid
"Introduction: Lopinavir in combination with ritonavir is approved for the treatment of HIV and has recently been subject to a clinical trial in severe COVID-19. Areas covered: This evaluation is of LOTUS China (the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-Cov-2 in China), which was a randomized trial in hospitalized subjects with COVID-9 in a respiratory sample and pneumonia. As, in severe COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir had no beneficial effects but increased gastrointestinal adverse effects, this combination should not be used at this stage of COVID-19. Expert opinion: In my opinion, the rationale for undertaking a trial of lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 was poor. The analysis of a modified intention to treat group analysis in LOTUS China may have introduced bias. After LOTUS China, there is probably no future for lopinavir in the treatment of severe COVID-19, but some clinical trials for prevention or in various stages of COVID-19 have recently started or are ongoing. The major limitation of these trials is that as lopinavir does not inhibit COVID-19, it is unlikely to prevent infection, reduce viral load, or reduce the severity. However, these trials may be worthwhile in finally determining whether lopinavir has any role in preventing or treating COVID-19.",covid
"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had enormous health, economic, and social consequences. The clinical spectrum of cutaneous manifestations observed in patients with COVID-19 is both heterogeneous and complex. To date, reports have identified 5main categories: acral lesions, vesicular rashes, urticarial rashes, maculopapular rashes, and livedoid and necrotic lesions. However, these will probably be modified as new information comes to light. Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 probably reflect the activation of pathogenic pathways by the virus or a response to inflammatory processes, vascular or systemic complications, or even treatments. Familiarity with the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 may enable early diagnosis or help guide prognosis.",covid
"Introduction: Anosmia has not been formally recognised as a symptom of COVID-19 infection. Growing anecdotal evidence suggests increasing incidence of cases of anosmia during the current pandemic, suggesting that COVID-19 may cause olfactory dysfunction. The objective was to characterise patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODOLOGY: Design: Survey of 2428 patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Setting: Volunteer sample of patients seeking medical advice of recent onset self-diagnosed loss of sense of smell RESULTS: 2428 surveys were completed within 7 days; 64% respondents were under 40. The majority of respondents reported onset of their anosmia in the last week. Of the cohort, 17% did not report any other symptom thought to be associated with COVID-19. In patients who reported other symptoms, 51% reported either cough or fever and therefore met current guidelines for self-isolation. Conclusions: Anosmia is reported in conjunction with well-reported symptoms of coronas virus, but 1 in 6 patients with recent onset anosmia report this as an isolated symptom. This might help identify otherwise asymptomatic carriers of disease and trigger targeted testing. Further study with COVID-19 testing is required to identify the proportion of patients in whom new onset anosmia can be attributed to COVID-19.",covid
"Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic, resulting in large number of deaths all over the world. Lack of effective antiviral agents and vaccines pose a major challenge to control this pandemic. Methods: Review the role of reverse quarantine in the control of COVID-19. Results: Public health measures like social distancing, wearing face mask and hand hygiene along with quarantine measures form important steps to control the disease. Reverses quarantine is a useful strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. Conclusions: Reverse quarantine is a promising public health measure to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.",covid
"Background: Since the Covid-19 global pandemic emerged, developing countries have been facing multiple challenges over its diagnosis. We aimed to establish a relationship between the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 for early detection and assessment to reduce the transmission rate of SARS-Cov-2. Methods: We collected published data on the clinical features of Covid-19 retrospectively and categorized them into physical and blood biomarkers. Common features were assigned scores by the Borg scoring method with slight modifications and were incorporated into a newly-developed Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 assessment Chart. Correlations between signs and symptoms with the development of Covid-19 was assessed by Pearson correlation and Spearman Correlation coefficient (rho). Linear regression analysis was employed to assess the highest correlating features. The frequency of signs and symptoms in developing Covid-19 was assessed through Chi-square test two tailed with Cramer's V strength. Changes in signs and symptoms were incorporated into a chart that consisted of four tiers representing disease stages. Results: Data from 10,172 Covid-19 laboratory confirmed cases showed a correlation with Fever in 43.9% (P = 0.000) cases, cough 54.08% and dry mucus 25.68% equally significant (P = 0.000), Hyperemic pharyngeal mucus membrane 17.92% (P = 0.005), leukopenia 28.11% (P = 0.000), lymphopenia 64.35% (P = 0.000), thrombopenia 35.49% (P = 0.000), elevated Alanine aminotransferase 50.02% (P = 0.000), and Aspartate aminotransferase 34.49% (P = 0.000). The chart exhibited a maximum scoring of 39. Normal tier scoring was ≤ 12/39, mild state scoring was 13-22/39, and star values scoring was ≥7/15; this latter category on the chart means Covid-19 is progressing and quarantine should be adopted. Moderate stage scored 23-33 and severe scored 34-39 in the chart. Conclusion: The Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 Chart is significant in assessing subclinical and clinical stages of Covid-19 to reduce the transmission rate.",covid
"Introduction: COVID-19 is the disease caused by an infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) respiratory disease. World Health Organization (WHO) declared the official name as COVID-19 in February 2020 and in 11th March 2020 declared COVID-19 as Global Pandemic. In June 6th 2020, over 7 million cases registered in the world, recovered 3.4 million and death over 402.000. Aim: The aim of this study is to retreive published papers about COVID-19 infection deposited in PubMed data base and analyzed current results of investigations regarding morbidity and mortality rates as consequences of COVID-19 infection and opinions of experts about treatment of afected patients with COVID-19 who have Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Methods: It's used method of descriptive analysis of the published papers with described studies about Corona virus connected with CVDs. Results: After searching current scientific literature (on PubMed till today is deposited more than 1.000 papers about COVID-19 with consequences in almost every medical disciplines), we have acknowledged that till today not any Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) study in the world. Also, there are no unique proposed ways of treatments and drugs to protect patients, especially people over 65 years old, who are very risk group to be affected with COVID-19, including patients with CVDs. Vaccine against COVID-19 is already produced and being in phases of testing in praxis in treatment of COVID-19 at affected patients, but the opinions of experts and common people whole over the world about vaccination are full of controversis. Conclusion: Frequent hand washing, avoiding crowds and contact with sick people, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces can help prevent coronavirus infections are the main proposal of WHO experts in current Guidelines, artefacts stored on a web site. Those preventive measures at least can help to everybody, including also the patients who have evidenced CVDs in their histories of illness. Authors analyzed most important dilemmas about all aspects of CVDs, including etipathogenesis, treatment with current drugs and use of potential discovered vaccines against COVID-19 infection, described in scientific papers deposited in PubMed data base.",covid
"Background: COVID-19 epidemic rapidly spread all around the world with over 1500 thousand infected cases and 95000 deaths. This rapid pandemic may overwhelm health care capacity and shortage of resources is a major concern. Literature provided guidelines on management of COVID-19 patients but healthcare service to the normal population should be continued meanwhile. Health system should act immediately and wisely to support essential surgical care while fighting against COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search in the major data bases since 2020, using the combination of MeSH words of ""COVID-19 "" and ""surgery"" and finally 34 full texts entered to data extraction phase to define a plan for surgical practice during COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Healthcare workers are at the higher risk of contamination by COVID-19 especially in early stage of outbreak when they were not aware of the different aspects of COVID-19 pandemic. All healthcare staff must be trained to properly use PPE. All patients have to be screened at the hospital triage. All elective surgical interventions must be postponed. Operation room is considered as a place with high risk of cross infection so the highest level of protection should be maintained. Anesthesia, endoscopy and oral surgery are considered as aerosol producing procedures with very high risk of contamination. There is not any evidence to support the risk of infection trough blood products. Postoperative respiratory problems are more common among COVID-19 patients that may increases the estimated risk of morbidity and mortality. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic is a dynamic challenge for health system to save the healthcare staff and equipment resources by timely decisions. Healthcare workers are at the higher risk of contamination by COVID-19 especially in early phase of epidemic when the protection is sub-optimal.",covid
"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by many factors such as infections. CRS in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is life-threatening and can occur very rapidly after COVID-19 diagnosis. Tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor, may ameliorate the CRS associated with severe COVID-19 and thus improve clinical outcomes. We present a case of life-threatening CRS caused by COVID-19 infection successfully treated with TCZ. Learning points: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by COVID-19.CRS can be life-threatening in severe COVID-19.Tocilizumab may have a role in treating severe COVID-19 patients with CRS.",covid
"The outbreaks of COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 has caused serious physical and psychological damage to global human health. COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world in a short time. Confronted with such a highly infectious respiratory disease, the research and development of anti-COVID-19 drugs became an urgent work due to the lack of specific drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Nevertheless, several existing drugs are available to relieve the clinical symptoms of COVID-19. We reviewed information on selected anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidate therapeutic agents published until June 2, 2020. We also discussed the strategies of the development of anti-COVID-19 drugs in the future. Our review provides a novel insight into the future development of a safer, efficient, and toxic-less anti-COVID-19 drug.",covid
"Background and aims: The relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) and diabetes mellitus is bidirectional. On one hand, diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. On the other hand, new onset diabetes and severe metabolic complications of pre-existing diabetes, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have been observed in patients with COVID-19. In this report, we describe two patient with diabetes mellitus who presented to our hospital with DKA. We also reviewed almost all published cases of DKA that had been precipitated by COVID-19. Methods: Two patients were admitted with DKA, who were diagnosed to have COVID-19 on the basis of real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Detailed history, anthropometry, laboratory investigations, imaging studies, clinical course and management outcomes were documented. Results: First patient (30-year-male) had undiagnosed diabetes and no other comorbidities, and COVID-19 precipitated DKA. He also had COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Second patient (60-year-male) had long duration hypertension with no prior history of diabetes and developed cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was also diagnosed with COVID-19 (RT-PCR assay) and DKA in the hospital. CVA and COVID-19 could have precipitated DKA. Both patients responded well to treatment and were discharged in a stable condition. Conclusions: These cases show that COVID-19 can precipitate DKA in a significant number of patients. DKA can occur in patients with pre-existing diabetes or newly diagnosed diabetes. As COVID-19 and diabetes are prevalent conditions, high degree of suspicion is required to diagnose DKA timely in order to improve the prognosis of COVID-19-related diabetic ketoacidosis.",covid
"Coronavirus disease (also known as COVID-19) continues to spread throughout the world. In Turkey, which has a strong health system, most hospitals have been turned into pandemic hospitals, elective procedures have been postponed, and doctors have been reassigned to treat COVID-19. Efforts to limit spread of COVID-19 have been effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Behind this success was not only the intrinsic strength of the health system but also the strict changes in everyday life wrought by the crisis. It is an inescapable fact that these new measures, such as the imposition of curfew and lockdown, have had a significant effect on the mental health of the general population. Anxiety caused by COVID-19 has spread to the mental state of everyone. Although coronavirus-related diseases will end soon, it is predicted that serious psychiatric disorders will be a lasting consequence of the pandemic. Despite the many negatives brought by COVID-19, it has led to a positive unity between the public and healthcare professionals, and in spite of significant risks to their own health, healthcare workers have risen to the challenge of COVID-19.",covid
"Objective: To identify the taste and smell impairment in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive subjects and compare the findings with COVID-19-negative subjects using the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) Anosmia Reporting Tool. Setting: Tertiary referral center/COVID-19 pandemic hospital. Study design: Comparative study. Subjects and methods: After power analysis, 128 subjects were divided into 2 groups according to real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 testing results. Subjects were called via telephone, and the AAO-HNS Anosmia Reporting Tool was used to collect responses. Results: The mean age of the study group was 38.63 ± 10.08 years. At the time of sampling, rhinorrhea was significantly high in the COVID-19-negative group, whereas those complaints described as ""other"" were significantly high in the COVID-19-positive group. There was a significant difference in the smell/taste impairment rates of the groups (n = 46% [71.9%] for the COVID-19-positive group vs n = 17 [26.6%] for the COVID-19-negative group, P = .001). For subjects with a smell impairment, anosmia rates did not differ between the groups. The rates of hyposmia and parosmia were significantly high in the COVID-19-positive group. For the subjects with taste impairment, ageusia rates did not differ between groups. The rate of hypogeusia and dysgeusia was significantly high in the COVID-19-positive group. Logistic regression analysis indicates that smell/taste impairment in COVID-19-positive subjects increases the odds ratio by 6.956 (95% CI, 3.16-15.29) times. Conclusion: COVID-19-positive subjects are strongly associated with smell/taste impairment.",covid
"COVID-19, also called coronavirus, is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. First identified in December 2019, in March 2020 it was announced by the World Health Organisation that COVID-19 had become a global pandemic. The disease can affect different organ systems, and early reports have suggested skin symptoms. The researchers, working with dermatologists across Spain, reviewed 375 patients with suspected, or confirmed, COVID-19, with the aim of developing a detailed classification of the different types of skin symptoms associated with COVID-19 with corresponding images. An initial 120 images were reviewed by four dermatologists, without knowing any other clinical information, and they identified patterns of symptoms associated with COVID-19. These patterns were then applied to the rest of the images and further refined. Five common skin symptoms were identified this way. These symptoms are chilblain-like lesions, outbreaks of small blisters, wheals, rashes comprised of small flat and raised red bumps, and livedo and necrosis. Livedo is a skin condition where circulation is impaired within the blood vessels of the skin, necrosis refers to the premature death of skin tissue. These symptoms are associated with different severity of COVID-19 infection, from less severe disease in the chilblain-like lesions, to most severe in patients with livedo. The researchers noted that some of the skin symptoms associated with COVID-19 are common and can have many causes, particularly wheals and rashes. As such, they may not be particularly helpful as an aide to diagnosis.",covid
"Background: Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, it has affected >200 countries, areas, or territories in 6 continents. At present, whether COVID-19 has an effect on thyroid function is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate thyroid function in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography scans were retrospectively reviewed for 50 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 without a history of thyroid disease who underwent thyroid function testing during their course of COVID-19 infection and after recovery. They were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, between January and March 2020. Healthy participants who underwent routine physical checkups and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients with a similar degree of severity during the same period were included in the study as the control group. Thyroid hormone and thyrotropin (TSH) levels were analyzed and compared between the COVID-19 and control groups. Results: TSH lower than the normal range was present in 56% (28/50) of the patients with COVID-19. The levels of TSH and serum total triiodothyronine (TT3) of the patients with COVID-19 were significantly lower than those of the healthy control group and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The more severe the COVID-19, the lower the TSH and TT3 levels were, with statistical significance (p < 0.001). The degree of the decreases in TSH and TT3 levels was positively correlated with the severity of the disease. The total thyroxine (TT4) level of the patients with COVID-19 was not significantly different from the control group. All the patients did not receive thyroid hormone replacement therapy. After recovery, no significant differences in TSH, TT3, TT4, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4) levels were found between the COVID-19 and control groups. Conclusions: The changes in serum TSH and TT3 levels may be important manifestations of the courses of COVID-19.",covid
"COVID-19 is a severe infectious disease that has claimed >150,000 lives and infected millions in the United States thus far, especially the elderly population. Emerging evidence has shown the virus to cause hemorrhagic and immunologic responses, which impact all organs, including lungs, kidneys, and the brain, as well as extremities. SARS-CoV-2 also affects patients', families', and society's mental health at large. There is growing evidence of re-infection in some patients. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, its mechanism of infection, diagnostics, therapeutics, and treatment strategies, while also focusing on less attended aspects by previous studies, including nutritional support, psychological, and rehabilitation of the pandemic and its management. We performed a systematic review of >1,000 articles and included 425 references from online databases, including, PubMed, Google Scholar, and California Baptist University's library. COVID-19 patients go through acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm, acute hypercoagulable state, and autonomic dysfunction, which must be managed by a multidisciplinary team including nursing, nutrition, and rehabilitation. The elderly population and those who are suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia related illnesses seem to be at the higher risk. There are 28 vaccines under development, and new treatment strategies/protocols are being investigated. The future management for COVID-19 should include B-cell and T-cell immunotherapy in combination with emerging prophylaxis. The mental health and illness aspect of COVID-19 are among the most important side effects of this pandemic which requires a national plan for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.",covid
"The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While much of the focus has been on the cardiac and pulmonary complications, there are several important dermatologic components that clinicians must be aware of. Objective: This brief report summarizes the dermatologic manifestations and complications associated with COVID-19 with an emphasis on Emergency Medicine clinicians. Discussion: Dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19 are increasingly recognized within the literature. The primary etiologies include vasculitis versus direct viral involvement. There are several types of skin findings described in association with COVID-19. These include maculopapular rashes, urticaria, vesicles, petechiae, purpura, chilblains, livedo racemosa, and distal limb ischemia. While most of these dermatologic findings are self-resolving, they can help increase one's suspicion for COVID-19. Conclusion: It is important to be aware of the dermatologic manifestations and complications of COVID-19. Knowledge of the components is important to help identify potential COVID-19 patients and properly treat complications.",covid
"Background: The effect of HIV co-infection on COVID-19 outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown. Methods: We conducted a population cohort study using linked data from adults attending public sector health facilities in the Western Cape, South Africa. We used Cox-proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, location and comorbidities to examine the association between HIV and COVID-19 death among (i) public sector 'active patients' (at least 1 health visit in the 3 years before March 2020), (ii) laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases and (iii) hospitalized COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. We calculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for COVID-19 comparing HIV positive vs. negative adults using modelled population estimates. Results: Among 3,460,932 public sector patients (16% HIV positive), 22,308 were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 625 died. In adjusted analysis, HIV increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]:2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.70; 2.70), with similar risks across strata of viral load and immunosuppression. increased HIV-associated risk of COVID-19 death remained when restricting to COVID-19 cases (aHR:1.70; 95%CI:132; 2.18) or hospitalized cases (aHR:1.45; 95%CI:1.14; 1.84). Current and previous tuberculosis also increased COVID-19 mortality risk (aHR [95%CI]:2.70 [1.81; 4.04] and 1.51 [1.18; 1.93] respectively). The SMR for COVID-19 death associated with HIV was 2.39 (95% CI:1.96; 2.86); population attributable fraction 8.5% (95%CI:6.1; 11.1). Conclusion: HIV was associated with a doubling of COVID-19 mortality risk. While our findings may over-estimate the HIV-associated risk COVID-19 death due to residual confounding, people with HIV should be considered a high-risk group for COVID-19 management.",covid
"COVID-19 is continuing as a big challenge for the globe and several types of research are continued to find safe and effective treatment and preventive options. Although there is a lack of conclusive evidence of their benefit, there is worldwide controversy to use anti-malarial drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, for the treatment of COVID-19. FDA issued an emergency use authorization to the use of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. On the contrary to the FDA, the European Medicines Agency has warned against the widespread use of these drugs to treat COVID-19. Finally, the WHO declared that clinical trials on these drugs are halted after the devastating findings of the study published in the medical journal called The Lancet. Against this fact, there are several rumors about the irresponsible use of these drugs in Africa for the treatment of COVID-19. This work aimed to review the off-label use of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 in African countries against WHO recommendation. Data on the use of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 in African countries were searched from credible sources including Scopus, PubMed, Hindawi, Google Scholar, and from local and international media. The study showed that many African countries have already approved at the national level to use these drugs to treat COVID-19 by opposing WHO warnings. In addition to this, falsified and substandard chloroquine products started to emerge in some African countries. The health sectors of the African government should critically compare the risks and benefits before using these drugs. The WHO and African drug regulatory organizations should intervene to stop the off-label use practice of these drugs against the licensed purpose and distribution of falsified and substandard products in the continent.",covid
"A series of epidemiological explorations have suggested a negative association between national BCG vaccination policy and the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. Nevertheless, these comparisons are difficult to validate due to broad differences between countries such as socioeconomic status, demographic structure, rural vs. urban settings, time of arrival of the pandemic, number of diagnostic tests and criteria for testing, and national control strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. We review evidence for the potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density and age structure). Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no-association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19. Public health implications of a plausible BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 are discussed.",covid
"Objective: To determine the association between smoking and progression of COVID-19. Design: A meta-analysis of 12 published papers. Data source: PubMed database was searched on April 6, 2020. Eligibility criteria and data analysis: We included studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease. Search terms included smoking, smoker*, characteristics, risk factors, outcomes, and COVID-19, COVID, coronavirus, sar cov-2, sar cov 2. There were no language limitations. One author extracted information for each study, screened the abstract or the full text, with questions resolved through discussion among both authors. A random effects meta-analysis was applied. Main outcome measures: The study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people who already had the disease. Results: We identified 12 papers with a total of 9,025 COVID-19 patients, 878 (9.7%) with severe disease and 495 with a history of smoking (5.5%). The meta-analysis showed a significant association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.49-3.39, p=0.001). Limitations in the 12 papers suggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher. Conclusions: Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers. Physicians and public health professionals should collect data on smoking as part of clinical management and add smoking cessation to the list of practices to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid

"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus COVID-19 a pandemic. There are patients in psychiatric hospitals in China who have been infected with COVID-19, however, the knowledge and attitudes of psychiatric hospital staff towards infectious diseases and their willingness to work during the COVID-19 outbreak has not yet been investigated. This study was performed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in two Chinese mental health centers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We included 141 psychiatrists and 170 psychiatric nurses in the study. We found that during the COVID-19 epidemic, 89.51% of the medical staff of the psychiatric hospitals studied had extensive knowledge of COVID-19, and 64.63% of them received the relevant training in hospitals. Furthermore, about 77.17% of participants expressed a willingness to care for psychiatric patients suffering from COVID-19 virus infection. Independent predictors of willingness to care for patients included advanced training and experience of caring for patients with COVID-19. In conclusion, this study suggests that increased attention should be paid to the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff at psychiatric hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak.",covid
"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19, a novel coronavirus infection, as a pandemic in March 2020. Since the origin of the disease in Wuhan, China, understanding the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, screening guidelines, and management of the disease has been ever-evolving. Though respiratory pathologies have been the major complications of a COVID-19 infection, other presentations like abdominal pain, deep venous thrombosis, cardiomyopathy, and even acute cerebrovascular ischemic attacks have been reported. We present a case of a young patient presenting with vertigo, possibly from COVID-19-induced acute vestibular neuritis. This is a 20-year-old Hispanic female patient presenting with intractable vertigo, nausea, and vomiting but without any typical symptoms like fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Initial examination and imaging ruled out an acute stroke. There was minimal improvement in her vestibular symptoms with the recommended COVID-19 treatment as of March 2020 (hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin) and symptomatic management. Her inflammatory markers were surprisingly normal all through the hospital course. She was then treated with oral prednisone and subsequently discharged home after a prolonged course of eight days. The pathophysiology of COVID-19-induced vestibular neuritis could be similar to any other viral infection. Clinicians should consider COVID-19 in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with similar symptoms, especially in areas of a high prevalence of this disease. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 in such cases is important for proper isolation, to minimize exposure and avoid further unnecessary investigations. These symptoms will just resolve with symptomatic management like any other case of vestibular neuritis without any further management that is specific for a COVID-19 infection.",covid
"Objective: To explore the management strategies for patients with gynecological malignant tumors during the outbreak and transmission of COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, treatment, and disease outcomes of three patients with gynecological malignancies associated with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, and proposed management strategies for patients with gynecological tumors underriskof COVID-19. Results: Based on the national diagnosis and treatment protocol as well as research progress for COVID-19, three patients with COVID-19 were treated. Meanwhile, they were also appropriately adjusted the treatment plan in accordance with the clinical guidelines for gynecological tumors. Pneumonia was cured in 2 patients, and one patient died of COVID-19. Conclusions: Patients with gynecological malignant tumors are high-risk groups prone to COVID-19, and gynecological oncologists need to carry out education, prevention, control and treatment according to specific conditions. While, actively preventing and controlling COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment of gynecological malignant tumors should be carried out in an orderly and safe manner.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a current global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Alongside its potential to cause severe respiratory illness, studies have reported a distinct COVID-19-associated coagulopathy that is characterized by elevated D-dimer levels, hyperfibrinogenemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and slight prolongation of the prothrombin time. Studies have also reported increased rates of thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19, but variations in study methodologies, patient populations, and anticoagulation strategies make it challenging to distill implications for clinical practice. Here, we present a practical review of current literature and uses a case-based format to discuss the diagnostic approach and management of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated coagulopathy is characterized by elevated D-dimer levels, hyperfibrinogenemia, and increased rates of thromboembolism. Current management guidelines are based on limited evidence from retrospective studies that should be interpreted carefully. At this time, all hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should receive coagulation test surveillance and standard doses of prophylactic anticoagulation until prospective randomized controlled trials yield definitive information in support of higher prophylactic doses.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic, after it was reported in December 2019, is a highly contagious and now spreading to over 190 countries, causing a severe public health burden. Currently, there is no vaccine or specific drug to treat COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-2-CoV. For this emergency, the FDA has approved Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 as Emergency Use Authorization. However, even after this pandemic, COVID-19 may still have a chance to come back. Therefore, we need to come out with new strategies for drug discovery for combating COVID-19 in the future.",covid
"Objective: Olfactory and taste dysfunction (OTD) is a potential neurological manifestation of coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia for COVID-19. Methods: A comprehensive electronic search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar from 1 June 2020 to 12 June 2020. All studies reporting symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19-positive patients were included. A total of 23 studies were included in the systematic review. Results: Symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia were frequently reported by COVID-19-positive patients. Symptoms were more common in females and in younger patients. There was no direct association between the severity of COVID-19 and the presence of symptoms. However, some evidence was found for a longer duration of these symptoms and increased severity of COVID-19 infection in young patients. Conclusion: OTD is commonly reported by COVID-19 patients. Due to limited literature on the association between OTD and COVID-19, it is currently not possible to conclude that these symptoms alone can be used to diagnose COVID-19. However, the presence of OTD can potentially be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 especially in young and female patients. Further research is required to establish the true diagnostic value of these symptoms and efficacy as screening tools for COVID-19 patients.",covid
"Given the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the huge negative impacts it is causing, researching on COVID-19-related issues is very important for designing proactive and comprehensive public health interventions to fight against the pandemic. We describe the characteristics of COVID-19 patients detected in the two phases of the epidemic in Vietnam. Data used in this paper were mainly obtained from the official database of the Ministry of Health of Vietnam. Descriptive statistics were carried out using Stata 16 software. As of 18 May 2020, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases detected in Vietnam was 324, 16 cases from 4 cities and provinces in the first phase (during 20 days, 0.8 cases detected per day) and 308 cases from 35 cities, provinces in the second phase (during 76 days, 4.1 cases detected per day). Vietnam has mobilized its entire political system to fight the COVID-19 and achieved some initial successes. We found both similarities and differences between the two phases of the COVID-19 epidemic in Vietnam. We demonstrated that the situation of the COVID-19 epidemic in Vietnam is getting more complicated and unpredictable.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health emergency in 2020. Patients with COVID-19 may present with variable clinical features, involving pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular symptoms. Notwithstanding, the acute abdomen as a presentation of COVID-19 is rare. We report an adolescent with confirmed COVID-19, initially presented with acute abdominal pain mimicking appendicitis. Our case highlights the inaccuracy of using clinical diagnosis for surgical abdomen in the COVID-19 era. Clinicians should perform screening COVID-19 tests in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain before admitting the patients to implement proper preventive measures in order to reduce viral transmission to other patients and healthcare professionals. Confirmed COVID-19 patients with acute abdomen may need proper imaging tests before surgery to avoid iatrogenic complications.",covid
"Geriatric patients seem to be the most vulnerable group in COVID-19. These patients are usually characterized by impaired mobilization and malnutrition. In addition, obesity has been correlated with increased mortality rates after COVID-19 infection, highlighting the role of nutrition in prognosis of COVID-19 as well. In the past, several indices of nutritional status (GNRI) and functional status (ECOG performance status, Barthel Index, Handgrip Strength) have demonstrated a prognostic ability for hospitalized patients with influenza-like respiratory infections from coronavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza and rhinovirus. Our hypothesis suggests that the previously mentioned nutritional and functional status indices, combined with the pneumonia severity index (CRB-65), could be useful in prognosis of morbidity and mortality of the elderly after the novel COVID-19 infection. Our hypothesis, is the first in the literature, which suggests a prognostic association between nutritional status of patients and COVID-19 infection, offering a quick and low-cost prognostic tool for COVID-19 in the elderly.",covid
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment in China. Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is shown to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China. The drug is recommended to be included in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19 infection in larger populations in the future.",covid
"Since its origin in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a pandemic and spread to 209 countries. As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a very rapidly emerging disease, organ-specific studies related to it have been reported. Apart from respiratory findings, some studies have highlighted inflammatory consequences in the heart, kidney, and/or liver as well. Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 seems to be a result of an inflammatory storm in response to the infection. Moreover, direct viral invasion of cardiomyocytes, as well as a myocardial injury due to oxidative stress, may account for acute cardiac injury in COVID-19. Nevertheless, the mechanism of heart injury in COVID-19 is not clear yet. However, multiple studies that highlight the clinical features, laboratory findings, and prognosis of acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19-affected individuals have been published. In this review, we have summarized the findings of all those studies as well as the clinical features and management of cardiac injury discussed by some case reports.",covid
"COVID-19 is continuing as a big challenge for the globe and several types of research are continued to find safe and effective treatment and preventive options. Although there is a lack of conclusive evidence of their benefit, there is worldwide controversy to use anti-malarial drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, for the treatment of COVID-19. FDA issued an emergency use authorization to the use of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. On the contrary to the FDA, the European Medicines Agency has warned against the widespread use of these drugs to treat COVID-19. Finally, the WHO declared that clinical trials on these drugs are halted after the devastating findings of the study published in the medical journal called The Lancet. Against this fact, there are several rumors about the irresponsible use of these drugs in Africa for the treatment of COVID-19. This work aimed to review the off-label use of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 in African countries against WHO recommendation. Data on the use of these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 in African countries were searched from credible sources including Scopus, PubMed, Hindawi, Google Scholar, and from local and international media. The study showed that many African countries have already approved at the national level to use these drugs to treat COVID-19 by opposing WHO warnings. In addition to this, falsified and substandard chloroquine products started to emerge in some African countries. The health sectors of the African government should critically compare the risks and benefits before using these drugs. The WHO and African drug regulatory organizations should intervene to stop the off-label use practice of these drugs against the licensed purpose and distribution of falsified and substandard products in the continent.",covid
"Background and aims: As, the COVID-19 has been deemed a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO), and since it spreads everywhere throughout the world, investigation in relation to this disease is very much essential. Investigation of pattern in the occurrence of COVID-19, to check the influence of different meteorological factors on the incidence of COVID-19 and prediction of incidence of COVID-19 are the objectives of this paper. Methods: For trend analysis, Sen's Slope and Man-Kendall test have been used, Generalized Additive Model (GAM) of regression has been used to check the influence of different meteorological factors on the incidence and to predict the frequency of COVID-19, and Verhulst (Logistic) Population Model has been used. Results: Statistically significant linear trend found for the daily-confirmed cases of COVID-19. The regression analysis indicates that there is some influence of the interaction of average temperature (AT) and average relative humidity (ARH) on the incidence of COVID-19. However, this result is not consistent throughout the study area. The projections have been made up to 21st May, 2020. Conclusions: Trend and regression analysis give an idea of the incidence of COVID-19 in India while projection made by Verhulst (Logistic) Population Model for the confirmed cases of the study area are encouraging as the sample prediction is as same as the actual number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.",covid
"Evidence from the global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has clearly demonstrated that individuals with pre-existing comorbidities are at a much greater risk of dying from COVID-19. This is of great concern for individuals living with these conditions, and a major challenge for global healthcare systems and biomedical research. Not all comorbidities confer the same risk, however, many affect the function of the immune system, which in turn directly impacts the response to COVID-19. Furthermore, the myriad of drugs prescribed for these comorbidities can also influence the progression of COVID-19 and limit additional treatment options available for COVID-19. Here, we review immune dysfunction in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of pre-existing comorbidities on the development of COVID-19. We explore how underlying disease etiologies and common therapies used to treat these conditions exacerbate COVID-19 progression. Moreover, we discuss the long-term challenges associated with the use of both novel and repurposed therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing comorbidities.",covid
"Background: The acute respiratory illness designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and caused a worldwide pandemic. Concerns arose about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood donations and potential significant blood transfusion needs in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Data on blood usage in hospitalized COVID-19 patients are scarce. Study design and methods: We performed a retrospective observational study of blood component transfusions in the first 4 weeks of COVID-19 ward admissions. The study period began 14 days before the first COVID-19 cohort wards opened in our hospital in March 2020 and ended 28 days afterward. The number of patients and blood components transfused in the COVID-19 wards was tabulated. Transfusion rates of each blood component were compared in COVID-19 wards versus all other inpatient wards. Results: COVID-19 wards opened with seven suspected patients and after 4 weeks had 305 cumulative COVID-19 admissions. Forty-one of 305 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (13.4%) received transfusions with 11.1% receiving red blood cells (RBCs), 1.6% platelets (PLTs), 1.0% plasma, and 1.0% cryoprecipitate (cryo). COVID-19 wards had significantly lower transfusion rates compared to non-COVID wards for RBCs (0.03 vs 0.08 units/patient-day), PLTs (0.003 vs 0.033), and plasma (0.002 vs 0.018; all p < 0.0001). Cryo rates were similar (0.008 vs 0.009, p = 0.6). Conclusions: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients required many fewer blood transfusions than other hospitalized patients. COVID-19 transfusion data will inform planning and preparation of blood resource utilization during the pandemic.",covid
"Purpose: Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) mortality is higher in patients with cancer than in the general population, yet the cancer-associated risk factors for COVID-19 adverse outcomes are not fully characterized. Patients and methods: We reviewed clinical characteristics and outcomes from patients with cancer and concurrent COVID-19 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center until March 31, 2020 (n = 309), and observed clinical end points until April 13, 2020. We hypothesized that cytotoxic chemotherapy administered within 35 days of a COVID-19 diagnosis is associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of severe or critical COVID-19. In secondary analyses, we estimated associations between specific clinical and laboratory variables and the incidence of a severe or critical COVID-19 event. Results: Cytotoxic chemotherapy administration was not significantly associated with a severe or critical COVID-19 event (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.60). Hematologic malignancy was associated with increased COVID-19 severity (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.80). Patients with lung cancer also demonstrated higher rates of severe or critical COVID-19 events (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.20 to 3.30). Lymphopenia at COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with higher rates of severe or critical illness (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.50 to 3.10). Patients with baseline neutropenia 14-90 days before COVID-19 diagnosis had worse outcomes (HR, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.70 to 11.00). Findings from these analyses remained consistent in a multivariable model and in multiple sensitivity analyses. The rate of adverse events was lower in a time-matched population of patients with cancer without COVID-19. Conclusion: Recent cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment was not associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Patients with active hematologic or lung malignancies, peri-COVID-19 lymphopenia, or baseline neutropenia had worse COVID-19 outcomes. Interactions among antineoplastic therapy, cancer type, and COVID-19 are complex and warrant further investigation.",covid
"Background and aims: The COVID-19 spreads rapidly around the world which has brought a global health crisis. The pathogen of COVID-19 is SARS-COV-2, and previous studies have proposed the relationship between ABO blood group and coronavirus. Here, we aim to delve into the association between ABO blood group and COVID-19 infection, severity and demise. Methods: The relevant studies were retrieved from five databases: PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv,Web of Science and CNKI. Members of cases(symptomatic cases, severe cases, died cases) and controls(asymptomatic controls, non-severe controls, alive controls) were extracted from collected studies. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and interpreted from extracted data. Publication bias and sensitivity analysis were also applied to confirm our discovery. Results: Overall 31,100 samples were included in the analysis. Compared to other ABO blood type, an increased odds of infecting COVID-19 among individuals with A blood group (OR: 1.249, 95%CI: 1.114-1.440, P < 0.001) and a decreased odds of infecting COVID-19 among individuals with blood group O (OR: 0.699, 95%CI: 0.635-0.770, P < 0.001) were found. Besides, individuals with blood group AB seems to link a higher risk to COVID-19 severity (OR: 2.424, 95%CI: 0.934-6.294) and demise (OR: 1.348, 95%CI: 0.507-3.583). Meantime, individuals with O blood group might had lower risk to COVID-19 severity (OR: 0.748, 95%CI: 0.556-1.007), and individuals with B blood group were likely to relate a lower risk to COVID-19 demise. Conclusions: The current meta-analysis suggest that blood type A might be more susceptible to infect COVID-19 while blood type O might be less susceptible to infect COVID-19; there were no correlation between ABO blood group and severity or demise of COVID-19. However, more investigation and research are warranted to clarify the relationship between COVID-19 and ABO blood type.",covid
"Objective: The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. Studies from China, where the virus first spread, have reported increased psychological strain in healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychosocial burden of physicians and nurses depending on their degree of contact with COVID-19 patients. In addition, we explored which supportive resources they used and which supportive needs they experienced during the crisis. Methods: Data were collected between March and April 2020 at the University Hospital Augsburg. A total of 75 nurses and 35 physicians, working either in a special COVID-19 ward or in a regular ward, took part in the survey. The participants filled in two standardized questionnaires (the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ; and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, MBI), and reported their fear of a COVID-19 infection and stress at work on a 10-point Likert scale. Finally, they answered three open-ended questions about causes of burden, supportive resources and needs during the crisis. Results: Nurses working in the COVID-19 wards reported higher levels of stress, exhaustion, and depressive mood, as well as lower levels of work-related fulfilment compared to their colleagues in the regular wards. Physicians reported similar scores independent of their contact with COVID-19 patients. The most common causes for burden were job strain and uncertainty about the future. Psychosocial support as well as leisure time were listed as important resources, and a better infrastructure adjustment to COVID-19 at the hospital (e.g. sufficient staff, keeping teams and working schedules stable) as suggestion for improvement. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that especially nurses working in COVID-19 wards are affected psychologically by the consequences of the pandemic. This might be due to a higher workload and longer time in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, compared to physicians.",covid
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S., which leads globally in total cases and deaths. As COVID-19 vaccines are under development, public health officials and policymakers need to create strategic vaccine-acceptance messaging to effectively control the pandemic and prevent thousands of additional deaths. Methods: Using an online platform, we surveyed the U.S. adult population in May 2020 to understand risk perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic, acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, and trust in sources of information. These factors were compared across basic demographics. Findings: Of the 672 participants surveyed, 450 (67%) said they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it is recommended for them. Males (72%) compared to females, older adults (≥55 years; 78%) compared to younger adults, Asians (81%) compared to other racial and ethnic groups, and college and/or graduate degree holders (75%) compared to people with less than a college degree were more likely to accept the vaccine. When comparing reported influenza vaccine uptake to reported acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine: 1) participants who did not complete high school had a very low influenza vaccine uptake (10%), while 60% of the same group said they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine; 2) unemployed participants reported lower influenza uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance when compared to those employed or retired; and, 3) Black Americans reported lower influenza vaccine uptake and lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance than all other racial groups reported in our study. Lastly, we identified geographic differences with Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regions 2 (New York) and 5 (Chicago) reporting less than 50 percent COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Interpretation: Although our study found a 67% acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine, there were noticeable demographic and geographical disparities in vaccine acceptance. Before a COVID-19 vaccine is introduced to the U.S., public health officials and policymakers must prioritize effective COVID-19 vaccine-acceptance messaging for all Americans, especially those who are most vulnerable.",covid

"Background: Despite possibly higher risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 among people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), there has been limited reporting of COVID-19 trends for this population. Objective: To compare COVID-19 trends among people with and without IDD, overall and stratified by age. Methods: Data from the TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network platform was used to identify COVID-19 patients. Analysis focused on trends in comorbidities, number of cases, number of deaths, and case-fatality rate among patients with and without IDD who had a positive diagnosis for COVID-19 through May 14, 2020. Results: People with IDD had higher prevalence of specific comorbidities associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes. Distinct age-related differences in COVID-19 trends were present among those with IDD, with a higher concentration of COVID-19 cases at younger ages. In addition, while the overall case-fatality rate was similar for those with IDD (5.1%) and without IDD (5.4%), these rates differed by age: ages ≤17 - IDD 1.6%, without IDD <0.01%; ages 18-74 - IDD 4.5%, without IDD 2.7%; ages ≥75- IDD 21.1%, without IDD, 20.7%. Conclusions: Though of concern for all individuals, COVID-19 appears to present a greater risk to people with IDD, especially at younger ages. Future research should seek to document COVID-19 trends among people with IDD, with particular attention to age related trends.",covid

"Background: In the vast majority of the laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, computed tomography (CT) examinations yield a typical pattern and the sensitivity of this modality has been reported to be 97% in a large-scale study. Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. Purpose: To compose a comprehensive lexicon for description of the imaging findings and propose a grading system and structured reporting format for CT findings in COVID-19. Material and methods: We updated our published systematic review on imaging findings in COVID-19 to include 37 published studies pertaining to diagnostic features of COVID-19 in chest CT. Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT. Subsequently, we extracted a list of descriptive terms and mapped it to the terminology that is commonly used in imaging literature. Results: We composed a comprehensive lexicon that can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical CT imaging findings in COVID-19 patients. Using the same data, we propose a grading system with five COVID-RADS categories. Each COVID-RADS grade corresponds to a low, moderate, or high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19. Conclusion: The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients. Key points: • Chest CT has high sensitivity in diagnosing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). • Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. • The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.",covid

"Importance: Vitamin D treatment has been found to decrease the incidence of viral respiratory tract infection, especially in patients with vitamin D deficiency. Whether vitamin D is associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence is unknown. Objective: To examine whether the last vitamin D status before COVID-19 testing is associated with COVID-19 test results. Design, setting, and participants: This retrospective cohort study at an urban academic medical center included patients with a 25-hydroxycholecalciferol or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol level measured within 1 year before being tested for COVID-19 from March 3 to April 10, 2020. Exposures: Vitamin D deficiency was defined by the last measurement of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol less than 20 ng/mL or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol less than 18 pg/mL before COVID-19 testing. Treatment changes were defined by changes in vitamin D type and dose between the date of the last vitamin D level measurement and the date of COVID-19 testing. Vitamin D deficiency and treatment changes were combined to categorize the most recent vitamin D status before COVID-19 testing as likely deficient (last level deficient and treatment not increased), likely sufficient (last level not deficient and treatment not decreased), and 2 groups with uncertain deficiency (last level deficient and treatment increased, and last level not deficient and treatment decreased). Main outcomes and measures: The outcome was a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test result. Multivariable analysis tested whether vitamin D status before COVID-19 testing was associated with testing positive for COVID-19, controlling for demographic and comorbidity indicators. Results: A total of 489 patients (mean [SD] age, 49.2 [18.4] years; 366 [75%] women; and 331 [68%] race other than White) had a vitamin D level measured in the year before COVID-19 testing. Vitamin D status before COVID-19 testing was categorized as likely deficient for 124 participants (25%), likely sufficient for 287 (59%), and uncertain for 78 (16%). Overall, 71 participants (15%) tested positive for COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, testing positive for COVID-19 was associated with increasing age up to age 50 years (relative risk, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09; P = .02); non-White race (relative risk, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.26-5.12; P = .009), and likely deficient vitamin D status (relative risk, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.12-2.81; P = .02) compared with likely sufficient vitamin D status. Predicted COVID-19 rates in the deficient group were 21.6% (95% CI, 14.0%-29.2%) vs 12.2%(95% CI, 8.9%-15.4%) in the sufficient group. Conclusions and relevance: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, likely deficient vitamin D status was associated with increased COVID-19 risk, a finding that suggests that randomized trials may be needed to determine whether vitamin D affects COVID-19 risk.",covid
"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed stress on the health and well-being of both Chinese people and the public worldwide. Global public interest in this new issue largely reflects people's attention to COVID-19 and their willingness to take precautionary actions. This study aimed to examine global public awareness of COVID-19 using Google Trends. Methods: Using Google Trends, we retrieved public query data for terms of ""2019-nCoV + SARS-CoV-2 + novel coronavirus + new coronavirus + COVID-19 + Corona Virus Disease 2019"" between the 31st December 2019 and the 24th February 2020 in six major English-speaking countries, including the USA, the UK, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Dynamic series analysis demonstrates the overall change trend of relative search volume (RSV) for the topic on COVID-19. We compared the top-ranking related queries and sub-regions distribution of RSV about COVID-19 across different countries. The correlation between daily search volumes on the topic related to COVID-19 and the daily number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed. Results: The overall search trend of RSV regarding COVID-19 increased during the early period of observing time and reached the first apex on 31st January 2020. A shorter response time and a longer duration of public attention to COVID-19 was observed in public from the USA, the UK, Australia, and Canada, than that in Ireland and New Zealand. A slightly positive correlation between daily RSV about COVID-19 and the daily number of confirmed cases was observed (P < 0.05). People across countries presented a various interest to the RSV on COVID-19, and public awareness of COVID-19 was different in various sub-regions within countries. Conclusions: The results suggest that public response time to COVID-19 was different across countries, and the overall duration of public attention was short. The current study reminds us that governments should strengthen the publicity of COVID-19 nationally, strengthen the public's vigilance and sensitivity to COVID-19, inform public the importance of protecting themselves with enough precautionary measures, and finally control the spread of COVID-19 globally.",covid
"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), previously called 2019-nCoV, is a novel disease caused by SARS- CoV-2 which was first identified as outbreak of unknown respiratory illness in Wuhan, China. COVID- 19 was declared as global health emergency by WHO on March 11, 2020 and quickly elevated to global pandemic on 11 March 2020. COVID-19 symptom is highly various in each patient, with fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, and cough as the main presenting symptoms. Patient with COVID-19 may shows severe symptom with severe pneumonia and ARDS, mild symptom resembling simple upper respiration tract infection, or even completely asymptomatic. Approximately 80% of cases is mild. However the number may changes as more people are getting tested. Some experts are estimating that up to 50% of all cases may be asymptomatic carrier.",covid
"Objective: To identify the biomarkers as early warning signals for severe COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 63 patients with COVID- 19 from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, including 32 moderate cases and 31 severe cases. The demographic data, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations and laboratory test results were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that predicted the severity of COVID-19. The receiver- operating characteristic curve (ROC) of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was determined to estimate the optimal threshold of NLR for predicting severe cases of COVID-19. Results: The patients with moderate and server COVID-19 showed significant differences in the rate of diabetes, NLR, serum amyloid A (SSA), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum albumin (ALB) levels (P < 0.05). The co- morbidity of diabetes, NLR, SSA and CRP were found to positively correlate and ALB to inversely correlate with the severity of COVID-19 (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that NLR was an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 (OR=1.264, 95% CI: 1.046-1.526, P=0.015) with an AUC of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.730-0.932), an optimal diagnostic threshold of 4.795, a sensitivity of 0.839, and a specificity of 0.750. Conclusions: An increased NLR can serve as an early warning signal of severe COVID-19.",covid
"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), originally, from Wuhan, China, has now spread to most countries across the globe and devastated global healthcare systems. The impact of this disease has, however, shown baffling variations in prevalence in different regions of the world. The aim of this short review is to identify differential national COVID-19 prevalence of COVID-19, as well as to suggest these epidemiological differences. Methods A review of studies was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. Search tactics were centered on COVID-19 (""COVID-19"" AND ""coronavirus"") and BCG vaccination (""BCG vaccination"" OR ""Bacillus Calmette-Guérin"" OR ""vaccine"") Results It is found that national prevalence differences may be linked with BCG childhood immunization history. A statistically insignificant difference was observed in COVID-19 prevalence when comparing countries with a BGC policy and countries without it (P> 0.05). This inconclusivity suggests the influence of confounders in this study. Conclusions National differences in COVID-19 cases can be attributable to immunologic regulations, such as BCG vaccination protocols. Caution should be taken in establishing a correlation between COVID-19 prevalence and BCG vaccination, partly due to the weak quality of statistical data on COVID-19 related to poor testing rates in countries with BCG vaccination policy. Nonetheless, the analysis of the epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 will shed light on future efforts towards effective control and prevention.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new emerging pandemic, which has so far infected more than 20 million people throughout the world. Typically, this infection is transmitted from humans to humans via respiratory contact. However, the possibility that COVID-19 might be transmitted via atypical modes of transmission is an important public health consideration. In this short review article, the author summarizes and discusses the data on atypical modes of COVID-19 transmission. Based on the available data, it seems that there is still no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted via atypical modes of transmission.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a major shift in how breast services are being utilised and managed. The guidelines relating to this have been published by recognised medical associations from the UK, Europe and the USA, addressing many aspects of breast cancer care. There is an awareness that there may be limitations in resources during this time, and therefore, prioritisation strategies have been identified to ensure that breast cancer patients are appropriately treated, whilst reducing the risk of infection from COVID-19 to both patients and staff. Equally important is the consideration of how breast cancer services can be safely re-introduced, as infection rates from COVID-19 decline. However, until there is a definite management strategy for COVID-19, such as a vaccine being developed, it is likely that there will still be a significant impact from COVID-19 on breast cancer care. This paper, therefore, aims to highlight the current guidance and evidence regarding breast cancer management in the era of COVID-19, and also aims to look at future management strategies in this period of uncertainty.",covid
"Background and objective: COVID-19 is a highly contagious viral disease. In this study, we tried to define and discuss all the findings on the potential association between arachidonic acid (AA) pathway and COVID-19 pathophysiology. Methods: A literature search across PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane database was conducted. A total of 25 studies were identified. Results: The data elucidated that COX-2 and prostaglandins (PGs), particularly PGE2, have pro-inflammatory action in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Arachidonic acid can act as endogenous antiviral compound. A deficiency in AA can make humans more susceptible to COVID-19. Targeting these pro-inflammatory mediators may help in decreasing the mortality and morbidity rate in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: PGE2 levels and other PGs levels should be measured in patients with COVID-19. Lowering the PGE2 levels through inhibition of human microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) can enhance the host immune response against COVID-19. In addition, the hybrid compounds, such as COX-2 inhibitors/TP antagonists, can be an innovative treatment to control the overall balance between AA mediators in patients with COVID-19.",covid

"The emerging COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat to the global health care system. Given the lack of antiviral therapies or vaccines for the disease, the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) obtained much attention as a treatment for COVID-19. However, there are limited and uncertain clinical data to support the beneficial effect of this drug in COVID-19 treatment. HCQ has several side effects and warnings, including blindness, heart failure, and renal toxicity, even with recommended doses. For severe cases of COVID-19 or in patients with preexisting conditions, administering such a drug could be fatal, particularly when taken at high doses or in combination with other antibiotics. However, further well-designed studies that would address the optimal dose, duration of treatment, possible side effects, and long-term usage outcomes are needed to make the final decision. In this paper, we aim to discuss the risk of using HCQ in treating COVID-19 patients, including its possible side effects.",covid
"Background: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading around the world currently, seriously threatening people's health and global security as an international public health emergency. The objective of this study is to summarize China's countermeasures and experience in response to the COVID-19 emergence in order to serve as a warning for the global COVID-19 prevention and control, and further provide some suggestions for global fighting to COVID-19. Methods: Content analysis, expert consultation, and high frequency word analysis were applied in this study. Relevant data and information were collected from official websites, the experience accumulated in China during the fighting to the novel coronavirus, and suggestions from some experts. Results: As of March 29, 2020, China had accumulated 82 419 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.01%; in the mean time, the global had accumulated 596 042 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.76%. Although the mortality of COVID-19 was not so high, its harmfulness couldn't be ignored. Ten facts during COVID-19 epidemic in China were summarized in the study, including: the COVID-19 is highly contagious and can be spread through many channels; although elderly people and people with underlying diseases are susceptible, young people can also be victims; isolation is the most effective way to reduce the risk of COVID-19, and secondary disasters induced by COVID-19 should be emphasized in advance. High frequent words of experts' suggestions mainly includes: material, prevention and control, pathogeny, propaganda, education, hygiene, technology, medical care, overall planning, policy, panic, etc. The main concerns of experts are from four aspects: publicity and education, various subjects, medical materials and law construction. Conclusions: COVID-19 is a new infectious disease worldwide, and its infectious source, transmission route, susceptible population, and therapy are not clear. In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, no country can stand alone to maintain its own safety. People from all over the world should put aside their difference in ideology, religious belief, politics, economy, and culture, and only by global cooperation and globally unified actions, can we successfully overcome COVID-19 in the end.",covid
"The human pathogenic coronaviruses cause infections of the respiratory tract from mild to severe ranges. Mild cases may look like the common cold, while cases with severe disease may represent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, COVID-19 is a rapidly emerging infection and the number of COVID-19 cases and its associated deaths are quickly growing around the world. COVID-19 infection can involve multiple body organs other than respiratory tract and lungs such as liver. It is hypothesized that COVID-19-associated liver injury can hamper the host drug metabolism and excretion. Liver involvement present with the elevation of enzymatic levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) accompanied by enhanced total bilirubin and decreased albumin levels has been reported in COVID-19 cases. One of the major concerns during COVID-19 outbreak is the population with a history of pre-existing liver disorders including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic compensated, and decompensated cirrhosis. Herein, we discussed the probable correlation between COVID-19 infection and liver damages, particularly chronic and pre-existing liver diseases during COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, we explained about the liver transplant recipients and post-transplant drugs used in patients with COVID-19 infection. Finally, we discussed about the therapeutic medications administered in COVID-19 patients with underlying liver injuries and their significant considerations.",covid
"Background: During the first phase of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Italy, several strategies have been taken to deal with the pandemic outbreak. Aim of the study: To report the remodeling of the Vascular Surgery Department of San Raffaele Hospital as regards the strategies of preparation, escalation, and return to normal activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preparation, escalation, de-escalation: The Regional Authority of Lombardy remodeled the hospitalization system to allocate appropriate resources to treat patients with COVID-19 and to identify ""Hub/Spoke"" hospitals for highly specialized medical activities. The Hubs hospitals were required to guarantee full-time evaluation of all patients presenting with cardiovascular diseases with an independent pathway for patients with suspect or confirmed COVID-19 infection. San Raffaele Hospital was identified as Hub for cardiovascular emergencies and the Vascular Surgery Department was remodeled to face this epidemic situation. Surgical treatment was reserved only to symptomatic, urgent, or emergent cases. Large areas of the hospital were simultaneously reorganized to assist patients with COVID-19. Results: During this period, 135 patients were referred to San Raffaele Vascular Surgery Department. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 24 patients and, among them, acute limb ischemia was the most common cause of admission. At this time, the COVID-19 trend is in decline in Italy, and the local authorities reorganized the healthcare system to return to normal activities avoiding new escalations of COVID-19 cases. The COVID-19 pandemic will be remembered in Lombardy as a cataclysm. Nevertheless, the HUB/spoke system has proven to be a valid model in the management of ischemic emergencies. Continuous surveillance, cooperation, coordination, and communication to effectively respond to COVID-19 pandemic is crucial because COVID-19 reference centers could face similar issues in the near future.",covid

"Background: COVID-19 pandemic has taken the world by storm,especially the healthcare system. Medical practitioners of all specialties are being assigned to treat patients of COVID-19.Two authors(TV and NG) from the department of Neurosurgery who were deployed in the COVID-19 testing ward between 25thApril and 31stMay 2020 share their experience. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted including all those who were admitted in this ward.The patients were studied according to their demographic profiles,diagnoses,admitting departments,travel history and presence/absence of COVID-19-related symptoms. Relevant history regarding occupation,contact with known COVID-19 patient and co-morbid illness was noted. Those who tested positive for COVID-19 were studied further. The data from the institute's official record was updated till 14thAugust 2020. Results: During the study period,there were 256 admissions in the ward, of which 148(92 males,56 females) were patients and 108 were patients' attendants/relatives.Most patients were admitted under the departments of internal medicine(33, 22.3%) and general surgery(19, 12.8%). Of 148 patients, 46(31.1%) were admitted as they were planned for a surgery/intervention.Amongst 148 patients, 29(19.6%) had history of travel to or were residents of a red zone,four(2.7%) had history of contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 while six(4.1%) were healthcare workers.One hundred-four patients(70.2%) showed no COVID-19-related symptom. Thirty-four patients(22.9%) had associated comorbid conditions.Eight patients(5 males,3 females) with mean age of 37.6 years(range=4-69 years) tested positive for COVID-19. Conclusion: The authors share their experience and their institute's protocol in various facets during this war against COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-admission and pre-surgical testing of patients is important in preventing the spread of the disease amongst healthcare workers.",covid
"Background. Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world and has been declared a pandemic by World Health Organization. Neurological manifestations are being reported in patients with COVID-19 but clinical guidelines and effective treatments remain unclear. Objective: In this brief review, the authors examine the latest available evidence to date regarding the neurological implications of COVID-19 and how the novel coronavirus might possibly impact patients with pre-existing neurological conditions. COVID-19-specific recommendations from the American Academy of Neurology and and other neurologic disease-specific organizations are summarized. Results: Current retrospective case series and cohort studies from Wuhan, China, are indicating that almost one-third of the patients with COVID-19 have shown neurological manifestations; older age and comorbid conditions are associated worsened outcomes. Abnormal laboratory findings are being reported in acute cases of patients with COVID-19. Summary: Understanding the spectrum of neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and the impact of COVID-19 on patients with underlying neurological conditions might help to improve outcomes.",covid
"We describe our experience with three pregnant women with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who required mechanical ventilation. Recent data suggest a mortality of 88% in nonpregnant patients with COVID-19 who require intubation and mechanical ventilation. The three women we report were intubated and mechanically ventilated during pregnancy due to respiratory failure and pneumonia resulting from COVID-19. After several days of ventilation, all three were successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation and extubated, and are continuing their pregnancies with no demonstrable adverse effects. Our experience suggests that the mortality in pregnant women with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation is not necessarily as high as in nonpregnant patients with COVID-19. KEY POINTS: · Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a pandemic.. · COVID-19 may cause pneumonia or respiratory failure in pregnant women.. · Approximately 5% of women with COVID-19 will develop severe or critical disease.. · Mechanical ventilation in pregnant women may not necessarily result in high mortality rates..",covid
"Objectives: The case fatality rate of COVID-19 is higher amongst older adults than younger adults and is also higher amongst men than women. However, worry, which is a key motivator of behavioral health changes, occurs less frequently for older than younger adults, and less frequently for men than women. Building on this, we tested whether older adults - and particularly older men -- would report the least amount of COVID-19 worry and also fewer COVID-19 behavior changes. Methods: From March 23-31, 2020, we administered an online questionnaire assessing COVID-19 perceptions, worries, and behavior changes. Participants were a convenience sample of United States residents, who were community-dwelling younger adults (18-35) or older adults (65 to 81). Analyses included 146 younger adults (68 men, 78 women) and 156 older adults (82 men, 74 women). Participants was predominately White, living in suburban/urban areas, and had completed some college. Results: During the early phase of the outbreak in the United States, older adults perceived the risks of COVID-19 to be higher than did younger adults. Despite this, older men were comparatively less worried about COVID-19 than their younger counterparts. Compared to the other participants, older men had also implemented the fewest behavior changes. Discussion: Interventions are needed to increase COVID-19 behavior changes in older men. These results also highlight the importance of understanding emotional-responses to COVID-19, as these are predictive of their behavioral responses.",covid
"The Covid-19 pandemic has claimed many lives in the UK and globally. The objective of this paper is to study whether the number of deaths not registered as Covid-19-related has increased compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic. Reasons behind this might include Covid-19 underreporting, avoiding visits to hospitals or GPs, and the effects of the lockdown. I used weekly ONS data on the number of deaths in England and Wales that did not officially involve Covid-19 over the period 2015-2020. Simply observing trends is not sufficient as spikes in deaths may occasionally occur. I thus followed a difference-in-differences econometric approach to study whether there was a relative increase in deaths not registered as Covid-19-related during the pandemic, compared to a control. Results suggest that there were an additional 968 weekly deaths that officially did not involve Covid-19, compared to what would have otherwise been expected. It is possible that some people are dying from Covid-19 without being diagnosed, and/or that there are excess deaths due to other causes as a result of the pandemic. Analysing the cause of death for any excess non-covid-19 deaths will shed light upon the reasons for the increase in such deaths and will help design appropriate policy responses to save lives.",covid
"SARS-CoV-2 has been marked as a highly pathogenic coronavirus of COVID-19 disease into the human population, causing over 5.5 million confirmed cases worldwide. As COVID-19 has posed a global threat with significant human casualties and severe economic losses, there is a pressing demand to further understand the current situation and develop rational strategies to contain the drastic spread of the virus. Although there are no specific antiviral therapies that have proven effective in randomized clinical trials, currently, the rapid detection technology along with several promising therapeutics for COVID-19 have mitigated its drastic transmission. Besides, global institutions and corporations have commenced to parse out effective vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19.

"The current Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) outbreak has had a substantial impact on many aspects of general life. Although a number of studies have been published on the topic already, there has not been a critical review of studies on the impacts of COVID-19 by and on environmental factors. The current study fills this gap by presenting a critical analysis of 57 studies on the nexus between COVID-19 and the environment, published in nine journals up to May 2020. Majority of the studies in our sample are published in Science of the Total Environment (74%), and studies used mostly descriptive statistics and regression as research methods. We identified four underlying research clusters based on a systematic content analysis of the studies. The clusters are: (1) COVID-19 and environmental degradation, (2) COVID-19 and air pollution, (3) COVID-19 and climate/metrological factors and (4) COVID-19 and temperature. Besides a critical analysis of the studies in each cluster, we propose research questions to guide future research on the relationship between COVID-19 and the environment.",covid
"Purpose: COVID-19 greatly affected millions and affected the way we practice with heightened posture in the way we treat surgical patients. Surgical consensus guidelines are recommending caution in the use of laparoscopy for the theoretical possibility of viral transmission from aerosolization of tissue and peritoneal fluid during surgery. However, there has yet to be proof of COVID-19 being present in peritoneal fluid, justifying the consensus statements. We aim to assess the presence of COVID-19 in peritoneal fluid. Methods: We performed a laparoscopic appendicectomy for a COVID-19-infected patient with acute appendicitis. Peritoneal fluid and peritoneal washings were collected and sent for COVID-19 PCR. Results: The peritoneal fluid sample collected on entry and at the end of the operation was negative for COVID-19 on PCR. The patient had an uneventful recovery from surgery. Conclusions: This case revealed that COVID-19 was not detected in peritoneal fluid and peritoneal washings in a patient infected with COVID-19. This study provides novel preliminary data in the investigation of COVID-19 transmission from laparoscopy-related aerosolization.",covid
"Background: The incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in CoViD-19 patients in intensive care units (ICU) has so far been investigated in only a few studies. Prospective comparative studies with non-CoViD-19 ICU patients are completely lacking. Objective: Evaluation of the incidence of DVT in ICU patients with CoViD-19 compared to non-CoViD-19 ICU patients who were treated in the University Hospital Augsburg during the same period. In addition, the aim was to investigate what type of anticoagulation was present in CoViD-19 patients at the time the DVT occurred and to what extent DVT is associated with increased mortality in this patient population. Material and methods: In this prospective single center study, which was conducted between 18 April 2020 and 30 April 2020, 20 SARS-CoV2 positive patients were compared with 20 non-CoVid-19 patients in the ICU with respect to the occurrence of DVT. For this purpose, demographic data, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes were recorded and evaluated. Results: The rate of DVT in the investigated patient collective was markedly higher in patients with SARS-CoV2 (CoViD-19 patients 20% vs. non-CoViD-19 patients 5%). Both DVT and elevated D‑dimer levels were associated with increased mortality in the present study. Conclusion: We recommend the determination of D‑dimer levels and, in the case of elevated levels, the broad indication for compression sonography of the deep leg veins on admission of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV2. In this way DVT in the setting of CoViD-19 can be recognized early and therapeutic anticoagulation can be started. All inpatient CoViD-19 patients should receive thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin. Further studies on point of care methods (TEG®, ROTEM®) for the detection of hypercoagulability in SARS-CoV2 are necessary.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. This study aims to examine the changes in peripheral blood parameters during the early stages of COVID-19 and influenza. We analyzed the peripheral blood parameters of 169 COVID-19 patients and 131 influenza patients during the early-onset stage. Results from the patients with COVID-19 were compared with those from healthy controls and influenza patients. In addition, results from patients with common and severe COVID-19 were further compared. There were significant differences between COVID-19 and influenza patients in terms of age, white blood cell count, platelet count, percentage of neutrophils, percentage of lymphocytes, percentage of monocytes, percentage of eosinophils, percentage of basophils, neutrophil, count and monocyte count. Two parameters (monocyte count and percentage of basophils) were combined to clarify the diagnostic efficacy of COVID-19 and influenza and the area under the curve was found to be 0.772. Comparison of peripheral blood parameters from common COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and influenza patients revealed many differences during the early disease stages. The diagnostic formula developed by this study will be of benefit for physicians in the differentiation of COVID-19 and influenza.",covid
"Object: To summarize the administration model of a COVID-19 designated hospital transformed from a community hospital to improve the emergency capacity of community hospitals and the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment of medical staff in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Analyze the surrounding environment, ward layout, area management, treatment process, medical staff and patient management of the designated community hospital. Results: From February 5, 2020, to February 18, 2020, the designated community hospital has received 198 COVID-19 mild and general patients (including 41 in the hospital at the beginning of the period). Among them, 39 were transferred to module hospitals, 131 were discharged, and 28 were in the hospital at the end of the period, and none of them became severe. There were 41 medical staff, and none of them had COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: We have achieved excellent results in the prevention and control stratagems implemented in this new community-designated hospital that specializes in treating patients with COVID-19. Its diagnosis and treatment model has completed the treatment of COVID- 19 patients successfully. After adjustment, this community hospital can shoulder the critical task of being a designated hospital for COVID-19, which includes admission, isolation, and therapy of suspected and mild COVID-19 patients, reducing the medical burden of superior hospitals. Furthermore, our experience provides concepts for community hospitals to temporarily undertake medical responsibilities to reduce the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic.",covid

"Objective: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is continuing to spread. There are growing concerns on the impact of COVID-19 in cancer patients. Several papers reporting recommendations and guidelines are published. But few data on cancer patients affected by COVID-19 are available. Methods: This is a retrospective study including all consecutive patients affected by gynecological cancer who developed COVID-19. All patients were treated in an academic setting (in Milan, Lombardy, Italy) between February and March 2020. Results: Overall, 355 patients had active treatment during the study period due to newly diagnosed or recurrent gynecological disease. Among those, 19 (5.3%) patients affected developed COVID-19. All patients were asymptomatic at the time of COVID-19 detection. Six patients were diagnosed before starting planned treatments; while the remaining 13 were diagnosed for COVID-19 after their started their treatments. Considering the first group of six patients, one patient died due to COVID-19 3 days after the diagnosis; while the other patients recovered from COVID-19 after a median of three weeks. The latter group of 13 patients (treatments started) included five patients who underwent surgery and eight patients who underwent chemotherapy. Focusing on five patients who were diagnosed after surgery, we observed that two patients died during postoperative course, while in other two cases prolonged hospitalization was needed. One patient had no issues. Chemotherapy was delayed for the remaining patents without sequelae. Conclusions: Our report highlights that COVID-19 impacts the quality of treatments for cancer patients. Mortality rate is high, especially after surgery. More important, patients under active treatment for cancer are at high risk of developing severe evolution of COVID-19. Prioritizing patients journey during COVID-19 is of paramount importance.",covid
"Recent studies have focused on the comorbid conditions of the COVID-19. According to the current studies, numerous diseases including lung disease, cardiovascular disease and immunosuppression appear to be at higher risk for severe forms of the COVID-19. To date, there are no data in the literature on the comorbid dermatologic diseases and COVID-19. We tried to analyze the previous dermatological comorbidity of 93 patients with COVID-19 (51 males, 42 females) who presented to the dermatology outpatient clinics for the last 3 years. The most common dermatologic diseases in patients with COVID-19 who have dermatologic diseases for the last 3 years were superficial fungal infections (24, 25.8%), seborrheic dermatitis (11, 11.8%), actinic keratosis (10, 10.8%), psoriasis (6, 6.5%), and eczema (6, 6.5%), respectively. In addition, the number of COVID-19 patients who presented to dermatology in the last 3 months was 17 (11 men, 6 women). The median age of these patients was 58 (minimum 18, maximum 80) years, and the most common dermatologic diseases before diagnosed COVID-19 were superficial fungal infections (5, 25%), psoriasis (4, 20%), and viral skin diseases (3, 15%). The possible similarity between cutaneous and mucosal immunity and immunosuppression suggests that patients with some dermatologic diseases especially superficial fungal infections and psoriasis may be more vulnerable to the COVID-19.",covid
"COVID-19 and diabetes are both pandemics with major impacts on global public health. While the response to COVID-19 has been rapid and progressive to reduce risk of harm, the response to the diabetes pandemic has been somewhat more muted. People with diabetes have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with growing evidence of higher mortality and morbidity. In this article, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on our diabetes service in an urban area in the UK. We discuss the impact on our patients and ourselves, and the possible lessons we can carry into the future.",covid
"Objective: To describe the diagnosis, symptomatology and disease course of COVID-19 in nursing home (NH) residents in the Netherlands. Design: Prospective cohort study. Method: Data on NH residents with suspected COVID-19 were collected from the electronic patient records. Data were collected on diagnostic status (COVID-19: confirmed/excluded (using the RT-PCR test)), symptomatology (typical/atypical and other symptoms, body temperature and oxygen saturation) and, in the case of confirmed COVID-19, on disease course (recovered/clinically improved/deteriorated, deceased). We described and compared the symptomatology in NH residents with confirmed COVID-19 and NH residents in whom COVID-19 had been excluded. We also analysed mortality risk using survival analysis. We used registrations from the period 18 March to15 April 2020 for this study. Results: We reported on 1,969 NH residents with suspected COVID-19. The diagnosis was confirmed in 857 patients (43.5%); diagnosis was excluded in 1,112 (56.5%) patients. Among patients with confirmed COVID-19, 65% had coughs, 70% had fever, 33% had shortness of breath, 28% had delirium/confusion and 10% had a sore throat; in patients in whom COVID-19 was excluded these symptoms were experienced in 70%, 47%, 45%, 26% and 13% of patients, respectively. Of the patients with confirmed COVID-19, 48% died within 30 days (95% CI: 36-44%), versus 20% of the patients in whom COVID-19 was excluded (95% CI: 11-15%). Conclusion: There is a lot of overlap in symptomatology between NH residents with COVID-19 and those with other acute diseases. An RT-PCR test is required to be able to make the distinction better. The mortality risk in patients with confirmed COVID-19 is significantly higher than in patients in whom covid-19 is excluded.",covid
"Objective: This study aimed to report a case series of pregnant women in New York City with confirmed or presumed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection. Study design: Beginning March 22, 2020, all pregnant women from one large obstetrical practice in New York City were contacted regularly to inquire about symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath, malaise, anosmia), or sick contacts. A running log was kept of these patients, as well as all patients who underwent COVID-19 testing. For this report, we included every patient with suspected COVID-19 infection, which was defined as at least two symptoms, or a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test. Results: From March 22, 2020 until April 30, 2020, 757 pregnant women in our practice were evaluated and 92 had known or suspected COVID-19 (12.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.0-14.7%). Of these 92 women, 33 (36%) had positive COVID-19 test results. Only one woman required hospital admission for 5 days due to COVID-19 (1.1%, 95% CI: 0.2-5.9%). One other woman received home oxygen. No women required mechanical ventilation and there were no maternal deaths. One woman had an unexplained fetal demise at 14 weeks' gestation around the time of her COVID-19 symptoms. Twenty one of the 92 women have delivered, and all were uncomplicated. Conclusions: Among 92 women with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, the overall morbidity was low. These preliminary results are encouraging for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Key points: · Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is prevalent in New York City.. · In this case series, COVID-19 in pregnant women had a very low morbidity and no mortality.. · This preliminary data is reassuring for pregnant women at risk of COVID-19..",covid
"Background: The highest number of COVID-19 cases in Italy have been reported in Lombardy, a region in northern Italy. We aimed to analyse the course of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases living in a district of Lombardy with a high prevalence of COVID-19. Methods: We did a single-centre observational study at the Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST) Spedali Civili of Brescia, Italy. We collected data from patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases enrolled in our outpatient clinic to identify confirmed or possible cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were collected through a survey that was administered via telephone or in the outpatient clinic by rheumatologists. We also did a case-control study of all patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were admitted to the ASST Spedali Civili of Brescia during the study period. Cases were matched by age, sex, and month of hospital admission to at least two controls admitted to the same hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia during the study period. Findings: Between Feb 24 and May 1, 2020, we collected data from 1525 patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases: 117 (8%) presented with symptoms that were compatible with COVID-19. 65 patients had a swab confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas 52 presented with a spectrum of symptoms indicative of COVID-19 but were not swab tested. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were older than those with suspected COVID-19 (median age 68 [IQR 55-76] years vs 57 [49-67] years; p=0·0010) and more likely to have arterial hypertension (33 [51%] vs 14 [27%] patients; odds ratio [OR] 2·8 [95% CI 1·3-6·1]; p=0·031) and obesity (11 [17%] vs 1 [2%]; OR 11·0 [1·3-83·4]; p=0·0059). We found no differences in rheumatological disease or background therapy between confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. 47 (72%) of the 65 patients with confirmed COVID-19 developed pneumonia that required admission to hospital. 12 (10%) deaths occurred among the 117 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (ten in those with confirmed COVID-19 and two in those with suspected COVID-19). Deceased patients with confirmed COVID-19 were older than survivors (median age 78·8 years [IQR 75·3-81·3] vs 65·5 years [53·3-74·0]; p=0·0002). We observed no differences in sex, comorbidities, or therapies between the deceased patients and survivors. The case-control study comprised 26 patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases and COVID-19 pneumonia and 62 matched controls. We found no significant differences between cases and controls in duration of COVID-19 symptoms before admission, duration of stay in hospital, or the local chest X-ray scoring system. Glucocorticoids were used for severe respiratory manifestations related to lung involvement in 17 (65%) of 26 cases and tocilizumab in six (23%) of 26; thrombotic events occurred in four (15%) of 26 cases. Four (15%) of 26 cases and six (10%) of 62 controls died during the study period. Interpretation: In this cohort of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases in a geographical region with a high prevalence of COVID-19, a poor outcome from COVID-19 seems to be associated with older age and the presence of comorbidities rather than the type of rheumatic disease or the degree of pharmacological immunosuppression. Funding: None.",covid
"Background: Following its initial description in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus-2 (COVID-19) has rapidly progressed into a worldwide pandemic, affecting millions of lives. Although every specialty of medicine has been affected, the field of allergy/immunology holds a special place in the battle against this modern-day plague. Because of the specialized training in allergy and clinical immunology, and the familiarity with comorbid contributing conditions, the allergist/immunologist is uniquely poised to play a major role both in the delivery of specialized therapeutic procedures and practices that can improve the health of patients with COVID-19 as well as in the use of forthcoming vaccines for the prevention of its spread. Objective: The purpose of this report is to examine the current body of evidence supporting the two phases of infection and inflammation that influence the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and to provide a classification of COVID-19 disease presentations and potential therapeutic targets with which the allergist/immunologist has particular expertise. Methods: This article was based on a literature review of articles published in PubMed related to COVID-19 and the immune response, and the author's own research and clinical experiences in the field of immunology. Results: Currently, the management of COVID-19 disease is being directed by a preventive strategy based on social distancing, quarantine, and facemasks to reduce the spread of the virus. Numerous clinical trials are being initiated to identify effective treatments for COVID-19 and are directed toward treatment of the two phases of infection and inflammation that influence the pathogenesis of COVID-19. An important resource for the allergist/immunologist is the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (COVID-19 TGP), a National Institutes of Health sponsored panel of U.S. physicians, statisticians, and other experts, which has developed a set of continuously updated treatment guidelines intended for clinicians caring for patients during the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: COVID-19 is unique among other infectious diseases because, in many cases, the host immune inflammatory response can cause greater harm to the individual who is infected than the pathogen itself. In this report, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the influence it has on COVID-19 presentations is reviewed, together with recommended potential therapeutic targets and treatment recommendations.",covid
"Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess how different social determinants of health (SDoH) may be related to variability in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rates in cities and towns in Massachusetts (MA). Methods: Data about the total number of cases, tests, and rates of COVID-19 as of June 10, 2020 were obtained for cities and towns in MA. The data on COVID-19 were matched with data on various SDoH variables at the city and town level from the American Community Survey. These variables included information about income, poverty, employment, renting, and insurance coverage. We compared COVID-19 rates according to these SDoH variables. Results: There were clear gradients in the rates of COVID-19 according to SDoH variables. Communities with more poverty, lower income, lower insurance coverage, more unemployment, and a higher percentage of the workforce employed in essential services, including healthcare, had higher rates of COVID-19. Most of these differences were not accounted for by different rates of testing in these cities and towns. Conclusions: SDoH variables may explain some of the variability in the risk of COVID-19 across cities and towns in MA. Data about SDoH should be part of the standard surveillance for COVID-19. Efforts should be made to address social factors that may be putting communities at an elevated risk.",covid
"Purpose: Patients with cancer are at high risk for mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is a common toxicity of thoracic radiation therapy with clinical and imaging features that overlap with those of COVID-19; however, RP is treated with high-dose corticosteroids, which may exacerbate COVID-19-associated lung injury. We reviewed patients who presented with symptoms of RP during the intensification of a regional COVID-19 epidemic to report on their clinical course and COVID-19 testing results. Methods and materials: The clinical course and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings of consecutive patients who presented with symptoms of RP in March 2020 were reviewed. The first regional COVID-19 case was diagnosed on March 1, 2020. All patients underwent COVID-19 qualitative RNA testing. Results: Four patients with clinical suspicion for RP were assessed. Three out of 4 patients tested positive for COVID-19. All patients presented with symptoms of cough and dyspnea. Two patients had a fever, of whom only 1 tested positive for COVID-19. Two patients started on an empirical high-dose corticosteroid taper for presumed RP, but both had clinical deterioration and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 and required hospitalization. Chest CT findings in patients suspected of RP but ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19 showed ground-glass opacities mostly pronounced outside the radiation field. Conclusions: As this pandemic continues, patients with symptoms of RP require diagnostic attention. We recommend that patients suspected of RP be tested for COVID-19 before starting empirical corticosteroids and for careful attention to be paid to chest CT imaging to prevent potential exacerbation of COVID-19 in these high-risk patients.",covid
"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was formally characterized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Since that time, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented demand for healthcare resources. The purpose of this study was to identify changes in laboratory test utilization in the setting of increasing local incidence of COVID-19. Methods: We performed a retrospective assessment of laboratory test order and specimen container utilization at a single, urban tertiary care medical center. Data were extracted from the laboratory information system database over a 10-week period, spanning the primordial inflection of COVID-19 incidence in our region. Total testing volumes were calculated during the first and last two-weeks of the observation period and used as reference points to examine the absolute and relative differences in test order volume between the pre-pandemic and COVID-19 surge periods. Results: Between February 2, 2020 and April 11, 2020, there were 873,397 tests ordered and final verified. The in-house SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rate for admitted patients in the last week of the observation period was 30.8%. Significant increases in workload were observed in the send-out laboratory section and for COVID-19 diagnosis (PCR) and management-related testing. Otherwise, there was a net decrease in overall demand across nearly all laboratory sections. Increases in testing were noted for tests related to COVID-19 management. Viral transport media and citrated blue top containers demonstrated increases in utilization. Conclusion: Increasing local incidence of COVID-19 had a profound impact on laboratory operations. While volume increases were seen for laboratory tests related to COVID-19 diagnostics and management, including some with limited evidence to support their use, overall testing volumes decreased substantially. During events such as COVID-19, monitoring of such patterns can help inform laboratory management, staffing, and test stewardship recommendations for managing resource and supply availability.",covid
"Many Indian COVID-19 suicide cases are turning the press-media attention and flooding in the social media platforms although, no particular studies assessed the COVID-19 suicide causative factors to a large extent. Therefore, the present study presents 69 COVID-19 suicide cases (aged 19 to 65 years; 63 cases were males). The suicide causalities are included as follows - fear of COVID-19 infection (n=21), followed by financial crisis (n=19), loneliness, social boycott and pressure to be quarantine, COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 work-related stress, unable to come back home due to lockdown, unavailability of alcohol etc. Considering the extreme psychological impacts related to COVID-19, there emerges a need for countrywide extensive tele-mental health care services.",covid
"Background: Because of the rapid spread of COVID-19, on March 8, 2020 Italy became a ""protected area"": people were told not to leave their homes unless it was essential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of our trauma center, relative to shoulder and elbow, in the 30 days starting from March 8, 2020, the first day of restrictions in Italy, and to compare it with the same days of 2019 to weigh the impact of COVID-19 on shoulder and elbow trauma. Materials and methods: Patients managed in our trauma center between March 8, 2020, and April 8, 2020 (COVID period), for shoulder and elbow trauma were retrospectively included and compared to patients admitted in the same period of 2019 (no-COVID period). Clinical records of all participants were examined to obtain information regarding age, sex, mechanism of injury, and diagnosis. Results: During the no-COVID period, 133 patients were admitted for a shoulder or elbow trauma; in the COVID period, there were 47 patients (65% less first aid). In the no-COVID and COVID period, patients with shoulder contusion totaled 60 (14.78% of all; male [M]: 34; female [F]: 26; mean age 51.8 years, range 18-88) and 11 (12.09% of all contusions; M: 7, F: 4; mean age 43 years, range 24-60), respectively. In the no-COVID period, 27 fractures (9.34% of all fractures) involved the shoulder, whereas 18 fractures (8.69%) were registered in the COVID period. In the no-COVID period, 14 elbow fractures were treated (4.8% of all fractures), compared with 4 in the COVID period. In the no-COVID and COVID periods, 6 patients (M: 5, F: 1; mean age 42 years, range 21-64) and 2 patients (M: 1, F: 1; mean age 29.5 years, range 24-35) reported having a feeling of momentary post-traumatic shoulder instability, and 0 and 1 patients (M: 1, F: 0; age 56 years), respectively, reported similar symptoms at the elbow. Finally, first or recurrent dislocations in the no-COVID period were 10, and in the COVID period, 7; elbow dislocations in the no-COVID period were 2, and in the COVID period, there were 3. Conclusions: During the COVID period, we provided a reduced number of health services, especially for patients with low-energy trauma and for those who underwent sports and traffic accidents. However, during the COVID period, elderly subjects remain exposed to shoulder and elbow trauma due to low-energy (domestic) falls. The subsequent hospitalization of these patients has contributed to making it more difficult to manage the hospital wards that are partly occupied by COVID-19 patients.",covid
"Despite the increasing large population of COVID-19+ infected patients, knowledge of the disease remains limited. Understanding the effects and long-term implications of COVID-19 will be paramount to implementing the right public health measures and developing future preventive and effective treatments. In this article, we discuss currently available information with COVID-19-related neurological complications, possible routes of virus infection into the central nervous system, and hypothesis about virus-induced cytokine storm syndrome, long-term outcomes, as well as ongoing clinical studies of novel therapies and biomarkers for COVID-19. Understanding the effects of COVID-19 on neurological systems is crucial for properly diagnosing and caring for the disease. We need to be prepared that COVID-19 could cause long-lasting debilitations after the infection has cleared. Investigating long-term effects of the disease will yield insight for providing comprehensive care to the survivors. Understanding these risks will also lead to better treatments as well as inform policies to create a system capable of caring for those affected by COVID-19 long after the pandemic has subsided.",covid
"Objective: Obesity has been found to be a risk factor for hospitalization with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study investigated whether patients hospitalized with COVID-19 differed in BMI at older versus younger ages and whether trends were independent of diabetes and hypertension. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital from March 19, 2020, until April 4, 2020, was performed. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 above and below the age of 50 were compared as well as those hospitalized without COVID-19. Results: Patients younger than 50 years of age hospitalized with COVID-19 without diabetes or hypertension had mean BMI greater than those older than 50 years of age, with BMI 43.1 (95% CI: 34.5-51.7) versus 30.1 (95% CI: 27.7-32.5) (P = 0.02). Furthermore, BMI appeared to inversely correlate with increasing age among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We did not detect the same difference or trend for patients hospitalized without COVID-19. Conclusions: Younger patients (age < 50 years) with COVID-19 had higher mean BMI than older patients with COVID-19, with and without diabetes and hypertension. This trend did not exist in patients without COVID-19 hospitalized during the same time period.",covid
"In the wake of the recent pandemic of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with confirmed cases having crossed 750,000, health systems across the world are getting overwhelmed; making it strenuous to maintain essential health services. Several changes were implemented in our acute mental health care service using a collaborative approach to maintain a balance between preventive measures to 'flatten the curve' and to provide care to those who were in need. Mode of service delivery was changed predominantly to tele-medicine, amongst others. It was found to be a workable model, albeit further follow up will be required to better understand its viability and feasibility to withstand the COVID-19 cataclysm.",covid
"The world and Kenya face a potential pandemic as the respiratory virus Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects world populations. Nations have been forced to intervene and issue directions under executive orders to ensure the pandemic is contained. Kenya has reported 110 confirmed COVID-19 cases (as at 2nd April, 2020), three persons have succumbed and 2 people have fully recovered. Most of the affected people had entered/returned to Kenya from different parts of the world. Most of the people who have contracted COVID 19 are between the 16-74 years of age. As a result, since February 2020, Kenya put in place several precautionary measures to mitigate the pandemic in its early stages. However, the economic status of the population of country won't be simple to control COVID 19, if government won't integrate the realistic feasible timely plans. This article highlights the preparedness, response, transmissibility of Covid-19 and proposes intuitions to manage COVID-19 in Kenya. Currently it is clear that since first confirmation to current, the transmission of the COVID-19 is exponentially increasing in Kenya.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which causes serious respiratory illness such as pneumonia and lung failure, was first reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China. The etiological agent of COVID-19 has been confirmed as a novel coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is most likely originated from zoonotic coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002. Within a few months of the first report, SARS-CoV-2 had spread across China and worldwide, reaching a pandemic level. As COVID-19 has triggered enormous human casualties and serious economic loss posing global threat, an understanding of the ongoing situation and the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed. Currently, various diagnostic kits to test for COVID-19 are available and several repurposing therapeutics for COVID-19 have shown to be clinically effective. In addition, global institutions and companies have begun to develop vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19. Here, we review the current status of epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development for COVID-19.",covid
"The world is currently in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic which has halted the tourism sector and created an unprecedented global economic crisis. This paper will outline economics pertaining to COVID-19 lockdown, recovery and the inevitable competition that will occur between countries for tourists who will be scarcer and therefore more valuable. Countries are competing with a variety of incentives in order to lure visitors. However, persistent first waves that extend into July will put off tourists, further reducing tourism revenues and accelerate job losses and bankruptcies in affected countries. The example of Sweden's response to COVID-19 in this regard will be described. Countries that have COVID-19 relatively under control but experience second waves will also manifest negative tourism effects. Governments and public health must act in unison so as to exit lockdown as speedily and as safely as feasible, with COVID-19 rises that are as low and brief as possible in order to better compete in the tourism sector with other countries. Websites are already online comparing not only safety for travellers vis-à-vis COVID-19 but also the incentives offered by different countries in their attempts to woo tourists in this difficult market.",covid
"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) is the entry receptor for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the aetiological agent of COVID-19. At the same time, ACE 2 expression decreases during COVID-19. Two seemingly contradictory relationships between the expression of ACE 2 and COVID-19 have been reported. Increased level of expression of ACE 2 may be a risk factor for the development of COVID-19 infection, while reduced ACE 2 expression during COVID-19 leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome. This article provides a comprehensive overview of available scientific knowledge about the role of ACE 2 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, which is available up to current day. Also, it discusses unknown factors that we will have to reveal in order to understand the whole role of ACE 2 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.",covid
"As the global COVID-19 pandemic evolves, our knowledge of the respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms continues to grow. One such symptom, anosmia, may be a neurologic marker of coronavirus infection and the initial presentation of infected patients. Because this symptom is not routinely investigated by imaging, there is conflicting literature on neuroimaging abnormalities related to COVID-19-related anosmia. We present a novel case of COVID-19 anosmia with definitive olfactory bulb atrophy compared with pre-COVID imaging. The patient had prior MR imaging related to a history of prolactinoma that provided baseline volumes of her olfactory bulbs. After a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 and approximately 2 months duration of anosmia, an MRI was performed that showed clear interval olfactory bulb atrophy. This diagnostic finding is of prognostic importance and indicates that the olfactory entry point to the brain should be further investigated to improve our understanding of COVID infectious pathophysiology.",covid
"Evidence shows that COVID-19 can exacerbate symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pancreaticobiliary disorders, and it is important to distinguish between an IBD exacerbation and symptoms caused by COVID-19. Although IBD does not appear to increase the risk for COVID-19 or worsen outcomes, corticosteroids can increase the risk and should be avoided when treating these patients. Pancreatic and biliary disease have been described in patients with COVID-19, but it is not clear whether COVID-19 induces these diseases. For facilities resuming endoscopic procedures, there are consensus guidelines for minimizing the COVID-19 transmission risks with these procedures.",covid
"Background: Susceptibility to severe viral infections was reported to be associated with genetic variants in immune response genes using case reports and GWAS studies. SARS-CoV-2 is an emergent viral disease that caused millions of COVID-19 cases all over the world. Around 15 % of cases are severe and some of them are accompanied by dysregulated immune system and cytokine storm. There is increasing evidence that severe manifestations of COVID-19 might be attributed to human genetic variants in genes related to immune deficiency and or inflammasome activation (cytokine storm). Objective: Identify the candidate genes that are likely to aid in explaining severe COVID-19 and provide insights to understand the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. Methods: In this article, we systematically reviewed genes related to viral susceptibility that were reported in human genetic studies (Case-reports and GWAS) to understand the role of host viral interactions and to provide insights into the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. Results: We found 40 genes associated with viral susceptibility and 21 of them were associated with severe SARS-CoV disease and severe COVID-19. Some of those genes were implicated in TLR pathways, others in C-lectin pathways, and others were related to inflammasome activation (cytokine storm). Conclusion: This compilation represents a list of candidate genes that are likely to aid in explaining severe COVID-19 which are worthy of inclusion in gene panels and during meta-analysis of different variants in host genetics studies of COVID-19. In addition, we provide several hypotheses for severe COVID-19 and possible therapeutic targets.",covid
"Background: The global outbreak of COVID-19 incepted in Wuhan, China in the late 2019. It is still unclear about the origin of the infection. Over time, it has migrated geographically to 150 countries in the world and World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the infectious disease to be pandemic. Objective: Recently, COVID-19 has stepped into India by the travellers from other countries. The transmissibility and epidemicity of COVID-19 in India is exponential. So, in-order to understand the above characteristics, specifically COVID-19 status in India is analyzed. To analyze this into deeper, the state of Kerala is selected. The epidemiological characteristics of patients in Kerala, South India and the possible transmission of COVID-19 from asymptomatic members to other peers are shown using certain cases. Methods: The COVID-19 dataset is taken from Kaggle dataset. This dataset contains the details of the infected patients from different states of India. Statistical analysis techniques where used to analyze the distribution of the affected cases in a particular state. Results: The analysis shows that there is possibility of transmission of the infection even during incubation period. The recent trend in the number of infected cases in India is discussed. Conclusion: The transmissibility of COVID-19 and its epidemicity in India is discussed. In specific, a case study on COVID -19 cases in the state of Kerala relating the transmissibility is also summarized. Further, data related to patents on corona virus is also discussed. From the analysis, it can be concluded that there is a possibility of COVID-19 transmission even during incubation period. The preventive measures to overcome COVID-19 and methods to increase the immunity are discussed.",covid
"Anosmia has been recognized as a prevalent and early symptom by many COVID-19 patients. However, most researchers have recorded smell dysfunction solely as present or absent and based on subjective evaluation by patients. We described the results of 57 consecutive COVID-19 patients seen at FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from April to May 2020. Data about the presence of smell loss, the onset of smell loss and other COVID-19 symptoms such as ageusia and nasal congestion or rhinorrhea were recorded. All patients at the initial consultation and 34 healthy controls underwent the Q-SIT, which is a quick disposable three-item smell identification test, by a trained physician. We compared three groups: healthy controls, COVID+ patients with reported smell loss (COVID w/ SL) and COVID+ patients without smell loss (COVID+ w/o SL). The mean age of patients was 41.4 years (SD ± 10.4), and 54.4% were women. Smell loss was reported by 40.4% of COVID-19 patients. We observed a gradual effect with higher Q-SIT scores in healthy controls, followed by COVID+ w/o SL and COVID+ w/ SL (medians = 3, 2 and 0; respectively, p < 0.001). Anosmia or severe microsmia (Q-SIT≤1) was present in 11.1% (CI: 3.1%-26.1%) of controls, 32.4% (CI: 17.4%-50.5%) of COVID-19 w/o SL and 87% (CI: 66.4%-97.2%) of COVID+ w/ SL (p < 0.001). This study provides evidence that olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 is common and more prevalent than what is perceived by patients. Q-SIT is a quick and reliable screening test for the detection of smell dysfunction during the pandemics.",covid
"In order to control the spread of COVID-19, people must adopt preventive behaviours that can affect their day-to-day life. People's self-efficacy to adopt preventive behaviours to avoid COVID-19 contagion and spread should be studied. The aim of this study was to develop and psychometrically test the COVID-19 prevention, detection, and home-management self-efficacy scale (COVID-19-SES). We conducted an observational cross-sectional study. Six-hundred and seventy-eight people participated in the study. Data were collected between March and May 2020. The COVID-19-SES' validity (content, criterion, and construct), reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability), and legibility were studied. The COVID-19-SES' reliability was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.906; intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.754). The COVID-19-SES showed good content validity (scale's content validity index = 0.92) and good criterion validity when the participants' results on the COVID-19-SES were compared to their general self-efficacy (r = 0.38; p < 0.001). Construct validity analysis revealed that the COVID-19-SES' three-factor structure explained 52.12% of the variance found and it was congruent with the World Health Organisation's recommendations to prevent COVID-19 contagion and spread. Legibility analysis showed that the COVID-19-SES is easy to read and understand by laypeople. The COVID-19-SES is a psychometrically robust instrument that allows for a valid and reliable assessment of people's self-efficacy in preventing, detecting symptoms, and home-managing COVID-19.",covid

However, instead of discouraging them, these events have in many ways strengthened the resilience of the class of 2020. Additionally, COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of continued advocacy for the profession and articulation of the pharmacist's expanded role and value to the health care team, and inspired the class of 2020 to join the ranks of colleagues nationwide in raising awareness in these areas. Nevertheless, uncertainty over their future and that of their peers lingers as COVID-19 has forever changed pharmacy education and practice.",covid
"Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, many patients with underlying disease, such as interstitial lung disease (ILD), were admitted to Tongji hospital in Wuhan, China. To date, no data have ever been reported to reflect the clinical features of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among these patients with preexisting ILD. We analyzed the incidence and severity of COVID-19 patients with ILD among 3201 COVID-19 inpatients, and compared two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing ILD (n = 28) and non-ILD COVID-19 patients (n = 130). Among those 3201 COVID-19 inpatients, 28 of whom were COVID-19 with ILD (0.88%). Fever was the predominant symptom both in COVID-19 with ILD (81.54%) and non-ILD COVID-19 patients (72.22%). However, COVID-19 patients with ILD were more likely to have cough, sputum, fatigue, dyspnea, and diarrhea. A very significantly higher number of neutrophils, monocytes, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, IL-1β, and D-Dimer was characterized in COVID-19 with ILD as compared to those of non-ILD COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, logistic regression models showed neutrophils counts, proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL6, IL1β, IL2R), and coagulation dysfunction biomarkers (D-Dimer, PT, Fbg) were significantly associated with the poor clinical outcomes of COVID-19. ILD patients could be less vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. However, ILD patients tend to severity condition after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. The prognosis of COVID-19 patients with per-existing ILD is significantly worse than that of non-ILD patients. And more, aggravated inflammatory responses and coagulation dysfunction appear to be the critical mechanisms in the COVID-19 patients with ILD.",covid
"Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, there have been nearly 6,663,304 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 392,802 deaths, worldwide as of 10:00 CEST 06 June 2020. In Africa, 152,442 COVID-19 cases and 4334 deaths have been reported as of 02 June 2020. The five countries with the highest commutative number of cases in Africa are South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Algeria, and Ghana. Africa, and the rest of world, has had to swiftly undertake the necessary measures to protect the continent from irreversible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that is claiming lives and destroying livelihoods. The lower number of COVID-19 cases in most African countries is attributed to inadequate health systems, low-to-absent testing capacity, poor reporting systems, and insufficient numbers of medical staff. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great threat to most African countries, from cities to rural areas, and has created a strong demand on already scarce resources. Intense mobilization of additional resources is required to implement established emergency contingency measures. Measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 include closure of borders and restricting movement of people within a country; this has resulted in the tourism sector being adversely affected by the loss of income. Cooperative prevention and control measures are one of the promising solutions to deplete the spread of COVID-19 on the continent.",covid
"Background: Authors have noticed an increase in lung apex abnormalities on CT angiography (CTA) of the head and neck performed for stroke workup during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Objective: To evaluate the incidence of these CTA findings and their relation to COVID-19 infection. Methods: In this retrospective multicenter institutional review board-approved study, assessment was made of CTA findings of code patients who had a stroke between March 16 and April 5, 2020 at six hospitals across New York City. Demographic data, comorbidities, COVID-19 status, and neurological findings were collected. Assessment of COVID-19 related lung findings on CTA was made blinded to COVID-19 status. Incidence rates of COVID-19 related apical findings were assessed in all code patients who had a stroke and in patients with a stroke confirmed by imaging. Results: The cohort consisted of a total of 118 patients with mean±SD age of 64.9±15.7 years and 57.6% (68/118) were male. Among all code patients who had a stroke, 28% (33/118) had COVID-19 related lung findings. RT-PCR was positive for COVID-19 in 93.9% (31/33) of these patients with apical CTA findings.Among patients who had a stroke confirmed by imaging, 37.5% (18/48) had COVID-19 related apical findings. RT-PCR was positive for COVID-19 in all (18/18) of these patients with apical findings. Conclusion: The incidence of COVID-19 related lung findings in stroke CTA scans was 28% in all code patients who had a stroke and 37.5% in patients with a stroke confirmed by imaging. Stroke teams should closely assess the lung apices during this COVID-19 pandemic as CTA findings may be the first indicator of COVID-19 infection.",covid
"Several clinical trials are being conducted worldwide to investigate the protective effect of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine against death in healthcare providers who are working directly with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Clinical studies suggested that certain live vaccines, particularly BCG vaccine, could reduce the mortality due to other diseases caused by non-targeted pathogens, most probably through what is known as non-specific effects (heterologous effects). The most recent available information on the COVID-19 pandemic indicated the great effect of BCG vaccine in reducing the number of COVID-19 death cases. The occurrence of death due to COVID-19 was found to be 21-fold lower in countries with a national BCG vaccination policy than in countries without such a policy, based on the medians of COVID-19 death case per 1 million of population in these two groups of countries (P<0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). Therefore, it can be concluded that the early establishment of BCG vaccination policy in any country is a key element in reducing the number of COVID-19 and tuberculosis death cases.",covid
"In this issue of Blood, Mato et al report an international, multicenter analysis of 198 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and symptomatic COVID-19. In this analysis, COVID-19 appears to be more severe in CLL patients than in the general population and, although risk factors are the same as for the general COVID-19 population, the outcome of patients needing admission is poor, with a case fatality rate of 37%. The Mato et al paper is particularly compelling as reports of COVID-19 in specific diseases are needed, particularly in cancer where COVID-19 adds to the physical and emotional distress these patients already suffer. Also, clinicians need guidance on how to advise and manage these patients.",covid
"Background: The recent identification of a novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, has caused a global outbreak of respiratory illnesses. The rapidly developing pandemic has posed great challenges to diagnosis of this novel infection. However, little is known about the metatranscriptomic characteristics of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: We analyzed metatranscriptomics in 187 patients (62 cases with COVID-19 and 125 with non-COVID-19 pneumonia). Transcriptional aspects of three core elements - pathogens, the microbiome, and host responses - were interrogated. Based on the host transcriptional signature, we built a host gene classifier and examined its potential for diagnosing COVID-19 and indicating disease severity. Results: The airway microbiome in COVID-19 patients had reduced alpha diversity, with 18 taxa of differential abundance. Potentially pathogenic microbes were also detected in 47% of the COVID-19 cases, 58% of which were respiratory viruses. Host gene analysis revealed a transcriptional signature of 36 differentially expressed genes significantly associated with immune pathways such as cytokine signaling. The host gene classifier built on such a signature exhibited potential for diagnosing COVID-19 (AUC of 0.75-0.89) and indicating disease severity. Conclusions: Compared to those with non-COVID-19 pneumonias, COVID-19 patients appeared to have a more disrupted airway microbiome with frequent potential concurrent infections, and a special trigger host immune response in certain pathways such as interferon gamma signaling. The immune-associated host transcriptional signatures of COVID-19 hold promise as a tool for improving COVID-19 diagnosis and indicating disease severity.",covid
"This paper highlights the enormous economic and social impact of COVID-19 with respect to articles that have either prognosticated such a large-scale event, and its economic consequences, or have assessed the impacts of other epidemics and pandemics. A consideration of possible impacts of COVID-19 on financial markets and institutions, either directly or indirectly, is briefly outlined by drawing on a variety of literatures. A consideration of the characteristics of COVID-19, along with what research suggests have been the impacts of other past events that in some ways roughly parallel COVID-19, points toward avenues of future investigation.",covid
"Current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 inducing viral COVID-19 pneumonia, is categorized in 3 stages. Some biomarkers could be assigned to one of these stages, showing a correlation to mortality in COVID-19 patients. Laboratory findings in COVID-19, especially when serially evaluated, may represent individual disease severity and prognosis. These may help planning and controlling therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers for myocardial injury (high sensitive cardiac troponin, hsTn) or hemodynamic stress (NTproBNP) may occur in COVID-19 pneumonia such as in other pneumonias, correlating with severity and prognosis of the underlying disease. In hospitalized COVID-19 patients' mild increases of hsTn or NTproBNP may be explained by cardiovascular comorbidities and direct or indirect cardiac damage or stress caused by or during COVID-19 pneumonia. In case of suspected NSTE-ACS and COVID-19, indications for echocardiography or reperfusion strategy should be carefully considered against the risk of contamination.",covid
"Purpose: Because of the widespread use of CT in the diagnosis of COVID 19, indeterminate presentations such as single, few or unilateral lesions amount to a considerable number. We aimed to develop a new classification and structured reporting system on CT imaging (COVID-19 S) that would facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the most accurate way. Methods: Our retrospective cohort included 803 patients with a chest CT scan upon suspicion of COVID 19. The patients' history, physical examination, CT findings, RT PCR, and other laboratory test results were reviewed, and a final diagnosis was made as COVID 19 or non-COVID 19. Chest CT scans were classified according to the COVID 19 S CT diagnosis criteria. Cohen's kappa analysis was used. Results: Final clinical diagnosis was COVID-19 in 98 patients (12%). According to the COVID-19 S CT diagnosis criteria, the number of patients in the normal, compatible with COVID 19, indeterminate and alternative diagnosis groups were 581 (72.3%), 97 (12.1%), 16 (2.0%) and 109 (13.6%). When the indeterminate group was combined with the group compatible with COVID 19, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 S were 99.0% and 87.1%, with 85.8% positive predictive value (PPV) and 99.1% negative predictive value (NPV). When the indeterminate group was combined with the alternative diagnosis group, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 S were 93.9% and 96.0%, with 94.8% PPV and 95.2% NPV. Conclusion: COVID-19 S CT classification system may meet the needs of radiologists in distinguishing COVID-19 from pneumonia of other etiologies and help optimize patient management and disease control in this pandemic by the use of structured reporting.",covid
"The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first detected at the end of December 2019. The epidemic has affected various regions of China in different degrees. As the situations evolve, the COVID-19 had been confirmed in many countries, and made a assessment that it can be characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Drugs are the main treatment of COVID-19 patients. Pharmaceutical service offers drug safety ensurance for COVID-19 patients. According to COVID-19 prevention and control policy and requirements, combined with series of diagnosis and treatment plans, pharmacists in the first provincial-level COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment unit in Jilin Province in Northeast China have established the management practices of drug supply and pharmaceutical care from four aspects: personnel, drugs supply management, off-label drug use management and pharmaceutical care. During the outbreak, the pharmaceutical department of THJU completed its assigned workload to ensure drug supply. So far, no nosocomial infections and medication errors have occurred, which has stabilized the mood of the staff and boosted the pharmacists' confidence in fighting the epidemic. For the treatment of COVID-19, pharmacists conducted adverse reaction monitoring and participated in the multidisciplinary consultation of COVID-19. Up to now, the COVID-19 patients admitted to THJU have not shown any new serious adverse reactions and been cured finally. The hospital pharmacy department timely adjusted the work mode, and the formed management practices is a powerful guarantee for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic. This paper summarized the details and practices of drug supply and pharmaceutical services management to provide experience for the people who involving in COVID-19 prevention and contain in other abroad epidemic areas.",covid
"Background: The number of excess deaths during February-March 2020 in Italy, in comparison with previous years, was considerably higher than the recorded COVID19-related deaths. The present study aimed to explore the association of excess mortality with some indices related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its management. Methods: Data on all-cause mortality from 20 February-31 March in the years 2015-2020, and demographic, socioeconomic and healthcare organisation data of each Italian region were obtained from the Italian Institute of Statistics. Non-COVID-19-Imputed Excess Mortality (NCIEM) was calculated as the difference between the excess 2020 mortality and reported COVID-19 mortality. The association of NCIEM with the rate of COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 mortality and other potential moderators was assessed using linear regression models. Results: The nationwide number of excess deaths and COVID-19 deaths was 26,701 and 13,710, respectively, with a difference of 12,991. The NCIEM in different regions showed a direct correlation with COVID-19 mortality (r2 = 0.61, p < 0.001) and total cases (r2 = 0.30, p = 0.012), and an inverse correlation with cases/total tests ratio (r2 = 0.49, p = 0.001). Direct correlations were also found with the proportion of institutionalised elderly, whereas inverse correlations were observed with prevalence of diabetes, cardiovascular mortality and density of general practitioners. Conclusions: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all-cause mortality was considerably greater than that indicated by official counts of victims. Limited testing capacity and causes of death other than COVID-19 could have contributed to the increase in overall mortality rates.",covid
"Background: Few studies have examined the prehospital presentation, assessment, or treatment of patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this preliminary report is to describe prehospital encounters for patients with a COVID-19 hospital diagnosis and/or COVID-19 EMS suspicion versus those with neither a hospital diagnosis nor EMS suspicion of the disease. Methods: This case series evaluated electronic patient care records from EMS agencies participating in a large national bi-directional data exchange. All records for 9-1-1 responses between March 1 and April 19, 2020, resulting in transport to a hospital, with at least one ICD-10 outcome returned via the data exchange were included. Hospital ICD-10 codes used to determine COVID-19 diagnoses included B97.2, B97.21, B97.29, B34.2, and U07.1. COVID-19 EMS suspicion was defined as a documented EMS primary or secondary impression of COVID-19, or indication of COVID-19 suspicion in the prehospital free-text narrative. Comparisons were stratified by COVID-19 hospital diagnosis and COVID-19 EMS suspicion. Descriptive and comparative statistics are presented. Results: There were 84,540 EMS patient records with linked hospital ICD-10 codes included. Of those, 814 (1%) patients had a COVID-19 hospital diagnosis. Overall, COVID-19 EMS suspicion was documented for 3,204 (4%) patients. A COVID-19 EMS suspicion was documented for 636 (78%) of hospital diagnosed COVID-19 patients. Those with COVID-19 hospital diagnoses were more likely to present with tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia, and fever during the EMS encounter. EMS responses for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were also more likely to originate from a skilled nursing/assisted living facility. EMS PPE (eye protection, mask, or gown) use was more frequently documented on records of patients who had hospital diagnosed COVID-19. Conclusion: In this large sample of prehospital encounters, EMS COVID-19 suspicion demonstrated sensitivity of 78% and positive predictive value of 20% compared with hospital ICD-10 codes. These data indicate that EMS suspicion alone is insufficient to determine appropriate utilization of PPE.",covid
"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) surges worldwide. However, massive imported patients especially into Heilongjiang Province in China recently have been an alert for local COVID-19 outbreak. We collected data from January 23 to March 25 from Heilongjiang province and trained an ordinary differential equation model to fit the epidemic data. We extended the simulation using this trained model to characterize the effect of an imported 'escaper'. We showed that an imported 'escaper' was responsible for the newly confirmed COVID-19 infections from Apr 9 to Apr 19 in Heilongjiang province. Stochastic simulations further showed that significantly increased local contacts among imported 'escaper', its epidemiologically associated cases and susceptible populations greatly contributed to the local outbreak of COVID-19. Meanwhile, we further found that the reported number of asymptomatic patients was markedly lower than model predictions implying a large asymptomatic pool which was not identified. We further forecasted the effect of implementing strong interventions immediately to impede COVID-19 outbreak for Heilongjiang province. Implementation of stronger interventions to lower mutual contacts could accelerate the complete recovery from coronavirus infections in Heilongjiang province. Collectively, our model has characterized the epidemic of COVID-19 in Heilongjiang province and implied that strongly controlled measured should be taken for infected and asymptomatic patients to minimize total infections.",covid
"Background: Myriad manifestations of cardiovascular involvement have been described in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but there have been no reports of COVID-19 affecting the cardiac conduction system. The PR interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) normally shortens with increasing heart rate (HR). The case of a patient with COVID-19 manifesting Mobitz type 1 atrioventricular (AV) block that normalized as the patient's condition improved prompted us to investigate PR interval behavior in patients with COVID-19. Objective: The purpose of this study was to characterize PR interval behavior in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and to correlate that behavior with clinical outcomes. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional cohort analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases (March 26, 2020, to April 25, 2020). We reviewed pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 ECGs to characterize AV conduction by calculating the PR interval to HR (PR:HR) slope. Clinical endpoints were death or need for endotracheal intubation. Results: ECGs from 75 patients (246 pre-COVID-19 ECGs and 246 COVID-19 ECGs) were analyzed for PR:HR slope. Of these patients, 38 (50.7%) showed the expected PR interval shortening with increasing HR (negative PR:HR slope), whereas 37 (49.3%) showed either no change (8 with PR:HR slope = 0) or paradoxical PR interval prolongation (29 with positive PR:HR slope) with increasing HR. Patients without PR interval shortening were more likely to die (11/37 [29.7%] vs 3/38 [7.9%]; P = .019) or require endotracheal intubation (16/37 [43.2%] vs 8/38 [21.1%]; P = .05) compared to patients with PR interval shortening. Conclusion: Half of patients with COVID-19 showed abnormal PR interval behavior (paradoxical prolongation or lack of shortening) with increasing HR. This finding was associated with increased risk of death and need for endotracheal intubation.",covid
"How do retail investors respond to the outbreak of COVID-19? We use transaction-level trading data to show that investors significantly increase their trading activities as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, both at the extensive and at the intensive margin. Investors, on average, increase their brokerage deposits and open more new accounts. The average weekly trading intensity increases by 13.9% as the number of COVID-19 cases doubles. The increase in trading is especially pronounced for male and older investors, and affects stock and index trading. Following the 9.99%-drop of the Dow Jones on March 12, investors significantly reduce the usage of leverage.",covid
"Despite anticipated increased risk of COVID-19 and increased expression of the SARS CoV-2 receptor (ACE2), the relatively low mortality of pregnant women with COVID-19 has been an area of wonder. The immunological changes predominantly inclining to anti-inflammatory state, which is augmented by placental hormones' immune modulating action, looks against with COVID-19 inflammatory reaction leading to cytokine storm and multiple organ failure. Unlike many other viral infections, the bilateral immune activation of COVID-19 may preferentially make pregnant women at low risk. Taking the physiological advantage of pregnant women, potential clinical trials are proposed. Quite a large number of epidemiological and obstetrics related studies have addressed the cases of women with COVID-19. However, to the best of the author's knowledge, little is done to explore the physiological internal milieu of pregnant women in relation to COVID-19. This review provides an insight into how the hormonal and immunological changes in pregnancy potentially reduce SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammatory response.",covid
"Background and objectives: The daily incidence and deaths of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the USA are poorly understood. Internet search interest was found to be correlated with COVID-19 daily incidence in China, but has not yet been applied to the USA. Therefore, we examined the association of internet search-interest with COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths in the USA. Methods: We extracted COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths in the USA from two population-based datasets, namely 1-point-3-acres.com and the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data repository. The internet search-interest of COVID-19-related terms was obtained using Google Trends. The Pearson correlation test and general linear model were used to examine correlations and predict trends, respectively. Results: There were 636,282 new cases and,325 deaths of COVID-19 in the USA from March 1 to April 15, 2020, with a crude mortality of 4.45%. The daily new cases peaked at 35,098 cases on April 10, 2020 and the daily deaths peaked at 2,494 on April 15, 2020. The search interest of COVID, ""COVID pneumonia"" and ""COVID heart"" were correlated with COVID-19 daily incidence, with 12 or 14 days of delay (Pearson's r = 0.978, 0.978 and 0.979, respectively) and deaths with 19 days of delay (Pearson's r = 0.963, 0.958 and 0.970, respectively). The 7-day follow-up with prospectively collected data showed no significant correlations of the observed data with the predicted daily new cases or daily deaths, using search interest of COVID, COVID heart, and COVID pneumonia. Conclusions: Search terms related to COVID-19 are highly correlated with the COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths in the USA.",covid
"Background: In COVID-19 cases, hyper inflammation is associated with the severity of the disease. High levels of circulating cytokines were reported in severe COVID-19 patients. Neopterin produced by macrophages on stimulation with interferon-gamma, which is an important cytokine in the anti-viral immune response, hence it can be used to predict the severity of disease in COVID-19 cases. Objectives: In this study, it was aimed to determine the prognostic value of the neopterin for the prediction of severe disease in patients with COVID-19. Study design: This single-center, prospective study was conducted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers. Severe and mild COVID-19 cases were compared in terms of clinical and laboratory findings as well as serum neopterin levels on hospital admission. To assess the prognostic utility of neopterin between the severe and mild COVID-19 groups, a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Results: The median serum neopterin level was 4 times higher in COVID-19 patients than the healthy controls (46 vs. 12 nmol/L; p<0.001). The AUC value of serum neopterin was 0.914 (95% CI; 0.85 to 0.97). The sensitivity and specificity of serum neopterin for the cut-off value of 90 nmol / L to identify severe COVID-19 cases were 100 % and 76 %, respectively. Conclusions: Serum neopterin levels on hospitalization were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 disease than mild COVID-19 patients. Neopterin levels can be used as an early prognostic biomarker for COVID-19 on admission. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",covid
"In late March 2020, we faced a nosocomial outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at Keio University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. Presently, COVID-19 is an unprecedented worldwide biohazard, and a nosocomial outbreak can occur in any hospital at any time. Therefore, we reviewed the literature regarding hospital preparedness, the initial management of COVID-19, and the surveillance of healthcare workers (HCWs) to find information that would be generally useful for physicians when confronted with COVID-19. In terms of hospital preparedness, each hospital should develop an incident management system and establish a designated multidisciplinary medical team. To initiate case management, COVID-19 should be suspected based on patient symptoms and/or high-risk history and then should be confirmed by viral testing, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Although some patients will become critically ill, the guidelines for respiratory failure and septic shock for non-COVID-19 cases can be followed for supportive treatment. Antiviral medications should be carefully selected because the available information is confused by the large volume of preprint literature and unreliable data. HCWs who have come into contact with patients with COVID-19 can generate new in-hospital clusters of COVID-19 cases. Quarantine following contact tracking with risk stratification is effective in preventing transmission, and the essentials of medical surveillance include monitoring different types of symptoms, delegation of supervision, and continuation of surveillance regardless of the RT-PCR results. Preparation for COVID-19 is recommended before the first COVID-19 case is encountered.",covid
"The initial investigation by local hospital attributed the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to pneumonia with unknown cause that appeared like the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to several countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel estimation approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the spread of the disease through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predicted the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study revealed that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We found a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship was confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence revealed that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by ~0.10%-~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirmed the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases. Yet, the role of such a medium that facilitates the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear. We highlight safety precaution and preventive measures to circumvent the human-to-human transmission.",covid
"This study validated a 10-item COVID-19 Burnout Scale (COVID-19-BS) to measure burnout associated with COVID-19. Participants were 402 Turkish adults (76.4% female; Meanage = 27.37 ± 8.90). Factor analytic approach yielded a one-factor solution, with high internal consistency reliability. Mediation analysis showed that COVID-19 stress predicted resilience and COVID-19 burnout. Resilience predicted COVID-19 burnout. The relationship between COVID-19 burnout and COVID-19 stress was partially mediated by resilience. Findings suggest that the COVID-19-BS is a psychometrically sound scale to measure burnout related to COVID-19. Findings also elucidate our understanding of the role of resilience in the relationship between stress and burnout related to COVID-19.",covid
"Aim of this work is to explore authorship patterns in COVID-19 case reports. As of August 2020, i.e. 6 months after the first COVID-19 publication was released, more than 40000 articles have been published in Medline, the 1552 being indexed as case reports (COVID Group). During the same period, a Medline search for case reports about infectious diseases excluding COVID-19 (ID Group), identified 496 publications. The two groups were compared in terms of authorship. COVID-19 case reports had a mean of 6.1 authors per manuscript (median 5, SD 3.8), compared to 6.2 (median 5, SD 3.3) in the other group (p = .43). The COVID-19 group had 51 cases (3.3%) authored from 15 or more authors, compared to 1.4% (7 cases) in the ID group (p = .03). Fourteen percent of all COVID-19 case reports have 10 or more authors and 13 manuscripts (1%) have been authored by 20 or more persons. We conclude that COVID-19 case reports reflect the modern trend of authorship proliferation with two-page case reports being authored from >15 scientists.",covid
"Purpose: No information is available on cancer patients' knowledge of and experiences with COVID-19. We undertook an evaluation of differences in COVID-19 symptom occurrence rates, COVID-19 testing rates, clinical care activities, knowledge of COVID-19, and use of mitigation procedures between patients who were and were not receiving active cancer treatment. Methods: Patients enrolled were > 18 years of age; had a diagnosis of cancer; and were able to complete the emailed study survey online. Results: Of the 174 patients who participated, 27.6% (n = 48) were receiving active treatment, 13.6% were unemployed because of COVID-19, 12.2% had been tested for COVID-19, and 0.6% had been hospitalized for COVID-19. Patients who were not on active treatment reported a higher mean number of COVID-19 symptoms (3.1 (± 4.2) versus 1.9 (± 2.6)), and patients who reported a higher number of COVID-19 symptoms were more likely to be tested. Over 55% of the patients were confident that their primary care provider could diagnose COVID-19, and the majority of the patients had high levels of adherence with the use of precautionary measures (e.g., social distancing, use of face coverings). Conclusion: The high level of COVID-19 symptoms and the significant overlap of COVID-19 and cancer-related symptoms pose challenges for clinicians who are assessing and triaging oncology patients for COVID-19 testing. For patients on active treatment, clinicians face challenges with how to assess and manage symptoms that, prior to COVID-19, would be ascribed to acute toxicities associated with cancer treatments or persistent symptoms in cancer survivors.",covid

"Aplastic anemia (AA) is a type of anemia that is caused by an intrinsic defect of hematopoietic progenitors or an extrinsic immune mediated destruction of stem cells. Patients commonly presented with pancytopenia, particularly leukopenia that renders patient susceptible to various infections. COVID-19 is one of these infections that could be life threatening and highly contagious. Infection with COVID-19 is expected in a patient who developed fever, respiratory manifestations, leukopenia and lymphopenia together with history suggestive of exposure to infection. Furthermore COVID-19 was found associated with thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis and monocytopenia in severe cases. Thus the relationship between COVID-19 infection and AA would be a vicious circle as both cause leukopenia and lymphopenia. This study aimed to break this circle, through proposing risk stratification of vulnerability to COVID-19 in AA patients who were admitted in our institution in the period from Mar. 2018 to Mar. 2020 followed by a strict preventive plan tailored for each risk group. 79% of AA patients were at high risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection if exposed. This group of patients have to be targeted with more aggressive preventive plan than normal healthy persons. In conclusion this study proposed next step in combating COVID-19 infection through mass survey of high risk people then application of specific precautions to them, perhaps they could be candidate for future vaccine or prophylactic treatment.",covid
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19) has produced an unprecedented global pandemic. Though the death rate from COVID-19 infection is ∼2%, many infected people recover at home. Among patients for whom COVID-19 is deadly are those with pre-existing comorbidities. Therefore, identification of populations at highest risk of COVID-19 mortality could significantly improve the capacity of healthcare providers to take early action and minimize the possibility of overwhelming care centers, which in turn would save many lives. Although several approaches have been used/developed (or are being developed/suggested) to diagnose COVID-19 infection, no approach is available/proposed for fast diagnosis of COVID-19 infections likely to be fatal. The central aim of this short perspective is to suggest a few possible nanobased technologies (i.e., protein corona sensor array and magnetic levitation) that could discriminate COVID-19-infected people while still in the early stages of infection who are at high risk of death. Such discrimination technologies would not only be useful in protecting health care centers from becoming overwhelmed but would also provide a powerful tool to better control possible future pandemics with a less social and economic burden.",covid
"Objectives: To provide a descriptive analysis of communities severely impacted by COVID-19 to that of communities moderately affected by COVID-19, with an emphasis on the social determinant factors within them. Methods: To compare the communities with extremely high COVID-19 rates to that of communities with moderate COVID-19 cases, we selected six community districts in Queens, New York using public data from New York City Health Department that provides the percentage of positive COVID-19 cases by zip codes from March 1st, 2020 to April 17th, 2020. Results: The results of the study showed that COVID-19 cases were 30% greater in communities with extremely high cases than in communities with moderate cases. There were also the several outstanding social determinants commonalities that were found in communities with extremely high COVID-19 cases. These include severe overcrowding, lower educational status, less access to healthcare, and more chronic diseases. Conclusion: This study adds to existing literature on vulnerable urban communities affected by COVID-19. Future studies should focus on the underlying factors in each social determinant discussed in this study to better understand its association with the spread of COVID-19.",covid
"The reports suggesting a beneficial effect of nicotine on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity may encourage smoking. We aimed to analyze tweets on COVID-19 and smoking coming from casual Twitter users and Twitter accounts representing the tobacco industry. We collected tweets on COVID-19 and smoking from January 1 to May 1, 2020, using Twitter application programming interface. We analyzed sentiment, likes, or retweet to followers ratios, and the posts coming from the casual users to find pieces of news that could affect the discourse. Tweets coming from industry were analyzed manually. We analyzed n = 33,890 tweets on COVID-19 and smoking. The sentiment of tweets was negative, hitting a nadir in mid-March, but became less negative in April when preprints suggesting benefits from smoking on COVID-19 were released. Similar trends were observed for the ratios of likes or retweets to followers. We found 58 messages from the tobacco industry concerning COVID-19. Twenty-two (37.9 percent) mentioned the efforts of tobacco companies to support the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Two tweets included Food and Drug Administration statements that there is no evidence that vaping increases the risk of COVID-19. The occurrence of preprints suggesting benefits of smoking in COVID-19 might increase sentiment and reactions to tweets on tobacco products and the virus. The authors of potentially controversial articles should restrain from the promotion of their results before the completion of the peer-review process. Twitter presents a convenient tool to monitor e-discourse during a health crisis. The research community should monitor the tobacco industry's social media.",covid
"Otorhinolaryngological manifestations are common among patients suffering from COVID-19. This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19 including disease transmission and clinical characteristics. This article aims to review the otolaryngologist experience treating patients in the cities where COVID 19 impact is most, and to propose appropriate protective measures while managing ENT patients. This is a retrospective study conducted in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Hind Institute of Medical Sciences, Ataria, Sitapur from 10 March 2020 to 4 May 2020. The most common otolaryngological symptoms of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness also seen in some of the patients. COVID-19 could also manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection as they cope with URT symptoms in OPD and while performing surgery in COVID-19 positive patients. Patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases. An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals. ENT surgeries should be postponed if not urgent.",covid
"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the greatest pandemic in modern history. Laboratory test alterations have been described in COVID-19 patients, but differences with other pneumonias have been poorly investigated to date, especially in Caucasian populations. The aim of this study was to investigate differences and prognostic potential of routine blood tests in a series of Italian patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia. Methodology: Clinical data and routine laboratory tests of a consecutive series of 30 COVID-19 patients and 30 age and sex matched patients with non COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia have been retrospectively collected. Differences in laboratory tests between patients with COVID-19 and non COVID-19 pneumonias have been investigated, as well as differences between COVID-19 survivors and non survivors. Results: COVID-19 patients had lower white blood cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and higher platelet counts. In addition, COVID-19 patients showed higher mean platelet volume, lower C reactive protein concentrations, and higher De Ritis ratio. Combined blood cell indexes of systemic inflammation were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients. In further analysis of the COVID-19 group, the neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR, systemic inflammation response index and De Ritis ratio, were significantly higher in non survivors than in survivors, while the number of platelets was significantly lower in non survivors. Conclusions: Our study showed several alterations in blood cell populations and indexes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in comparison with patients with non COVID-19 pneumonia. Some of these indexes showed promising prognostic abilities. Further studies are necessary to confirm these results.",covid
"Background: With the pandemic of COVID-19 and the release of related policies, discussions about the COVID-19 are widespread online. Social media becomes a reliable source for understanding public opinions toward this virus outbreak. Objective: This study aims to explore public opinions toward COVID-19 on social media by comparing the differences in sentiment changes and discussed topics between California and New York in the United States. Methods: A dataset with COVID-19-related Twitter posts was collected from March 5, 2020 to April 2, 2020 using Twitter streaming API. After removing any posts unrelated to COVID-19, as well as posts that contain promotion and commercial information, two individual datasets were created based on the geolocation tags with tweets, one containing tweets from California state and the other from New York state. Sentiment analysis was conducted to obtain the sentiment score for each COVID-19 tweet. Topic modeling was applied to identify top topics related to COVID-19. Results: While the number of COVID-19 cases increased more rapidly in New York than in California in March 2020, the number of tweets posted has a similar trend over time in both states. COVID-19 tweets from California had more negative sentiment scores than New York. There were some fluctuations in sentiment scores in both states over time, which might correlate with the policy changes and the severity of COVID-19 pandemic. The topic modeling results showed that the popular topics in both California and New York states are similar, with ""protective measures"" as the most prevalent topic associated with COVID-19 in both states. Conclusions: Twitter users from California had more negative sentiment scores towards COVID-19 than Twitter users from New York. The prevalent topics about COVID-19 discussed in both states were similar with some slight differences.",covid
"Importance: COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus that uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2) receptor to gain entry into cells. ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in multiple organs, including the retina, an extension of the central nervous system. The ACE2 receptor is involved in the diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy. Additionally, coronaviruses cause ocular infections in animals, including retinitis, and optic neuritis. Objective: To assess whether there is any retinal disease associated with COVID-19. Design: We have evaluated 27 asymptomatic subjects, with retinal fundoscopic, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography fourteen days after hospital discharge due to COVID-19 bilateral pneumonia. Results: Cotton wool exudates were evident in six out of 27 patients evaluated, a 22%. Cotton wool exudates are a marker vascular disease severity in other medical context, that is diabetes and hypertension, and are associated with increased risk for acute vascular events. Whether antiaggregation therapy may play a role on fundoscopic-selected patients with COVID-19 requires prospective trials.",covid
"Background: The first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection was detected in Wuhan, fever and respiratory symptoms have been frequently reported in patients infected with this virus. Aim: It was aimed to compare the symptoms of patients with COVID-19 positivity and patients without COVID-19 positivity hospitalized with suspicion of COVID-19. Methods: Patients presenting to the Sakarya University Training and Research Hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 were included in the study. Samples were obtained from the patients and PCR tests were performed; the patients were grouped as COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative; these two groups were questioned for 15 symptoms and the results were compared. Results: A total of 297 patients with suspicion of COVID-19 were included in the study. COVID-19 was positive in 143 patients and negative in 154 patients. The most common symptoms in the COVID-19 positive group were: cough (56.6%), weakness (56.6%), taste disorder (35.7%), myalgia (34.3%), and fever (33.6%); and in the COVID-19 negative group: cough (63%), weakness (45.5%), dyspnea (29.9%), headache (27.3%) and fever (24.7%). When these two groups were compared, taste disorder, smell disorder and diarrhea were significantly higher in the COVID-19 positive group (p = <0,00001, p = 0,00001 and p = 0,02). Conclusion: Our study showed that taste and smell disorders and diarrhea were important markers in COVID-19 infection.",covid
"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally since December 2019. Twitter is a popular social media platform with active discussions about the COVID-19 pandemic. The public reactions on Twitter about the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries have not been studied. This study aims to compare the public reactions towards the COVID-19 pandemic between the United Kingdom and the United States from March 6, 2020 to April 2, 2020. Data: The numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom and the United States were obtained from the 1Point3Acres website. Twitter data were collected using COVID-19 related keywords from March 6, 2020 to April 2, 2020. Methods: Temporal analyses were performed on COVID-19 related Twitter posts (tweets) during the study period to show daily trends and hourly trends. The sentiment scores of the tweets on COVID-19 were analyzed and associated with the policy announcements and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Topic modeling was conducted to identify related topics discussed with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and the United States. Results: The number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom was significantly lower than that in the United States during our study period. There were 3,556,442 COVID-19 tweets in the United Kingdom and 16,280,065 tweets in the United States during the study period. The number of COVID-19 tweets per 10,000 Twitter users in the United Kingdom was lower than that in the United States. The sentiment scores of COVID-19 tweets in the United Kingdom were less negative than those in the United States. The topics discussed in COVID-19 tweets in the United Kingdom were mostly about the gratitude to government and health workers, while the topics in the United States were mostly about the global COVID-19 pandemic situation. Conclusion: Our study showed correlations between the public reactions towards the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter and the confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as the policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom and the United States.",covid
"Grounded in the vast changes to work life (jobs) and home life that people are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic (hereinafter COVID), this article presents five research directions related to COVID's impacts on jobs-i.e., job loss, job changes, job outcomes, coping, and support-and five research directions related to COVID's impact on home life-i.e., home life changes, children, life-related outcomes, social life, and support. In addition to this, I discuss overarching possible research directions and considerations for researchers, editors, and reviewers, as we continue our scientific journey to support people through this pandemic and beyond. I organize these directions and considerations into two sets of five each: focal groups that should be studied-i.e., underprivileged populations, different countries and cultural contexts, women (vs. men), workers in healthcare (frontline workers), elderly and at-risk-and five general issues and special considerations-i.e., role of technology as the oxygen, pre- vs. mid- vs. post-COVID studies, constraints on data collection/research due to COVID, evolution of COVID, and focus on contextualization (generalizability is irrelevant).",covid
"Objective: Considering the rising menace of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is essential to explore the methods and resources that might predict the case numbers expected and identify the locations of outbreaks. Hence, we have done the following study to explore the potential use of Google Trends (GT) in predicting the COVID-19 outbreak in India. Methods: The Google search terms used for the analysis were ""coronavirus"", ""COVID"", ""COVID 19"", ""corona"", and ""virus"". GTs for these terms in Google Web, News, and YouTube, and the data on COVID-19 case numbers were obtained. Spearman correlation and lag correlation were used to determine the correlation between COVID-19 cases and the Google search terms. Results: ""Coronavirus"" and ""corona"" were the terms most commonly used by Internet surfers in India. Correlation for the GTs of the search terms ""coronavirus"" and ""corona"" was high (r > 0.7) with the daily cumulative and new COVID-19 cases for a lag period ranging from 9 to 21 days. The maximum lag period for predicting COVID-19 cases was found to be with the News search for the term ""coronavirus"", with 21 days, i.e., the search volume for ""coronavirus"" peaked 21 days before the peak number of cases reported by the disease surveillance system. Conclusion: Our study revealed that GTs may predict outbreaks of COVID-19, 2 to 3 weeks earlier than the routine disease surveillance, in India. Google search data may be considered as a supplementary tool in COVID-19 monitoring and planning in India.",covid
"Objectives: This paper seeks to: provide an overview of the impacts of and responses to the spread of COVID-19 in Ireland; assess the vulnerability of the population living in rural areas to COVID-19; compare the health status of male farmers to underlying medical conditions frequently associated with those experiencing the worst impacts of the illness; and assess the implications of COVID-19 for farmers living alone and farm households with children. Methods: We present an overview of the impact and response to COVID-19 through the use of public health statistics and reference to policy documents. We subsequently draw on the results of ongoing geographic and health research to present an overview of the impacts and potential implications of COVID-19. Results: The population of many rural areas and farmers in particular are highly vulnerable to adverse outcomes to COVID-19 infection. Single person farm households are at particular risk of isolation, whilst those families with children are at increased risk of stress. Conclusions: There is an urgent need to address both COVID-19 challenges and the health and wellbeing issues confronting farmers and farm families arising out of the current pandemic by supporting these populations adopt and sustain health behaviour changes, improve their wellbeing and develop the resources that support resilience.",covid
"Background: Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the mental health of the people all around the world is severely disrupted. Aim: The purpose of this study is to identify whether 'Fear of COVID-19' impacted on future workforces' career anxiety at the first place and whether depression from COVID-19 has any indirect effect on 'Fear of COVID-19' and future workforces' career anxiety. Method: Based on three different scales related to 'Fear of COVID-19', depression and career anxiety, a structured questionnaire was developed and the survey data was collected for this study. Results: The empirical result of the study reveals that, due to the outbreak of COVID-19 fear, the future workforce is getting anxious about their future career. Again, depression from COVID-19, caused by 'Fear of COVID-19', as a mediator, has a significant indirect impact on the relationship between 'Fear of COVID-19' and future career anxiety, resulting in a full mediation. This means, due to the outbreak of 'Fear of COVID-19' people are becoming depressed and anxious about their future career which is creating a long-term negative effect on human psychology. Conclusion: These research findings will be a major tool for the policymakers, as well as the human resource planning professionals, to sketch plans after COVID-19 pandemic. This study is a novel work combining the concepts of fear and depression with career anxiety in a pandemic situation like COVID-19, and also assists future researchers in many folds.",covid
"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has put restriction of travel, and social distancing has become a new normal. This outbreak of the pandemic has made telemedicine more relevant than ever. The objective of this study is to identify the factors affecting the rate of adoption of telemedicine and effect of the COVID-19 on these factors. The research develops five hypotheses to test the influence of a disease outbreak on the rate of telemedicine adoption. The method used for the study is the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the sampling method used for the study is purposive sampling. The respondents were taken from a multispecialty clinic in North India and the sample size for the study is 43. The study concludes that patients are seeing more value in the use of telemedicine during COVID-19. They are more willing to experiment with telemedicine and are not intimidated by the technology related to telemedicine.",covid
"Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has shaken the existence of mankind worldwide, including that of New Zealand. In comparison to other countries, New Zealand has had a very low number of confirmed and probable cases as well as COVID-19-related deaths. New Zealand closed its borders and rapidly declared a stringent lockdown to eliminate COVID-19. The country's 'go hard, go early' policy serves as an exemplar for the rest of the world to date. The mysterious nature of COVID-19 has caused tremendous stress and uncertainty leading to universal conflict between public health and state economy. Mental health services and non-government organisations have been proactive in the fight against COVID-19. Though there has been no significant rise in referrals to secondary mental health services to date (4 May 2020), a rapid surge in mental health presentations is widely anticipated. Telehealth may prove to be an efficient and cost-effective tool for the provision of future health services.",covid
"Corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic caused by novel coronavirus. COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the world. The gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. However, the facility for RT-PCR test is limited, which causes early diagnosis of the disease difficult. Easily available modalities like X-ray can be used to detect specific symptoms associated with COVID-19. Pre-trained convolutional neural networks are widely used for computer-aided detection of diseases from smaller datasets. This paper investigates the effectiveness of multi-CNN, a combination of several pre-trained CNNs, for the automated detection of COVID-19 from X-ray images. The method uses a combination of features extracted from multi-CNN with correlation based feature selection (CFS) technique and Bayesnet classifier for the prediction of COVID-19. The method was tested using two public datasets and achieved promising results on both the datasets. In the first dataset consisting of 453 COVID-19 images and 497 non-COVID images, the method achieved an AUC of 0.963 and an accuracy of 91.16%. In the second dataset consisting of 71 COVID-19 images and 7 non-COVID images, the method achieved an AUC of 0.911 and an accuracy of 97.44%. The experiments performed in this study proved the effectiveness of pre-trained multi-CNN over single CNN in the detection of COVID-19.",covid
"Background and objective: The covid-19 pandemic especially affects cancer patients with higher incidence and mortality according to published series of original pandemic foci. The study aims to determine the mortality in our center due to covid-19 in cancer patients during the first 3 weeks of the epidemic. Material and methods: The cancer patients who died of covid-19 during the analysis period have been reviewed describing the oncological and the covid-19 infection characteristics and the treatments established. Results: Confirmed cases covid-19: 1069 with 132 deaths (12.3%). With cancer 36 patients (3.4%), 15 deceased (41.6%). Of the deceased, only 6 patients (40%) were in active treatment. The most frequent associated tumor was lung (8/15 patients, 53.3%), 11 with metastatic disease (11/15, 73.3%). No specific treatment was established in 40% (6/15) of the patients. The rest of them received treatments with the active protocols. Conclusion: Covid-19 mortality in cancer patients is almost four times higher than that of the general population. Until we have effective treatments or an effective vaccine, the only possibility to protect our patients is to prevent the infection with the appropriate measures.",covid
"Objective: Comorbid conditions are associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19. Registry data show that patients with cirrhosis may be at high risk. However, outcome comparisons among patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 versus patients with COVID-19 alone and cirrhosis alone are lacking. The aim of this study was to perform these comparisons. Design: A multicentre study of inpatients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 compared with age/gender-matched patients with COVID-19 alone and cirrhosis alone was performed. COVID-19 and cirrhosis characteristics, development of organ failures and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and mortality (inpatient death+hospice) were compared. Results: 37 patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 were matched with 108 patients with COVID-19 and 127 patients with cirrhosis from seven sites. Race/ethnicity were similar. Patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had higher mortality compared with patients with COVID-19 (30% vs 13%, p=0.03) but not between patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 and patients with cirrhosis (30% vs 20%, p=0.16). Patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 versus patients with COVID-19 alone had equivalent respiratory symptoms, chest findings and rates of intensive care unit transfer and ventilation. However, patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had worse Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI 6.5±3.1 vs 3.3±2.5, p<0.001), lower presenting GI symptoms and higher lactate. Patients with cirrhosis alone had higher cirrhosis-related complications, maximum model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and lower BiPAP/ventilation requirement compared with patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19, but CCI and ACLF rates were similar. In the entire group, CCI (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37, p<0.0001) was the only variable predictive of mortality on multivariable regression. Conclusions: In this multicentre North American contemporaneously enrolled study, age/gender-matched patients with cirrhosis+COVID-19 had similar mortality compared with patients with cirrhosis alone but higher than patients with COVID-19 alone. CCI was the only independent mortality predictor in the entire matched cohort.",covid
"Over the course of the new coronavirus infectious disease (coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19) pandemic, our social situation has been changing dramatically, in addition to the substantial efforts made for the early and appropriate management of COVID-19 and preventing this infection spreading. Recently, neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 have been shown to be not uncommon, with headaches receiving attention as one of the main neurological symptoms. The frequency of headaches associated with COVID-19 ranged from 5.6% to 70.3%, based on 21 clinical studies and 8 meta-analyses. However, headaches were observed in 11.1% to 81.0% of non-COVID-19 individuals, including healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. Although detailed descriptions of headaches were rarely provided in the literature obtained, in this article, I wil discuss the frequency and characteristics of headaches, and the pathophysiology of headaches as it relateds to COVID-19.",covid
"Background: While recent reports suggest that people with disabilities (PwDs) are likely to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and face multiple challenges, previous research has not examined if COVID-19 burdens are unequally distributed with respect to the disability characteristics of the U.S. Objective: This article presents the first national scale study of the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and disability characteristics in the U.S. The objective is to determine whether COVID-19 incidence is significantly greater in counties containing higher percentages of socio-demographically disadvantaged PwDs, based on race, ethnicity, poverty status, age, and biological sex. Methods: This study integrates county-level data on confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering database with multiple disability variables from the 2018 American Community Survey. Statistical analyses are based on bivariate correlations and multivariate generalized estimating equations that consider spatial clustering in the data. Results: Greater COVID-19 incidence rate is significantly associated with: (1) higher percentages of PwDs who are Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, below poverty, under 18 years of age, and female; and (2) lower percentages of PwDs who are non-Hispanic White, above poverty, aged 65 or more years, and male, after controlling for spatial clustering. Conclusions: Socio-demographically disadvantaged PwDs are significantly overrepresented in counties with higher COVID-19 incidence compared to other PwDs. These findings represent an important starting point for more detailed investigation of the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on PwDs and highlight the urgent need for COVID-19 data collection systems to incorporate disability information.",covid
"Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. There is sudden need of statistical modeling due to onset of COVID-19 pandemic across the world. But health planning and policy requirements need the estimates of disease problem from clinical data. Objective: The present study aimed to predict the declination of COVID-19 using recovery rate and case load rate on basis of available data from India. Methods: The reported COVID-19 cases in the country were obtained from website (https://datahub.io/core/covid-19#resource-covid-19_zip/). The confirmed cases, recovered cases and deaths were used for estimating recovery rate, case load rate and death rate till June 04, 2020. Results: A total of 216919 confirmed cases were reported nationwide in India on June 04, 2020. It is found that the recovery rate increased to 47.99% and case load rate decreased to 49.21%. Death rate is found to be very low 2.80%. Accordingly, coincidence of the difference of case load rate and recovery rate (delta) will reveal a declination in expected COVID-19 cases. Conclusion: The epidemic in the country was mainly caused by the movement of people from various foreign countries to India. Lockdown as restricting the migration of population and decision taken by the government to quarantine the population may greatly reduce the risk of continued spread of the epidemic in India. This study predicts that when the case load rate gets lesser than recovery rate, there after COVID-19 patients would be started to decline.",covid
"Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic, overwhelming health care systems around the world. Hospitals around the world, including the United States, have been struggling to adapt to the influx of patients with COVID-19, the illness caused by SARS-CoV2, given limited resources and high demand for medical care. Objectives: This article seeks to provide emergency physicians with a guide to sonographic findings in COVID-19 and an algorithm by which point-of-care lung ultrasound may assist emergency physicians caring for these patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Discussion: The studies currently being published have established a typical set of ultrasound findings in COVID-19. Point-of-care lung ultrasound is rapid and accessible in most emergency departments in the United States, and even in many resource-poor settings. Conclusion: Point-of-care ultrasound provides numerous benefits to emergency providers caring for patients with COVID-19, including decreasing resource utilization, assisting in diagnosis, guiding management of the critically ill patient, and aiding in rapid triage of patients under investigations for COVID-19.",covid
"This manuscript reviews the current state of knowledge about the burden of mental illness and assesses the impact of COVID-19 illness on mental health in Pakistan. For this we analyzed secondary data obtained from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study draws from a wide range of data sources to quantify global and regional effects of a disease. We also did a literature search on the effects of COVID-19 illness on mental health and the psychosocial effects of COVID-19 and other Corona virus related illnesses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Data from the studies obtained was utilized to extrapolate the anticipated effects of COVID-19 illness on healthcare workers, COVID-19 patients and the general public in Pakistan. Mental illness poses a significant challenge to Pakistan's under resourced health care system. COVID-19 has the potential to strain Pakistan's healthcare system to the breaking point. So far, the general morbidity from COVID-19 illness in Pakistan has been low compared to other countries but this could change in the coming weeks and months. Hidden within this crisis are also some opportunities for both healthcare and education.",covid
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated significantly worse outcomes for Minority (Black and Hispanic) individuals. Understanding the reasons for COVID-19-related disparities among asthma patients has important public health implications. Objective: To determine factors contributing to health disparities in those with asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An anonymous survey was sent through social media to adult patients with asthma, and a separate survey was sent to physicians who provide asthma care. The patient survey addressed demographic information including socioeconomic status (SES), asthma control, and attitudes/health behaviors during COVID-19. Results: A total of 1171 patients (10.1% Minority individuals) and 225 physicians completed the survey. Minority patients were more likely to have been affected by COVID-19 (e.g., became unemployed, lived in a community with high COVID-19 cases). They had worse asthma control (increased emergency visits for asthma, lower ACT score), were more likely to live in urban areas, and had a lower household income. Initial differences in attitudes and health behaviors disappeared after controlling for baseline demographic features. Institutional racism was demonstrated by findings that Minority individuals were less likely to have a primary care physician, had more trouble affording asthma medications due to COVID-19, were more likely to have lost health insurance due to COVID-19, and that 25% of physicians found it more challenging to care for Black individuals with asthma during COVID-19. Conclusion: Differences in SES and the effects of institutional racism, but not health behaviors, sources of information, or attitudes, are playing a role in disparities seen for asthma patients during COVID-19.",covid

"COVID-19's daily increasing cases and deaths have led to worldwide lockdown, quarantine and some restrictions. This study aims to analyze the effect of lockdown days on the spread of coronavirus in countries. COVID-19 cases and lockdown days data were collected for 49 countries that implemented the lockdown between certain dates (without interruption). The correlation tests were used for data analysis based on unconstrained (normal) and constrained (Tukey-lambda). The lockdown days was significantly correlated with COVID-19 pandemic based on unconstrained (r = -0.9126, F-ratio = 6.1654; t-ratio = 2.40; prob > .0203 with 49 observations) and based on Tukey-lambda (r = 0.7402, λ = 0.14). The lockdown, one of the social isolation restrictions, has been observed to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, and showed that the spread of the virus can be significantly reduced by this preventive restriction in this study. This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lockdown. The application of lockdown by governments is also thought to be effective on psychology, environment and economy besides having impact on Covid-19.",covid
"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. With a mortality rate reaching up to 5%, healthcare professionals treating patients with COVID-19 are at a significantly higher risk for exposure themselves. Given the rapidly progressing rate of COVID-19, there is an urgent need for developing guidelines within each specialty. This article discusses guidelines specifically for anesthesiologists dealing with ophthalmic surgeries with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Anesthesiologists always work in the proximity of the patient's face while performing either ocular regional anesthesia or while managing the airway in the process of intubation/extubation. Within these guidelines, the emphasis is provided on thorough preoperative screening to identify COVID-19 patients and to prevent the exposure of healthcare staff by following standard personal protective equipment (PPE) precautions.",covid
"Background: Since the first occurrence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), a number of online tools have become available to assist with tracking Covid-19 prevalence. Yet we are unaware of resources that provide country-specific Covid-19 incidence data. Methods: We undertook a descriptive analysis of the global impact of Covid-19 using data reported on March 17, 2020. The prevalence of Covid-19 cases, fatalities attributed to Covid-19, and the case fatality rate for each of the 238 countries were accessed from the World Health Organization global Covid-19 tracking site, and we additionally calculated Covid-19 incidence based on country-specific population data. We determined the country-specific point prevalence and incidence of Covid-19 and associated deaths while using geocoded data to display their spatial distribution with geographic heat maps. Results: The analysis included 193,197 Covid-19 cases and 7859 associated deaths. The point prevalence was highest in China (80,881), Italy (31,506), Iran (16,169), and Spain (11,312); no other country reported more than 10,000 cases. The incidence (per million population) was highest in San Marino (3389) followed by Iceland (645) and Italy (521); no other country had an incidence above 400 per million population. Conclusion: Countries with a high Covid-19 prevalence may not have a high incidence, and vice versa. Public health agencies that provide real-time infection tracking tools should report country-specific Covid-19 incidence metrics, in addition to prevalence data.",covid
"Introduction: Influenza virus pneumonia and COVID-19 are two different types of respiratory viral pneumonia but with very similar clinical manifestations. The aim of the present study was to help clinicians gain a better understanding about differences between Influenza virus pneumonia and COVID-19 by comparative analysis of the early-stage clinical features. Methods: Clinical data of patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and influenza A pneumonia identified in our hospital were collected and analyzed retrospectively to identify the clinical features that could differentiate between the two types of viral pneumonia. Results: The two types of viral pneumonia mainly affected adults, especially people over 50 years, with no gender difference between them. Fever, cough, sputum and muscle soreness were the most common symptoms of COVID-19. Some patients with COVID-19 may also exhibit digestive tract symptoms. Elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) was a more common phenomenon in patients with COVID-19 than that in patients with influenza A H1N1 virus pneumonia. In addition, eosinophil count was decreased and the monocyte percentage was increased in COVID-19 patients. The grid-form shadow was a typical presentation of COVID-19 on the lung CT image, and the disease usually progressed quickly within a week. Conclusion: Influenza pneumonia and COVID-19 are two different types of respiratory viral pneumonia with very similar clinical manifestations. The percentage of monocytes is increased and the eosinophil count is decreased in COVID-19. Glass-ground density exudation shadow located peripherally is the typical sign of COVID-19 on the lung CT image, and the shadow often with grid-form sign. These features may not be typically observed in patients with influenza pneumonia. Chest CT scan combined with nucleic acid detection is an effective and accurate method for diagnosing COVID-19. Blood routine test has a limited diagnostic value in differentiating the two forms of pneumonia.",covid
"Background: This study aimed to describe the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in surgical patients and medical staff. Methods: A single-center case series of 1586 consecutive surgical patients was selected at our hospital from January 13 to March 12, 2020. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were analyzed and followed up to May 20, 2020. The transmission of COVID-19 between the surgical patients and medical staff was also recorded. Results: Seventeen (1.07%) surgical patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with a high incidence in the thoracic department (9.37%), and the median age was 58 years (IQR, 53-73). The median time from hospital admission to COVID-19 diagnosis was 9.0 days (7.0-12.0) and was 6.0 days (4.0-7.0) from the day of surgery to COVID-19 diagnosis. Eleven (64.70%) patients suffered from pulmonary infection before surgery. When COVID-19 was diagnosed, common symptoms were fever (82.35%) and cough (94.12%), and most (82.35%) neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios were high (>3.5). Chest computed tomography (CT) (82.35%) showed bilateral dense shadows. Surgical patients with COVID-19 stayed in the hospital for approximately 35.0 days (25.5-43.0), with a mortality rate of 11.76%. Sixteen medical staff were infected with COVID-19 in the early stage. Conclusions: In this series of 1586 surgical patients, the COVID-19 infection rate was 1.07%, with an especially high incidence among patients with thoracic diseases. Middle-aged and elderly patients with preoperative pulmonary infection were more susceptible to COVID-19 infection after surgery. Medical staff were infected with COVID-19 and should take protective measures to protect themselves.",covid
"Background/purpose: Because of the spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019), preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors become important for individuals, especially those who are vulnerable. The present study proposes a model to explain the preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors among people with mental illness in Taiwan. Methods: A cross-sectional design was carried out and 414 patients with mental illness (230 males [55.6%]; mean age = 46.32 [SD = 10.86]) agreed to participate in the study. All the participants completed the Preventive COVID-19 Infection Behaviors Scale, Self-Stigma Scale-Short, Believing COVID-19 Information Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Regression models and structural equation modeling (SEM) were applied to examine the factors associated with preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors. Results: Both regression models and SEM showed that trust in COVID-19 information sources (standardized coefficient [β] = 0.211 in regression; β = 0.194 in SEM) and fear of COVID-19 (β = -0.128 in regression; β = -0.223 in SEM) significantly explained preventive behaviors among individuals with mental illness. The SEM further showed that fear of COVID-19 was significantly explained by trust in COVID-19 information sources (β = 0.220) and self-stigma (β = 0.454). Conclusions: Based on the results, healthcare providers should help individuals with mental illness reduce self-stigma and fear of COVID-19 which would consequently improve their preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors. Moreover, improving trust in COVID-19 information sources for individuals with mental illness may be another method to improve their preventive behaviors.",covid
"Objectives: One-fifth of Covid-19 patients suffer a severely symptomatic, hyperinflammatory course, but specific causes remain unclear. Mast cells (MCs) are activated by SARS-CoV-2. Though only recently recognized, MC activation syndrome (MCAS), usually due to acquired MC clonality, is a chronic multisystem disorder with inflammatory and allergic themes and estimated prevalence of 17%. We describe a novel conjecture explaining how MCAS might cause propensity for severe acute Covid-19 infection and chronic post-Covid-19 illnesses. Methods: Observations of Covid-19 illness in patients with/without MCAS, set against our extensive clinical experience with MCAS. Results: The prevalence of MCAS is concordant with the prevalence of severe cases within the Covid-19-infected population. Much of Covid-19's hyperinflammation is concordant with manners of inflammation which MC activation can drive. Drugs with activity against MCs or their mediators have been preliminarily observed helpful in Covid-19 patients. None of our treated MCAS patients who have endured Covid-19 infection have suffered severe courses of the infection, let alone mortality. Conclusions: Hyperinflammatory cytokine storms in many severely symptomatic Covid-19 patients may be rooted in aberrant response to SARS-CoV-2 by the dysfunctional MCs of MCAS rather than normal response by normal MCs. If provable, our conjecture has significant therapeutic and prognostic implications.",covid
"Clozapine is associated with haematological side effects, including neutropaenia, which can signal impending life-threatening agranulocytosis. Patients with COVID-19 infection frequently experience lymphopaenia, but not neutropaenia. We present 13 patients established on clozapine who developed COVID-19 infection. There were no significant differences in total white cell or neutrophil counts between pre-COVID-19, intra-COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 periods. We therefore suggest that patients who develop COVID-19 should generally have their clozapine treatment continued. Patients taking clozapine who develop neutroapaenia during COVID-19 infection should be investigated and monitored as in normal practice, because changes in neutrophil counts cannot be assumed to be due to the viral infection.",covid
"Objectives: Older adults may experience loneliness due to social distancing and isolation during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Loneliness may further catalyze numerous poor health outcomes including impaired sleep. This study aimed to assess COVID-19 related worries and resilience as potential moderators of the loneliness-sleep problems link. Method: In the midst of the lock-down period of COVID-19, we collected data using a web-based public platform from 243 Israeli older adults (mean age = 69.76, SD = 6.69, age range = 60-92). Participants completed measures of COVID-19 related loneliness, sleep problems, COVID-related worries, and resilience. Results: COVID-19 related loneliness was related to more sleep problems. The loneliness-sleep association was especially strong among those with more COVID-19 related worries or among those with lower resilience. Conclusion: The relationship between COVID-19 related loneliness and sleep problems is not uniform across older adults. The subjective sleep quality of those with more COVID-19 related worries or less resilience (i.e., feeling less being able to adapt to the challenging circumstances) is more susceptible to feeling lonely. Considering these variables may facilitate detection of and intervention for older adults vulnerable to aversive results in the context of COVID-19.",covid
"South Korea has experienced difficulty in controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early stages of the outbreak. South Korea remains passionately determined to protect Koreans against COVID-19 and through trial and error hopes to improve the strategies used to limit the outbreak. Here, we review how COVID-19 spread and what prevention strategies were implemented during the early stages of the outbreak in South Korea. We investigated online newspapers published in South Korea from 21 January 2020 to 20 March 2020, and reviewed academic medical articles related to COVID-19. Additionally, we acquired data on COVID-19 cases through the official website for COVID-19 in South Korea. To date, numerous measures have been applied by the government and the medical community during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak including the reporting of methods for diagnostic testing, patient classification, the introduction of drive-through screening centers, COVID-19 preventive measures, implementation of government policies for the shortage of face masks, and entry restrictions. Here, we present data from the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak and measures to prevent its spread in South Korea. We believe that sharing the experience of South Korea during the COVID-19 outbreak can help other countries to implement strategies to prevent its rapid transmission.",covid
"COVID-19 caused many countries to stop their elective procedures to allow preservation of resources for COVID-19 care. With restriction being gradually lifted, the surgical services have to face the pending burden of elective cases alongside the pandemic. The true impact of the pandemic and the COVID-19 on perioperative outcomes is still being discovered. This demands a COVID-specific consenting process in addition to the routine surgical consent, to ensure that the patients are able to make informed decisions. The first ever COVID-specific checklist for surgical consent 'COVID times-surgical consent checklist' is introduced. This checklist enables the surgeon to ensure that a discussion detailing the impact of COVID-19 on surgical services is made. It also acts as a documentation of the discussions carried out during the consenting process.",covid
"While the definitive diagnosis of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is mainly made by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), some PCR-negative cases are diagnosed typically by a computed tomography (CT) scan's radiology. However, there are many different infectious and non-infectious diseases that have radiology like COVID-19. We are presenting a case of a patient having symptoms and a CT scan radiology comparable to that of COVID-19 and also having eosinophilia. The patient was initially diagnosed and treated as a COVID-19 patient. The patient stated that she had always complained of having dyspnea and cough, but it had increased even more in the past few days. Her thorax CT revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities with upper lobe predominance, which was reported as highly compatible with COVID-19 by radiologists. COVID-19 PCR result was negative twice. In laboratory results, eosinophil count was 2,850/mm3 and total Ig was 768 IU/mL. However, when the laboratory values and the radiological findings were combined with the patient's history, COVID-19 was excluded and the chronic eosinophilic pneumonia was accepted as a diagnosis. Clinicians more focused on COVID-19 while questioning the patients and while evaluating the laboratory and the radiological findings make it easier to miss other infectious and non-infectious diseases. Assessing the complete blood count result, focusing on the lymphocyte value, also makes it easy to skip eosinophilia.",covid
"Introduction: The outbreak of COVID-19 is a serious health threat worldwide. Different degrees of liver injury or liver dysfunctions have been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection. However, currently, it remains unclear to what extent liver diseases should be considered as significant risk factors for the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Moreover, the mechanisms involved in liver injury in severe COVID-19 infection are not yet well understood. Area covered: This review summarizes the current evidence on liver function abnormalities in COVID-19 patients and the effects of preexisting liver disease on the disease severity. This review also illustrates the possible underlying mechanisms linking COVID-19 to liver injury, as well as provides recommendations to prevent liver damage in COVID-19 infection. Expert opinion: The elevated levels of ALT, AST, GGT and bilirubin are common in more severe patients than non-severe or mild COVID-19 patients. Patients with preexisting medical conditions including chronic hepatic diseases are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 infection. The drug's effects, possible viral inclusion in liver cells, systemic inflammation and hypoxia are potential causes of liver injury in severe COVID-19. Nevertheless, further studies are needed focusing on the preexisting hepatic diseases on prevention, treatment and outcome of COVID-19.",covid
"Background: Ayurvedic clinical profiling of COVID-19 is a pre-requisite to develop standalone and integrative treatment approaches. At present, Ayurvedic clinicians do not have access to COVID-19 patients in clinical settings. In these circumstances, a preliminary clinical profiling of COVID-19 based on review of modern medical and classical Ayurvedic literature with inputs from Allopathic clinicians treating COVID-19 patients assumes significance. Objectives: This paper aims to develop an Ayurvedic clinical profile of COVID-19 by literature review supported by analysis of clinical data of a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: The typical clinical presentation of COVID-19 was categorized based on a cluster of symptoms with reference to ""Interim Clinical Guidance for Management of Patients with confirmed corona virus disease (COVID-19)"" released by the US CDC. As the clinical presentation is found to vary widely, research papers reporting clinical symptoms of patient samples from different parts of the world were also reviewed to identify outliers and atypical presentations. Case records of fourteen COVID-19 patients treated at Medanta Hospital, Gurgaon were analyzed to compare symptomatology with data obtained from published literature. Further, a careful correlation was done with the data collected from selected Ayurvedic classical texts and expert views of clinical practitioners to arrive at a preliminary Ayurvedic clinical profile of COVID-19. Results: COVID-19 can be understood from the Ayurvedic perspective as vātakapha dominant sannipātajvara of āgantu origin with pittānubandha. The asymptomatic, presymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe and critical stages of COVID-19 with varying clinical presentations have been analysed on the basis of nidāna, doṣa, dūṣya, nidānapañcaka and ṣaṭkriyākāla to present a preliminary clinical profile of the disease. Conclusion: In this paper, we have demonstrated that a preliminary clinical profiling of COVID-19 from the Ayurvedic perspective is possible through literature review supported by discussions with Allopathic clinicians as well as examination of patient case records. The provisional diagnosis proposed can be further developed with continued review of literature, wider cooperation and teamwork with Allopathic physicians and access to clinical data as well as direct clinical assessment of COVID-19 patients.",covid
"This is a brief report of a patient who has refractory Myasthenia Gravis, on multiple long-term immunosuppressive therapies and contracted COVID-19 during this 2020 pandemic.

"In this paper, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and COVID-19 were compared. Compared with the other two diseases, COVID-19 is more contagious, more concealed in transmission, greater infectious intensity and more severe in clinical manifestations. If the COVID-19 epidemic was not effectively controlled, it would have a serious impact on human health and even social development. Understanding the characteristics of three diseases, especially COVID-19, and improving the awareness of the harmfulness of COVID-19 are of certain significance to the implementation of the guiding principle of ""scientific prevention and treatment, precise implementation of strategies"" and the prevention and control of COVID-19.",covid
"The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has led to immense strain on healthcare systems and workers. Patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 may also present with acute neurological emergencies such as ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke in these patients may result from COVID-19 related complications or decompensation of previously asymptomatic cerebrovascular disorders, or concurrent ischemic stroke from common stroke risk factors in a patient with COVID-19. Acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusions require emergent triage, intensive care, and mechanical thrombectomy. Management of patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO) requires special considerations in the current pandemic. Physicians must now account for prognosis of severe COVID-19, resource utilization, and risk of infection to healthcare workers when determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Here, we describe important prognostic factors including age, laboratory, and imaging findings to consider for MT selection and provide suggestions for taking care of patients with LVO and possible or confirmed COVID-19. It is recommended to perform MT in patients within the established guidelines, and consider a conservative approach in cases where there is clinical equipoise to minimize futile reperfusion. Lastly, we describe an illustrative case of a patient with ischemic stroke and COVID-19.",covid
"The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a newly emerged strain that has never been found in humans before. At present, the laboratory-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the main method to confirm COVID-19 infection. The intensification of the COVID-19 epidemic overwhelms limited clinical resources in particular, but not only, in developing countries, resulting in many patients not being tested for the infection and in large queues of potentially infected individuals waiting to be tested while providing a breeding ground for the disease. We describe here a rapid, highly sensitive, point-of-care, molecular test amenable for use at home, in the clinic, and at points of entry by minimally trained individuals and with minimal instrumentation. Our test is based on loop mediated isothermal amplification (COVID-19 LAMP) and for higher sensitivity on nested nucleic acid, two stage isothermal amplification (COVID-19 Penn-RAMP). Both tests can be carried out in closed tubes with either fluorescence or colorimetric (e.g., leuco crystal violet LCV) detection. COVID-19 LAMP performs on par with COVID-19 RT-PCR. COVID-19 RAMP has 10 fold better sensitivity than COVID-19 LAMP and COVID-19 RT-PCR when testing purified targets and 100 times better sensitivity than COVID-19 LAMP and COVID-19 RT-PCR when testing rapidly prepared sample mimics. Due to fortunate scarcity of COVID-19 infections in the USA, we were not able to test our assays and methods with patient samples. We hope that such tests will be carried out by colleagues in impacted countries. Our Closed-Tube Penn-RAMP has the potential to significantly reduce false negatives while being amenable to use with minimal instrumentation and training.",covid
"Background: Blood coagulation disorders commonly occur with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, there is only limited evidence on differentiating the pattern of the hemostatic parameters from those of typical sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). Methods: To elucidate the specific pattern of coagulopathy induced by COVID-19 pneumonia, this retrospective, observational study targeted consecutive adult patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and compared hemostatic biomarkers with non-COVID-19-induced septic ARDS. Multilevel mixed-effects regression analysis was performed and Kaplan-Meier failure curves were constructed. Results: We enrolled 24 patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS and 200 patients with non-COVID-19-induced ARDS. Platelet count, antithrombin activity, and prothrombin time in the COVID-19 group were almost within normal range and time series alterations of these markers were significantly milder than the non-COVID-19 group (p = 0.052, 0.037, and 0.005, respectively). However, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product and D-dimer were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (p = 0.001, 0.002, respectively). COVID-19 patients had moderately high levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex and plasmin-alpha2-plasmin inhibitor complex but normal plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level. Conclusions: The hematological phenotype of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy is quite different from that in typical SIC characterized by systemic hypercoagulation and suppressed fibrinolysis. Instead, local thrombus formation might be promoted in severe COVID-19.",covid

"Background: Although ""infodemiological"" methods have been used in research on coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an examination of the extent of infodemic moniker (misinformation) use on the internet remains limited. Objective: The aim of this paper is to investigate internet search behaviors related to COVID-19 and examine the circulation of infodemic monikers through two platforms-Google and Instagram-during the current global pandemic. Methods: We have defined infodemic moniker as a term, query, hashtag, or phrase that generates or feeds fake news, misinterpretations, or discriminatory phenomena. Using Google Trends and Instagram hashtags, we explored internet search activities and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic from February 20, 2020, to May 6, 2020. We investigated the names used to identify the virus, health and risk perception, life during the lockdown, and information related to the adoption of COVID-19 infodemic monikers. We computed the average peak volume with a 95% CI for the monikers. Results: The top six COVID-19-related terms searched in Google were ""coronavirus,"" ""corona,"" ""COVID,"" ""virus,"" ""corona virus,"" and ""COVID-19."" Countries with a higher number of COVID-19 cases had a higher number of COVID-19 queries on Google. The monikers ""coronavirus ozone,"" ""coronavirus laboratory,"" ""coronavirus 5G,"" ""coronavirus conspiracy,"" and ""coronavirus bill gates"" were widely circulated on the internet. Searches on ""tips and cures"" for COVID-19 spiked in relation to the US president speculating about a ""miracle cure"" and suggesting an injection of disinfectant to treat the virus. Around two thirds (n=48,700,000, 66.1%) of Instagram users used the hashtags ""COVID-19"" and ""coronavirus"" to disperse virus-related information. Conclusions: Globally, there is a growing interest in COVID-19, and numerous infodemic monikers continue to circulate on the internet. Based on our findings, we hope to encourage mass media regulators and health organizers to be vigilant and diminish the use and circulation of these infodemic monikers to decrease the spread of misinformation.",covid
"Covid-19 excess deaths refer to increases in mortality over what would normally have been expected in the absence of the Covid-19 pandemic. In this study, we take advantage of spatial variation in Covid-19 mortality across US counties to construct an Ordinary Least Squares regression model estimating its relationship with all-cause mortality. We then examine how the extent of excess mortality not assigned to Covid-19 varies across subsets of counties defined by demographic, structural, and policy characteristics. We estimate that 20.4% [95% CI (13.7%, 27.2%)] of excess deaths between February 1 and August 26, 2020 were ascribed to causes of death other than Covid-19 itself. Excess deaths not assigned to Covid-19 were even higher than predicted by our model in counties with high income inequality, low median income, low homeownership, and high percentages of Black residents, showing a pattern related to socioeconomic disadvantage and structural racism. Our work suggests that inequities in excess deaths attributable to Covid-19 may be even greater than revealed by data reporting deaths assigned to Covid-19 alone.",covid
"The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on the positive of etiological test.

"Background and aims: COVID-19 disease has been associated with disproportionate mortality amongst world population. We try to elucidate various reasons for lower mortality rate in the Indian subcontinent due to COVID-19 pandemic. Method: We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords such as 'COVID-19', 'Pandemics', 'disease outbreaks' and 'India' on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate in the month of May 2020 during the current COVID-19 pandemic and assessed mortality data. Results: The mortality observed in Indian and south Asian subcontinent is lower than in the west. Multifactorial reasons indicated for this differential mortality due to COVID-19 have been described in the current literature. Conclusions: The effects of COVID-19 on the health of racial and ethnic minority groups are still emerging with disproportionate burden of illness and death amongst some black and ethnic minority groups. Overall the current COVID-19 related mortality appears to be lower in the health and resource challenged populous Indian subcontinent. Further scientific studies would be helpful to understand this disparity in mortality due to COVID-19 in the world population.",covid
"Background and aims: Presence of comorbidities in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have often been associated with increased in-hospital complications and mortality. Intriguingly, several developed countries with a higher quality of life have relatively higher mortality with COVID-19, compared to the middle- or low-income countries. Moreover, certain ethnic groups have shown a higher predilection to contract COVID-19, with heightened mortality. We sought to review the available literature with regards to impact of COVID-19 and comorbidities on the health and economics, especially in context to the developing countries including India. Methods: A Boolean search was carried out in PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar databases up till August 23, 2020 using the specific keywords, to find the prevalence of comorbidities and its outcome in patients with COVID-19. Results: All available evidence consistently suggests that presence of comorbidities is associated with a poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. Diabetes prevalence is highest in Indian COVID-19 patients, compared to other countries. Majority of the patients with COVID-19 are asymptomatic ranging from 26 to 76%. Conclusions: Universal masking is the need of hour during unlock period. Low-income countries such as India, Brazil and Africa with less resources and an average socio-economic background, must adopt a strict policy for an affordable testing programs to trace, test, identify and home quarantine of asymptomatic cases. Despite the huge number of COVID-19 patients, India still has low volume research at the moment.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has resulted in tremendous morbidity and mortality worldwide. A major underlying cause of COVID-19 mortality is a hyperinflammatory cytokine storm in severe/critically ill patients. Although many clinical trials are testing the efficacy of targeting inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in COVID-19 patients, the critical inflammatory mediator initiating COVID-19 patient death is undefined. Here we suggest that the immunopathological pathway leading to COVID-19 mortality can be divided into three stages with distinct clinical features that can be used to guide therapeutic strategies. Our interpretation of the recently published clinical trials from COVID-19 patients suggests that the clinical efficacy in preventing COVID-19 mortality using IL-1 blockade is subjected to notable caveats, while that for IL-6 blockade is suboptimal. We discuss critical factors in determining appropriate inflammatory cytokine/chemokine targets, timing, and combination of treatments to prevent COVID-19 mortality.",covid

"On December 31, 2019, novel SARS-CoV2 spread from Wuhan China to more than 200 territories around world and the World Health Organization declared a COVID-19 pandemic on January 30, 2020. At this time there is no particular therapy, drug or vaccine available to deal with COVID-19. Today actual data indicates that about 17% of closed COVID-19 cases died. Health care professionals, ministry of health in countries and the public are trying to read the runes to see when the COVID-19 pandemic will be over. Although mild cases of COVID-19 can be controlled with antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory treatment, severe cases may need intensive care unit support and ventilation. Cytokine storms cause high inflammatory responses and pneumonia in severe cases. Mesenchymal stem cells are immunomodulatory and they have regenerative capacity. In this sense, mesenchymal stem cells may improve the patient's clinical and immunological response to COVID-19.",covid
"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak generated an unprecedented set of emotional challenges for women diagnosed with breast cancer. In the United Kingdom (UK), the pandemic significantly disrupted oncology services as resources were reassigned to care for COVID-19 patients. In addition to service disruptions, many women received a UK Government letter advising them to shield for 12-weeks. We aimed to explore the effect of disruption to scheduled oncology services and the UK Government shielding letter on emotional and cognitive vulnerability. A further aim was to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 related emotional vulnerability (COVID-EMV) and anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function. Women diagnosed with primary breast cancer (N = 234) completed a series of online questionnaires to assess their cognitive and emotional wellbeing as well as their COVID-EMV. Results indicated that disrupted oncology services had a significant impact on COVID-EMV, anxiety and depression, with those experiencing disruptions expressing higher general emotional vulnerability as well as COVID-EMV. Further, the UK Government letter had a significant effect on perceived cognitive function; those who received the letter reported poorer cognitive function. Regression analyses revealed that after allowing for the effects of sociodemographic and clinical variables, women's COVID-EMV significantly predicted worse outcomes of anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function. Our findings indicate that concerns about COVID-19 amongst women affected by breast cancer leads to increased risk of developing affective disorder, such as anxiety and depression symptomatology, among this sample. We advocate the rapid implementation of accessible interventions designed to promote emotional resilience in the breast cancer population.",covid
"Background and aims: Covid-19 is a global pandemic that requires a global and integrated response of all national medical and healthcare systems. Covid-19 exposed the need for timely response and data sharing on fast spreading global pandemics. In this study, we investigate the scientific research response from the early stages of the pandemic, and we review key findings on how the early warning systems developed in previous epidemics responded to contain the virus. Methods: We conducted data mining of scientific literature records from the Web of Science Core Collection, using the topics Covid-19, mortality, immunity, and vaccine. The individual records are analysed in isolation, and the analysis is compared with records on all Covid-19 research topics combined. The data records are analysed with commutable statistical methods, including R Studio's Bibliometrix package, and the Web of Science data mining tool. Results: From historical analysis of scientific data records on viruses, pandemics and mortality, we identified that Chinese universities have not been leading on these topics historically. However, during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese universities are strongly dominating the research on these topics. Despite the current political and trade disputes, we found strong collaboration in Covid-19 research between the US and China. From the analysis on Covid-19 and immunity, we wanted to identify the relationship between different risk factors discussed in the news media. We identified a few clusters, containing references to exercise, inflammation, smoking, obesity and many additional factors. From the analysis on Covid-19 and vaccine, we discovered that although the USA is leading in volume of scientific research on Covid-19 vaccine, the leading 3 research institutions (Fudan, Melbourne, Oxford) are not based in the USA. Hence, it is difficult to predict which country would be first to produce a Covid-19 vaccine. Conclusions: We analysed the conceptual structure maps with factorial analysis and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and identified multiple relationships between keywords, synonyms and concepts, related to Covid-19 mortality, immunity, and vaccine development. We present integrated and corelated knowledge from 276 records on Covid-19 and mortality, 71 records on Covid-19 and immunity, and 189 records on Covid-19 vaccine.",covid
"A new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is rapidly spreading worldwide and causes pneumonia, respiratory distress, thromboembolic events, and death. Chest computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the diagnosis of viral pneumonia, monitoring disease progression, determination of disease severity, and evaluating therapeutic efficacy. Chest CT can show important clues of 2019-nCoV disease (also known as COVID-19) in patients with an appropriate clinic. Prompt diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to prevent disease transmission and provide close clinical observation of patients with clinically severe disease. Therefore, radiologists and clinicians should be familiar with the CT imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. Herein we aimed to review the imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and to examine the critical points to be considered for imaging in cases with COVID-19 suspicion.",covid
"COVID-19 outbreak is major pandemic affecting lakhs of people all across the globe. Along with other nonspecific clinical features, reports mention anosmia to be an important symptom in COVID-19 positive patients. To study the prevalence of anosmia in confirmed COVID-19 patients, in Indian population and to ascertain its significance as a symptom of COVID 19. Study was done at a tertiary care COVID treating hospital. While eliciting detailed history from Covid-19 positive patients, all patients were asked about symptom of anosmia. Same was asked from control group of subjects who were COVID-19 negative. The history of anosmia was also elicited on discharge after the patients tested negative for COVID-19. 74 patients formed part of the study. 11 of 74 (14.8%) patients had anosmia. On using the chi square test for significance the difference was significant (p < .01), suggesting anosmia to be a significant clinical feature in COVID-19 patients. On comparing with world literature it was observed that the prevalence of anosmia is higher in European population as compared to Indian Also the symptom of anosmia improved when the patient recovered from the disease. Prevalence of new onset anosmia in Indian population with COVID-19 is 14.8%. Symptom of anosmia in present times should be considered as a important clinical feature and should raise a suspicion of COVID-19. The prevalence of anosmia in Indian population is much lesser than that reported in European population.",covid
"Today clinicians may diagnose hundreds of people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report the case of a child with asthma who sought care for COVID-19 symptoms whose condition did not improve despite appropriate treatment for asthma, pneumonia and COVID-19.

It is important to consider that in pandemics such as COVID-19, because all attention is paid to the disease, underlying hidden causes may be neglected.",covid
"The need to know more about COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) has led to a rapid increase in scientific publications on this virus in a short period of time. Rapidity in publishing can accelerate the achievement of the ultimate goal of answering our questions about COVID-19 but there may be concerns. One of our concerns is the carelessness to research ethics in COVID-19 studies, which may sacrifice research ethics for high-speed publishing. In this article, we address some of the concerns about research ethics in the study of COVID-19.",covid
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic exposes individuals not only to health-related risks, but also to psychosocial fear and acute stress. Previous studies reveal that individuals who experienced child abuse (CA), especially those who suffer from complex posttraumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), are at a higher risk of reacting with fear and stress when faced with stressful life-events. Objective: To test whether exposure to CA is implicated in a higher risk of COVID-19-related fear and acute stress, and whether CPTSD intervenes in such processes. Participants and settings: A convenience sample of 837 adults participated in the study during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel. Methods: Participants completed self-report questionnaires, assessing child physical, sexual and emotional abuse, CPTSD (ITQ), COVID-19-related acute stress disorder (COVID-19 ASD; ASDS) and fear of COVID-19. Results: Bivariate analyses showed that participants who experienced CA were higher than participants who did not experience CA in COVID-19 ASD (p = .032), but not in fear of COVID-19 (p = .65). Mediation analyses demonstrated two significant paths: in the first, CA was associated with elevated fear of COVID-19 (effect = .061, .059; p < 0.05) and COVID-19 ASD (effect = .14, .084; p < 0.05) through the mediation of CPTSD; in the second path, when controlling for the mediation of CPTSD, CA was associated with reduced fear of COVID-19 (effect = -.15; p = 0.001), and COVID-19 ASD (effect = -.12; p = 0.024). Conclusions: The findings reveal a complex pattern, indicating that CPTSD may be a risk factor for elevated levels of COVID-19 distress among individuals who experienced CA. However, some CA survivors may express reduced COVID-19 distress.",covid
"This article summarizes the benefits of Oxytocin (OT) in the attenuation of coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) pathogenesis. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has become pandemic with 7,323,761 of infected patients and has created health emergency throughout the world. On the basis of clinical study, COVID-19 shows homology with other coronavirus pathogenesis i.e. inflammation, oxidative stress, and hyper-activation of immune system, results cytokine storm and causes acute lung infection (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and kidney dysfunction. OT is a peptide of nine amino acid, well known anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and immune-modulator molecule protective against ALI/ARDS, nephrotoxicity, sepsis, and ischemia-reperfusion medical condition. OT is a neuromodulatory, effective for stress, anxiety, social behaviour, and depression, which might be helpful for better output of COVID-19 patients. There is significant data showing OT would be useful for treatment of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Direct application of OT in COVID19 is unclear, but its use in experimental model as well as human has continuously documented its safety, and its use by COVID-19 patients predictably would be highly beneficial.",covid
"Background and objective: The novel Coronavirus also called COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has now spread across the world. It has so far infected around 1.8 million people and claimed approximately 114,698 lives overall. As the number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing shortage of testing kits and resources. The limited quantity of testing kits and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting COVID-19 cases using chest X-rays. Methods: In this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to automatically detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The proposed model is based on Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset and trained end-to-end on a dataset prepared by collecting COVID-19 and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available databases. Results: CoroNet has been trained and tested on the prepared dataset and the experimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 89.6%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for COVID-19 cases are 93% and 98.2% for 4-class cases (COVID vs Pneumonia bacterial vs pneumonia viral vs normal). For 3-class classification (COVID vs Pneumonia vs normal), the proposed model produced a classification accuracy of 95%. The preliminary results of this study look promising which can be further improved as more training data becomes available. Conclusion: CoroNet achieved promising results on a small prepared dataset which indicates that given more data, the proposed model can achieve better results with minimum pre-processing of data. Overall, the proposed model substantially advances the current radiology based methodology and during COVID-19 pandemic, it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid them in diagnosis, quantification and follow-up of COVID-19 cases.",covid

"Objectives: To compare the chest computed tomography (CT) findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to other non-COVID viral pneumonia. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched through April 04, 2020, for published English language studies. Studies were eligible if they included immunocompetent patients with up to 14 days of viral pneumonia. Subjects had a respiratory tract sample test positive for COVID-19, adenovirus, influenza A, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, or respiratory syncytial virus. We only included observational studies and case series with more than ten patients. The pooled prevalence of each chest CT pattern or finding was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: From 2263 studies identified, 33 were eligible for inclusion, with a total of 1911 patients (COVID-19, n = 934; non-COVID, n = 977). Frequent CT features for both COVID-19 and non-COVID viral pneumonia were a mixed pattern of ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation (COVID-19, 0.37; 0.17-0.56; non-COVID, 0.46; 0.35-0.58) or predominantly GGO pattern (COVID-19, 0.42; 0.28-0.55; non-COVID 0.25; 0.17-0.32), bilateral distribution (COVID-19, 0.81; 0.77-0.85; non-COVID, 0.69; 0.54-0.84), and involvement of lower lobes (COVID-19, 0.88; 0.80-0.95; non-COVID, 0.61; 0.50-0.82). COVID-19 pneumonia presented a higher prevalence of peripheral distribution (COVID-19 0.77; 0.67-0.87; non-COVID 0.34; 0.18-0.49), and involvement of upper (COVID-19, 0.77; 0.65-0.88; non-COVID 0.18; 0.10-0.27) and middle lobes (COVID-19, 0.61; 0.47-0.76; non-COVID 0.24; 0.11-0.38). Conclusion: Except for a higher prevalence of peripheral distribution, involvement of upper and middle lobes, COVID-19, and non-COVID viral pneumonia had overlapping chest CT findings. Key points: • Most common CT findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were a predominant pattern of ground-glass opacity (GGO), followed by a mixed pattern of GGO and consolidation, bilateral disease, peripheral distribution, and lower lobe involvement. • Most frequent CT findings of non-COVID viral pneumonia were a predominantly mixed pattern of GGO and consolidation, followed by a predominant pattern of GGO, bilateral disease, random or diffuse distribution, and lower lobe involvement. • COVID-19 pneumonia presented a higher prevalence of peripheral distribution, and involvement of upper and middle lobes compared with non-COVID viral pneumonia.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has recently emerged as a global health threat. To address this health emergency, various therapeutic approaches are currently under investigation. There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) as COVID-19 therapies, and thus World Health Organization (WHO) mentioned that ""Current data shows that this drug does not reduce deaths among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, nor help people with mild or moderate disease."" CQ and HCQ are typically used for the treatment of malaria but have been recognized for certain beneficial effects in COVID-19 patients based on some clinical outcomes from the clinical treatment of COVID-19. A standard dose of HCQ has been proven effective and less toxic than CQ in COVID-19 patients; however, a comprehensive understanding of a patient's clinical condition is necessary. Based on several hospital findings, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has officially cancelled the emergency use authorization for HCQ and CQ for treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients on June 15, 2020. In this review, we highlight both pros and cons of the clinical use of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 patients.",covid
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel illness, which is not fully understood. Whether an individual has traveled outside their respective country or never left their community, COVID-19 is a highly contagious illness, which can result in high death rates. Biobanks will play a role in providing tools to examine data from those receiving treatment along with reviewing the current and long treatment outcomes associated with this novel coronavirus disease. A diverse, global network made up of laboratory scientists, clinical researchers, epidemiologists, data science teams, physicians, and so on must have a standardized, collaborative, virtual biobanking solution to share clinical expertise and evidence-based solutions. This virtual biobank must be centrally managed to ensure standardized quality assurance and quality control efforts. Virtual biobanks will eliminate the need to transport samples between two locations for a specific study, minimizing the risk of contamination. It is necessary for virtual biobanks to upload imaging data from those patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Standardized, collected information will be essential in the area of discovery and validation of disease markers as well as novel therapeutic strategies. It is essential for biobanks to collect COVID-19 specimens along with corresponding clinical and demographic data from COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Because COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness, proper collection procedures must be in place to collect respiratory samples for biobanking purposes. A preconfigured purpose-built COVID-19 Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is an efficient tool to seamlessly manage a data sharing network. Data entered into LIMS will be beneficial in designing much needed clinical trials to address any unmet needs to better address clinical treatment and outcomes. The partners or entities associated with the COVID-19 data sharing network will be able to effectively communicate, view data, and images associated with their respective research interest to advance COVID-19 research and data driven, clinical care.",covid
"Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of oral l-Glutamine supplementation on hospitalization time, need for intensive care unit and Coronavirus Disease-19 (Covid-19) mortality. Methods: The study included 30 Covid-19 patients using l-Glutamine and 30 Covid-19 patients who did not use l-Glutamine with similar age, gender and clinical status. Diagnostic tests, laboratory examinations, clinical findings and computed thorax tomography imaging of the patients were evaluated. Results: Hospitalization time was 10.4 ± 1.9 days in Covid-19 without L-Glutamine group and 8.9 ± 1.8 days in Covid-19 with L-Glutamine group (p = 0.005). In Covid-19 without the L-Glutamine group, four patients require the ICU though no one in the other group required that (p = 0.038). Only one mortality was observed in Covid-19 without the L-Glutamine group (p = 0.999). Conclusions: Nutritional supplements such as L-Glutamine boost immune system especially by inhibition of inflammatory responses. Our results suggest adding enteral L-glutamine to the normal nutrition in the early period of Covid-19 infection may lead to a shortened hospital stay and lead to less need for ICU. Larger-scale studies are needed to evaluate the effect of adding enteral L-Glutamine to the currently used treatments in the infectious diseases especially like Covid-19.",covid
"Background: The reasons why some patients with COVID-19 develop pneumonia and others do not are unclear. To better understand this, we used multiparameter flow cytometry to profile circulating leukocytes from non-immunocompromised adult patients with PCR-proven COVID-19 and specifically compared those with mild symptoms with those who had developed pneumonia. Methods: Using clinically validated antibody panels we studied leukocytes from 29 patients with PCR-proven COVID-19. Ten were hypoxic requiring ventilatory support, eleven were febrile but otherwise well, and eight were convalescing having previously required ventilatory support. Additionally, we analysed patients who did not have COVID-19 but received ventilatory support for other reasons. We examined routine Full Blood Count (FBC) specimens that were surplus to routine diagnostic requirements; normal ranges were established in a historic group of healthy volunteers. Findings: We observed striking and unexpected differences in cells of the innate immune system. Levels of CD11b and CD18, which together comprise Complement Receptor 3 (CR3), were increased in granulocytes and monocytes from hypoxic COVID-19 patients, but not in those with COVID-19 who remained well, or in those without COVID-19 but ventilated for other reasons. Granulocyte and monocyte numbers were unchanged, however Natural Killer (NK) cell numbers were two-fold higher than normal in COVID-19 patients who remained well. Interpretation: CR3 is central to leukocyte activation and subsequent cytokine release in response to infection. It is also a fibrinogen receptor, and its over-expression in granulocytes and monocytes of patients with respiratory failure tables it as a candidate effector of both the thrombotic and inflammatory features of COVID-19 pneumonia, and both a biomarker of impending respiratory failure and potential therapeutic target. NK cells are innate immune cells that retain immunological memory. Rapid expansion of memory NK cells targeting common antigens shared with other Coronaviruses may explain why most patients with COVID-19 do not develop respiratory complications. Understanding the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-may uncover why most infected individuals experience mild symptoms, and inform a preventive approach to COVID-19 pneumonia in the future.",covid
"Nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 puts patients with other medical problems at risk of severe illness and death. Of 662 inpatients with COVID-19 at an NHS Trust in South London, 45 (6.8%) were likely to have acquired COVID-19 in hospital. These patients had no evidence of respiratory or influenza-like illness on admission and developed symptoms, with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results, more than 7 days after admission (>14 days for 38 [5.7%] patients). Forty (88.9%) of these patients had shared a ward with a confirmed COVID-19 case prior to testing positive. Implementation of a triage system combining clinical assessment with rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing facilitated cohorting so that fewer susceptible patients were exposed to COVID-19 on shared wards. With hospital service resumption alongside the possibility of future waves of COVID-19 related admissions, strategies to prevent nosocomial transmission are essential. Point-of-care diagnostics can complement clinical assessment to rapidly identify patients with COVID-19 and reduce risk of transmission within hospitals.",covid
"Purpose: War and natural disaster have been spurs to the creation of rehabilitation services. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a different question for existing rehabilitation services: how best to respond to a disaster that is anticipated from afar, but whose shape has yet to take full form? Methods: Applying the 5-phase crisis management model of Pearson and Mitroff, we report our experience at one of Scotland's largest centres for rehabilitation, in planning to cope with COVID-19. Results: Contingency rehabilitation planning can be framed in a 5-phase crisis management model that includes (i) signal detection; (ii) prevention/preparedness; (iii) damage limitation; (iv) recovery; and (v) learning. We have reported the impact of COVID-19 on rehabilitation services within a Scottish context and shared some of our learning. Conclusion: COVID-19 has challenged healthcare worldwide and has served as an amplifier for the recognised ill effects of poverty and inequality. As rehabilitation clinicians, we are in a position to continue advocating for people facing disability, and also seeking and responding to signals of COVID-19's late effects in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients alike.

"Background & aims: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads rapidly and within no time, it has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Evidence suggests diabetes to be a risk factor for the progression and poor prognosis of COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to understand the pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients infected with COVID-19. We also aimed to compute the risk of mortality and ICU admissions in COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed to identify the articles reporting the diabetes prevalence and risk of mortality or ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was to compute the pooled prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 patients. Secondary outcomes included risk of mortality and ICU admissions in COVID-19 patients with diabetes compared to patients without diabetes. Results: This meta-analysis was based on a total of 23007 patients from 43 studies. The pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients infected with COVID-19 was found to be 15% (95% CI: 12%-18%), p = <0.0001. Mortality risk was found to be significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with diabetes as compared to COVID-19 patients without diabetes with a pooled risk ratio of 1.61 (95% CI: 1.16-2.25%), p = 0.005. Likewise, risk of ICU admission rate was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with diabetes as compared to COVID-19 patients without diabetes with a pooled risk ratio of 1.88 (1.20%-2.93%), p = 0.006. Conclusion: This meta-analysis found a high prevalence of diabetes and higher mortality and ICU admission risk in COVID-19 patients with diabetes.",covid
"There is much discussion of adopting COVID-19 immunity certificates to allow those proven to have antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 to resume normal life and help restart the economy. This article points out issues that must be considered before adopting any such program. These issues fall into six categories: the uncertain science of COVID-19 immunity; the questionable quality of COVID-19 antibody tests; practical problems with issuing such certificates; deciding how the certificates might be used; ethical and social issues they would raise, especially fairness and self-infection; and potential legal barriers. It does not ultimately take a position on whether some narrow COVID-19 immunity plans should be adopted, concluding that the answer depends on too many currently unknown conditions. But its seventh part makes recommendations to decision-makers who might consider implementing such programs.",covid
"Objectives: Older adults are at higher risk for death and infirmity from COVID-19 than younger and middle-age adults. The current study examines COVID-19-specific anxiety and proactive coping as potential risk and resilience factors that may be differentially important for younger and older adults in understanding stress experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Five hundred and fifteen adults aged 20-79 in the U.S. reported on their anxiety about developing COVID-19, proactive coping, and stress related to COVID-19 in an online survey. Results: Although there were no age differences in stress levels, anxiety about developing COVID-19 was associated with more COVID-19 stress for older adults relative to younger adults, but proactive coping was associated with less COVID-19 stress for older adults relative to younger adults. Discussion: Our results suggest that anxiety might function as a risk factor whereas proactive coping may function as a resilience factor for older adults' COVID-19 stress. We encourage future context-dependent investigations into mental health among older adults during this pandemic and beyond.",covid
"Objective: The Western Center for Agricultural Health and Safety (WCAHS) at the University of California, Davis implemented a multifaceted rapid response to COVID-19 in the western United States. This paper describes the center's response from mid-March through June 30, 2020. Methods: A comprehensive needs assessment was conducted with agricultural stakeholders. Agriculture-specific COVID-19 resources were developed and disseminated, and a farmer/employer survey was launched. Results: The WCAHS COVID-19 resources web page, worksite checklist, and training guide were shared on over 50 web pages nationally. As of June 30, 2020, 282 online surveys have been received. Ongoing informal discussions with agricultural stakeholders indicate a disconnect between the experiences of farmers/employers and farmworkers in relation to COVID-19 prevention at the worksite. Initial survey responses indicate that implementing social distancing is one of the greatest challenges at the worksite. Confusion over local, state, and federal guidelines and which to follow is another concern. Conclusion: The WCAHS response to COVID-19, in close collaboration with agricultural stakeholders, represents a useful model for a rapid response to a public health crisis by regional centers. Key elements to its success include rapid personalized communication with a wide range of agricultural stakeholders, an actively engaged External Advisory Board, the development of industry-specific resources and information, recurring and iterative engagement with stakeholders as new COVID-19 information emerged and resources were developed, and the identification of the unique gap WCAHS was positioned to fill. The multipronged dissemination approach enhanced the reach of WCAHS COVID-19 resources.",covid
"Available data suggest that the issue of CoViD-19 is particularly critical in patients with diabetes. In Italy, Internal Medicine (IM) wards have played a pivotal role in contrasting the spread of SARS-Cov2. During this pandemic, FADOI submitted a brief questionnaire to a group of its members acting as Head of IM units. Considering 38 units, 58% of beds dedicated to CoViD patients in CoViD Hospitals were in charge of IM, and globally cared for 6650 patients during a six-week period. Of these patients, 1264 (19%) had diabetes. Mortality rate in CoViD patients with or without diabetes were 20.5% and 14%, respectively (p < 0.001). Our survey seems to confirm that diabetes is a major comorbidity of CoViD-19, but it does not support an increased incidence of CoViD-19 infection in people with diabetes, if compared with the figures of patients with diabetes and hospitalized before the outbreak. On the other side, patients with diabetes appeared at a significantly increased risk of worse outcome. This finding underlines the importance of paying special attention to this patient population and its management.",covid
"Background: Since its first appearance in December of 2019, regular updates around the world demonstrates that the number of new Corona Virus 2019 (COVID-19) cases are increasing rapidly, indicating that not only does COVID-19 exhibit a rapid spread pattern, but human intervention is necessary for its resolution. Up until today (27-5-2020) and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has surpassed 4.5 million with more than 307, 500 deaths. Almost all countries have been affected by COVID-19, and resultingly, various drug trials have been conducted, however, a targeted treatment remains to be made accessible to the public. Recently, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) has gained some attention for its discovery as a potential attachment target of COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed the most recent evidence regarding ACE2 distribution and action, the binding mechanism of COVID-19 and its correlation to cellular injury, ACE2 polymorphisms and its association to fatal COVID-19 and susceptibility and, finally, current ACE2-based pharmacotherapies against COVID-19. Results: Blocking the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) using a specific ligand can prevent COVID-19 from binding, and consequently cellular entry and injury. Comparatively, soluble ACE2, which has a higher affinity to COVID-19, can neutralize COVID-19 without affecting the homeostatic function of naturally occurring ACE2. Lastly, ACE2 mutations and their possible effect on the binding activity of COVID-19 may enable researchers to identify high-risk groups before they become exposed to COVID-19. Conclusion: ACE2 represents a promising target to attenuate or prevent COVID-19 associated cellular injury.",covid
"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a novel disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that rapidly spread around the globe. The dramatic increase in the number of cases and deaths have placed tremendous strain on health care systems worldwide. As health care workers and society adjust to focus treatment and prevention of COVID-19, other facets of the health care enterprise are affected, particularly surgical volume and revenue. The purpose of this study was to describe the financial impact of COVID-19 on an academic neurosurgery department. Methods: A retrospective review of weekly average daily work relative value units (wRVUs) were compared before and after COVID-19 in the fiscal year 2020. A comparative time period of the same months in the year prior was also included for review. We also review strategies for triaging neurosurgical disease as needing emergent, urgent, or routine operative treatment. Results: Daily average wRVU after COVID-19 dropped significantly with losses in all weeks examined. Of the 7 weeks in the current post-COVID period, the weekly daily average wRVU was 173 (range, 128-363). The mean decline was 51.4% compared with the pre-COVID era. Both inpatient and outpatient revenue was affected. Conclusions: COVID-19 had a profound detrimental effect on surgical productivity and revenue generation.",covid
"Background: While recent reports suggest that people with disabilities (PwDs) are likely to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and face multiple challenges, previous research has not examined if COVID-19 burdens are unequally distributed with respect to the disability characteristics of the U.S. Objective: This article presents the first national scale study of the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and disability characteristics in the U.S. The objective is to determine whether COVID-19 incidence is significantly greater in counties containing higher percentages of socio-demographically disadvantaged PwDs, based on race, ethnicity, poverty status, age, and biological sex. Methods: This study integrates county-level data on confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering database with multiple disability variables from the 2018 American Community Survey. Statistical analyses are based on bivariate correlations and multivariate generalized estimating equations that consider spatial clustering in the data. Results: Greater COVID-19 incidence rate is significantly associated with: (1) higher percentages of PwDs who are Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, below poverty, under 18 years of age, and female; and (2) lower percentages of PwDs who are non-Hispanic White, above poverty, aged 65 or more years, and male, after controlling for spatial clustering. Conclusions: Socio-demographically disadvantaged PwDs are significantly overrepresented in counties with higher COVID-19 incidence compared to other PwDs. These findings represent an important starting point for more detailed investigation of the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 on PwDs and highlight the urgent need for COVID-19 data collection systems to incorporate disability information.",covid
"Background: At the end of 2019, an innovative coronavirus caused an outbreak of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city Hubei Province of China. Despite the direct effect on the routine of all life aspects, there are no clinical guidelines regarding phototherapy treatment during COVID-19 pandemic and as a result, phototherapies units continued to deliver this therapy for patients worldwide.Objective: We wish to explore the phototherapy utilization among dermatologic patients.Methods: We marked all patients that continue to arrive and being treated during COVID-19 pandemic.Results: From March more than 50% of patients stopped arriving to treatments due to the fear of COVID-19 infection.Conclusions: COVID-19 has a major implication on chronic dermatology treatments such as phototherapy.",covid
"Background: Protecting first-line health care providers against work-related coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection at the onset of the pandemic has been a crucial challenge in the United States. Anesthesiologists in particular are considered at risk, since aerosol-generating procedures, such as intubation and extubation, have been shown to significantly increase the odds for respiratory infections during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks. This study assessed the incidence of COVID-19-like symptoms and the presence of COVID-19 antibodies after work-related COVID-19 exposures, among physicians working in a large academic hospital in New York City (NYC). Methods: An e-mail survey was addressed to anesthesiologists and affiliated intensive care providers at Columbia University Irving Medical Center on April 15, 2020. The survey assessed 4 domains: (1) demographics and medical history, (2) community exposure to COVID-19 (eg, use of NYC subway), (3) work-related exposure to COVID-19, and (4) development of COVID-19-like symptoms after work exposure. The first 100 survey responders were invited to undergo a blood test to assess antibody status (presence of immunoglobulin M [IgM]/immunoglobulin G [IgG] specific to COVID-19). Work-related exposure was defined as any episode where the provider was not wearing adequate personal protective equipment (airborne or droplet/contact protection depending on the exposure type). Based on the clinical scenario, work exposure was categorized as high risk (eg, exposure during intubation) or low risk (eg, exposure during doffing). Results: Two hundred and five health care providers were contacted and 105 completed the survey (51%); 91 completed the serological test. Sixty-one of the respondents (58%) reported at least 1 work-related exposure and 54% of the exposures were high risk. Among respondents reporting a work-related exposure, 16 (26.2%) reported postexposure COVID-19-like symptoms. The most frequent symptoms were myalgia (9 cases), diarrhea (8 cases), fever (7 cases), and sore throat (7 cases). COVID-19 antibodies were detected in 11 of the 91 tested respondents (12.1%), with no difference between respondents with (11.8%) or without (12.5%) a work-related exposure, including high-risk exposure. Compared with antibody-negative respondents, antibody-positive respondents were more likely to use NYC subway to commute to work and report COVID-19-like symptoms in the past 90 days. Conclusions: In the epicenter of the United States' pandemic and within 6-8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak, a small proportion of anesthesiologists and affiliated intensive care providers reported COVID-19-like symptoms after a work-related exposure and even fewer had detectable COVID-19 antibodies. The presence of COVID-19 antibodies appeared to be associated with community/environmental transmission rather than secondary to work-related exposures involving high-risk procedures.",covid
"COVID-19 has drastically changed hospital systems from a microcosmic to macrocosmic level, specifically for surgical practices worldwide. COVID-19 surgical guidelines are continuing to evolve as we deepen our understanding of the virus. A particular point of interest is the possibility of aerosolization of COVID-19 during laparoscopic procedures. There is much uncertainty of the pathogenicity of COVID-19 and insufficient data on the presence and extent of viral load in different body fluids, specifically in peritoneal fluid. We present a case of a 27-year-old male who was diagnosed with acute appendicitis and found to be COVID-19 positive postoperatively. Intraoperative peritoneal fluid sampling was obtained and tested for COVID-19 through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting N1 and N2 proteins. COVID-19 was not detected in RT-PCR test in the peritoneal fluid collected; however, it was detected in the nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. The patient had prolonged stay in the hospital secondary to COVID-19 symptoms. Currently, there is very limited and inconclusive evidence on the presence of COVID-19 in peritoneal fluid. We present the first paper discussing perforated bowel, in which COVID-19 is not detected in peritoneal fluid. This case report provides more insight regarding shaping guidelines for surgeries in patients with COVID-19.",covid
"Prolonged prone position ventilation reduces the 30-day mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and probably in COVID-19 infection, too. Although the respiratory illness is the most important clinical manifestation of COVID-19, a large number of patients with COVID-19 suffer from new onset cardiac dysfunction where ECG and ECG monitoring play a critical role. However, the effects of prone position on the ECG is unknown. A healthy, 30-year-old man is presented with the change of ECG mimicking old myocardial infarction in the V1-3 leads after prone position. This could help us to recognize the true pathologic ECG signs in this situation. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(26): 1103-1104.",covid
"To listen to the podcast associated with this article, please select one of the following: iTunes, Google Play, or direct download. BACKGROUND. An increase in frequency of acute ischemic strokes has been observed among patients presenting with acute neurologic symptoms during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 and stroke subtypes in patients presenting with acute neurologic symptoms. METHODS. This retrospective case-control study included patients for whom a code for stroke was activated from March 16 to April 30, 2020, at any of six New York City hospitals that are part of a single health system. Demographic data (age, sex, and race or ethnicity), COVID-19 status, stroke-related risk factors, and clinical and imaging findings pertaining to stroke were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between COVID-19 and stroke subtypes. RESULTS. The study sample consisted of 329 patients for whom a code for stroke was activated (175 [53.2%] men, 154 [46.8%] women; mean age, 66.9 ± 14.9 [SD] years). Among the 329 patients, 35.3% (116) had acute ischemic stroke confirmed with imaging; 21.6% (71) had large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke; and 14.6% (48) had small vessel occlusion (SVO) stroke. Among LVO strokes, the most common location was middle cerebral artery segments M1 and M2 (62.0% [44/71]). Multifocal LVOs were present in 9.9% (7/71) of LVO strokes. COVID-19 was present in 38.3% (126/329) of the patients. The 61.7% (203/329) of patients without COVID-19 formed the negative control group. Among individual stroke-related risk factors, only Hispanic ethnicity was significantly associated with COVID-19 (38.1% of patients with COVID-19 vs 20.7% of patients without COVID-19; p = 0.001). LVO was present in 31.7% of patients with COVID-19 compared with 15.3% of patients without COVID-19 (p = 0.001). SVO was present in 15.9% of patients with COVID-19 and 13.8% of patients without COVID-19 (p = 0.632). In multivariate analysis controlled for race and ethnicity, presence of COVID-19 had a significant independent association with LVO stroke (odds ratio, 2.4) compared with absence of COVID-19 (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION. COVID-19 is associated with LVO strokes but not with SVO strokes. CLINICAL IMPACT. Patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute neurologic symptoms warrant a lower threshold for suspicion of large vessel stroke, and prompt workup for large vessel stroke is recommended.",covid
"The containment of the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and limitations on commercial activities, mobility and manufacturing sector have significantly affected waste management. Waste management is critical to human development and health outcomes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The invaluable service provided by the waste management sector ensures that the unusual heaps of waste that poses health risks and escalate the spread of COVID-19 is avoided. In this study, we assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on waste management by observing lockdown and social distancing measures. We found that the quantity of waste increased across countries observing the social distancing measure of staying at home. The intensification of single-use products and panic buying have increased production and consumption, hence thwarting efforts towards reducing plastic pollution. However, several countries have thus far instituted policies to ensure sustainable management of waste while protecting the safety of waste handlers.",covid
"We present a case of a 39-year-old male who presented with chest pain without fever or respiratory symptoms. Troponins were elevated and electrocardiogram (ECG) was inconclusive for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Angiography revealed normal coronaries and the patient was found to be coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive; he was diagnosed with COVID-19 myocarditis. With the global pandemic, more cases are emerging regarding myocardial injury induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Although COVID-19 manifests primarily as respiratory disease, few cases of cardiac injury without respiratory involvement or febrile illness have been reported. This case illustrates that COVID-19 can present atypically and affect an isolated non-respiratory organ system.",covid
"This article contains data on country-specific variability in Covid-19 prevalence, incidence, and case fatality rate among the 238 countries globally. We used the World Health Organization worldwide Covid-19 tracking site to determine the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, the number of fatalities attributed to Covid-19, and the case fatality rate for each of 238 countries. Using data from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, we extracted key country-specific metrics with potential associations with Covid-19 including total population, land area, population density, percentage of residents living in urban areas, and median age. We extracted country-specific economic indicators from The World Bank Group Open Data database. All data were extracted on August 15, 2020. We developed consolidated data sets and calculated the country-specific point prevalence and incidence of Covid-19 and associated deaths. These data are associated with the article ""Spatial Analysis of Global Variability in Covid-19 Burden"".

"Purpose: To assess Turkish oncology nurses' knowledge regarding novel coronavirus (COVID-19) during the current outbreak in Turkey. Methods: This descriptive study was carried out with the 185 oncology nurses between April and May 2020 in Turkey. Research data were collected through online survey using ""Nurse Information Form"" and ""Nurse Information Scale for COVID-19."" Multilinear regression analysis was used in determining the factors affecting oncology nurses' information regarding COVID-19. Results: According to the data delivered from 185 oncology nurses, 57.7% of the participants had an undergraduate degree, 74.1% were working in adult oncology units, and 52.4% of them were working as clinical nurses, 48.1% of the nurses received education for COVID-19 (51.9% did not receive) and 70.3% followed and read the COVID-19 Guidelines published by the Ministry of Health (29.7% did not follow guidelines). Using multiple regression analysis, a model based on the relationship between the variables was created. In the model, the descriptive characteristics of the oncology nurses and their experiences of COVID-19 were found to explain 29.1% of their knowledge level for COVID-19. Nurses' education level, the presence of a relative diagnosed with COVID-19, and following the COVID-19 guidelines were found to statistically significantly affect the knowledge levels of COVID-19. Conclusion: These findings suggest that hospital management and the Ministry of Health should provide more information for the oncology nurses to better control of cancer patients from the infectious disease.",covid
"The pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 challenges medical care systems all around the world. We here describe our experiences during the treatment of COVID-19 patients (n = 42) treated from 2 March 2020 to 16 April 2020 at a German district hospital. Forty-two COVID-19 patients were hospitalized and five patients developed a severe disease, requiring intensive care. Overall, 11 out of 42 hospitalized patients died. COVID-19 caused lymphocytopenia, as well as increased d-dimer, c-reactive protein and creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. These changes were mostly pronounced in patients that developed a severe disease course. Radiologic findings included ground-glass opacity, bilateral/multilobular involvement, consolidation, and posterior involvement. We compared COVID-19 patients to an average population of 'non-COVID' patients. Interestingly, no laboratory or radiologic finding was specific for COVID-19 when standing alone, as comorbidities of 'non-COVID' patients certainly can mimic similar results. In common praxis, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on a positive PCR result. However, a false-negative result causes problems for the workflow of an entire hospital. In our clinic, the consequences of a false assumption of SARS-CoV-2 negativity in four cases had dramatic consequences, as contact persons had to be quarantined. To avoid this, a comprehensive view of lab-results, radiology, clinical symptoms and comorbidities is necessary for the correct diagnosis or exclusion of COVID-19.",covid
"This article contributes to the assessment of public policies to control the incidence of COVID-19 in several ways. (1) It contains a brief historical and comparative overview of selected pandemics, particularly in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) It provides a simple original model which could be used to prioritize the admission of COVID-19 sufferers to hospital (taking into account available hospital capacity) and (3) it specifies a second model to evaluate desired social choices involving the trade-off between the severity of social restrictions (taking into account their impact on the incidence of COVID-19) and the level of economic activity. Bergson-type welfare functions are utilized in the second model. It also critically examines the proposition that the isolation (lockdown) of social groups is a desirable method of limiting the incidence of COVID-19. This leads onto the consideration of the extent to which personal freedom of choice (liberty) ought to be restricted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A brief outline follows illustrating the factors that are likely to hinder economic recovery from COVID-19. Particular attention is paid to the moral and ethical questions raised by policies to control COVID-19. These appear to have received little attention in the relevant economic literature.",covid
"Background and aims: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a significant impact on all aspects of life. One of the comorbidities associated with severe outcome and mortality of COVID-19 is diabetes. Metformin is one of the drugs which is most commonly used for the treatment of diabetes patients. This study aims to analyze the potential benefit of metformin use in reducing the mortality rate from COVID-19 infection. Methods: We systematically searched the Google Scholar database using specific keywords related to our aims until August 3rd, 2020. All articles published on COVID-19 and metformin were retrieved. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 software. Results: A total of 5 studies with a total of 6937 patients were included in our analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that metformin use is associated with reduction in mortality rate from COVID-19 infections [RR 0.54 (95% CI 0.32-0.90), p = 0.02, I 2 = 54%, random-effect modelling]. Conclusion: Metformin has shown benefits in reducing the mortality rate from COVID-19 infections. Patients with diabetes should be advised to continue taking metformin drugs despite COVID-19 infection status.",covid
"Background & aims: Nowadays, the whole World is under threat of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many fatalities and forced scientific communities to foster their Research and Development (R&D) activities. As a result, there is an enormous growth of scholarly literature on the subject. We here in this study have assessed the Indian publications contributions on COVID-19. Methods: WHO is curating global scientific literature on coronavirus since it declared COVID-19 a global pandemic through Global Research Database on COVID-19. The present study analyzed Indian publications on SARS-CoV-2 as found in WHO COVID-19 database. The research data was restricted for the period of March 2, 2020 to May 12, 2020. Results: The study found that there is a considerable and constant growth of Indian publications on COVID-19 from mid-April. It is interesting to note that, the most prolific authors belong to either AIIMS or ICMR institutes. Delhi state contributed highest number of publications on COVID-19. The AIIMS, New Delhi was the most productive institution in terms of publications. The Indian Journal of Medical Research has emerged as the productive journal contributing highest number of the publications. In terms of research area, the majority of the publications were related to Epidemiology. Conclusions: The highly cited publications were of evidenced based studies. It is observed that the studies pertaining to virology, diagnosis and treatment, clinical features etc. have received highest citations than general studies on epidemiology or pandemic.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a clinical course predominated by acute respiratory failure due to viral pneumonia with possible acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, nearly one third of infected patients, especially those with preexisting cardiovascular (CV) disease, are reported to present with some combination of acute cardiac injury, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or significant dysrhythmias. In addition, COVID-19 infections are also associated with high rates of thromboembolic and disseminated intravascular coagulation complications. Severe myocarditis and heart failure have both been reported as the initial presenting conditions in COVID-19 infection. This review highlights the important considerations related to the CV manifestations of COVID-19 infections, describes the mechanisms and clinical presentation of CV injury, and provides practical management and therapy suggestions. This narrative review is based primarily on the multiple case series and cohorts from the largest initial COVID-19 outbreak centers (ie, Wuhan, China, and Italy); hence, nearly all presented data and findings are retrospective in nature with the attendant limitations of such reports.",covid
"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide. While there are presently a few case reports/series on COVID-19 amongst solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, there is no official guideline for the management of SOT patients. Areas covered: The authors discuss the pharmacotherapeutic management of SOT patients during the COVID-19 outbreak and provide their expert perspectives. Expert opinion: Prophylactic reduction of immunosuppression because of fear of COVID-19 is not suggested in SOT patients. With maintenance immunosuppressive regimens, corticosteroids can be continued during COVID-19. Continuing other immunosuppressive drugs with lowest effective dose/blood concentration is suggested for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Discontinuation of antimetabolites and perhaps inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is suggested in moderate to severe COVID-19. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) may be continued or substituted for mTOR inhibitors with lowest therapeutic concentrations in moderate to severe COVID-19. If continued in patients with COVID-19, therapeutic drug monitoring of CNIs/mTOR inhibitors and appropriate dose reduction is recommended in co-administration with protease inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, or interleukin (IL)-1/IL-6 receptor antagonists. Complete blood count monitoring is recommended in patients who continue taking antimetabolites or mTOR inhibitors. Dose modification/avoidance should be considered for chloroquine, atazanavir, oseltamivir, ribavirin, anakinra, and Janus associated kinase inhibitors in patients with organ function impairment.",covid
"Introduction: The Pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has put a strain on the most of health systems all over the world. Many hospitals had to re-organize to deal with the emergency, so that the non-core activities have been suspended or cancelled, raising management problems. The aim of this multicentre study is to report the epidemiological orthopaedic and traumatological data between COVID and pre-COVID era and to analyse patients' needs and their management. Methods: We reported and compared traumatological and elective orthopaedic surgeries performed in three of the main hospital centres in Tuscany during COVID (March 2020) and pre-COVID (March 2019) era. We also reported the epidemiological data about the number of orthopaedic first aid visits at the main hub, analysing the main differences. For each centre, we reported the number, diagnosis, co-morbidities, treatment, hospital course, complications and outcomes of confirmed COVID 19 patients. We also indicated what kind of PPE were used by medical staff and patients at any visit. Results: The scheduled surgery drastically decreased in all the centres and the most of procedures were carried out for tumours, infections and implant mobilizations during the COVID time, delaying all the other ones. Trauma activities slightly decreased between the two time points: proximal femur fractures continued to engage our hospitals at the same pre-COVID volumes, while minor traumas drastically decreased. We report a decrease of 70.95% in orthopaedic first aid, with first-aid-visits/hospitalization ratio of 13.8 in the pre-COVID time vs 5.8 in the COVID time. A total of 5 confirmed COVID patients were treated for fractures and 4 of them healed without complications. We report just one case of death among COVID patients. All the medical staff members have worn the PPE and no one have developed COVID symptoms. Conclusions: The COVID-19 raised many important issues, such as the optimal management of patients requiring the treatment of conventional diseases during a pandemic. The flow of patients changes from one area to another during a pandemic and an integrated approach within the same geographical area could be useful to better allocate resources and manage the patients' needs. The preventive measures put in place in our country seem to work, but this first experience with COVID-19 crisis highlighted the chronic problems of our health system and we believe that we have to ""learn the lesson"" to be better prepared in the future.",covid
"Chest computed tomography (CT) becomes an effective tool to assist the diagnosis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide, using the computed-aided diagnosis technique for COVID-19 classification based on CT images could largely alleviate the burden of clinicians. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Selection guided Deep Forest (AFS-DF) for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT images. Specifically, we first extract location-specific features from CT images. Then, in order to capture the high-level representation of these features with the relatively small-scale data, we leverage a deep forest model to learn high-level representation of the features. Moreover, we propose a feature selection method based on the trained deep forest model to reduce the redundancy of features, where the feature selection could be adaptively incorporated with the COVID-19 classification model. We evaluated our proposed AFS-DF on COVID-19 dataset with 1495 patients of COVID-19 and 1027 patients of community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and AUC achieved by our method are 91.79%, 93.05%, 89.95% and 96.35%, respectively. Experimental results on the COVID-19 dataset suggest that the proposed AFS-DF achieves superior performance in COVID-19 vs. CAP classification, compared with 4 widely used machine learning methods.",covid
"Objective: Following the outbreak of novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease named COVID-19, in Wuhan, China in late 2019, countries have implemented different interventions such as travel bans to slow the spread of this novel virus. This brief report evaluates the effect of travel bans imposed to prevent COVID-19 importation in the Australian context. Methods: We developed a stochastic meta-population model to capture the global dynamics and spread of COVID-19. By adjusting our model to capture the travel bans imposed globally and in Australia, the predicted COVID-19 cases imported to Australia were evaluated in comparison to observed imported cases. Results: Our modelling results closely aligned with observed cases in Australia and elsewhere. We observed a 79% reduction in COVID-19 importation and a delay of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia by approximately one month. Further projection of COVID-19 to May 2020 showed spread patterns depending on the basic reproduction number. Conclusion: Imposing the travel ban was effective in delaying widespread transmission of COVID-19. However, strengthening of the domestic control measures is needed to prevent Australia from becoming another epicentre. Implications for public health: This report has shown the importance of border closure to pandemic control.",covid

"Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess whether the computed tomography (CT) features of COVID-19 (COVID+) ARDS differ from those of non-COVID-19 (COVID-) ARDS patients. Materials and methods: The study is a single-center prospective observational study performed on adults with ARDS onset ≤72 h and a PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mmHg. CT scans were acquired at PEEP set using a PEEP-FiO2 table with VT adjusted to 6 ml/kg predicted body weight. Results: 22 patients were included, of whom 13 presented with COVID-19 ARDS. Lung weight was significantly higher in COVID- patients, but all COVID+ patients presented supranormal lung weight values. Noninflated lung tissue was significantly higher in COVID- patients (36 ± 14% vs. 26 ± 15% of total lung weight at end-expiration, p < 0.01). Tidal recruitment was significantly higher in COVID- patients (20 ± 12 vs. 9 ± 11% of VT, p < 0.05). Lung density histograms of 5 COVID+ patients with high elastance (type H) were similar to those of COVID- patients, while those of the 8 COVID+ patients with normal elastance (type L) displayed higher aerated lung fraction.",covid
"Background: Dialysis patients are at risk of severe COVID-19. We managed COVID-19 haemodialysis outpatients in dedicated satellite dialysis units. This provided rare opportunity to study early disease progress in community-based patients. We aimed to (1) understand COVID-19 progression, (2) identify markers of future clinical severity and (3) assess associations between dialysis management strategies and COVID-19 clinical outcomes. Methods: We conducted a cohort study of all outpatients managed at a COVID-19 haemodialysis unit. We analysed data recorded as part of providing COVID-19 clinical care. We analysed associations between features at diagnosis and the first 3 consecutive haemodialysis sessions in patients who required future hospital admission, and those who had died at 28 days. Results: Isolated outpatient haemodialysis was provided to 106 patients over 8 weeks. No patients received antiviral medication or hydroxychloroquine. 21 patients (20%) were admitted at COVID-19 diagnosis. 29 of 85 patients (34%) were admitted after initial outpatient management. 16 patients (15%) died. By multivariate analysis, non-active transplant list status, use of institutional transport, and increased white cell count associated with future hospitalisation and increased age associated with death. Oxygen saturations progressively decreased over the first 3 dialysis sessions in the cohorts who progressed to future hospital admission or death. Mean ultrafiltration volume of the first three haemodialysis sessions was reduced in the same cohorts. Conclusions: Outpatient haemodialysis in patients with COVID-19 is safe for patients and staff. Features at the first 3 dialysis sessions can identify individuals at risk of future hospitalisation and death from COVID-19.",covid
"Background: As the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread, information about COVID-19 and skin disease or related biologics is still lacking. Objective: We aimed to identify the association between COVID-19 and skin diseases or biologics. Method: A nationwide claim dataset relevant to COVID-19 in South Korea was analysed. This dataset included insurance claim data before and during COVID-19 treatment and clinical outcomes. Claim data related to skin diseases and relevant biologics were analysed to figure out the association of COVID-19 with skin diseases and relevant biologics. Results: The dataset contained a total of 234,427 (M/F: 111,947/122,480) subjects who underwent COVID-19 testing. Of them, 7,590 (3.2%) were confirmed as COVID-19 (+), and 227 (3.0%) confirmed patients died. Amongst various skin diseases and biologics, no significant increase in the presence of specific skin diseases or exposure to biologics was observed in the COVID-19 (+) group, even after adjusting for or matching covariates. The presence of skin diseases and exposure to biologics also did not seem to affect clinical outcomes including mortality. Conclusions: Underlying skin diseases did not appear to increase susceptibility to COVID-19 or mortality from COVID-19. Considering the risks and benefits, biologics for dermatologic conditions might be continuously used during the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Background: Ureteral stone disease may be an emergent condition if the appropriate management is not performed in a timely manner. As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread globally, isolation and restriction orders taken by the governments have become the cores to control the pandemic. In this study, we, therefore, aimed to investigate the ureteral stone presentations in a high-volume university hospital during the COVID-19 restriction order period. Materials and Methods: The data of 149 patients who were hospitalized due to ureteral stone both during the COVID-19 pandemic restriction period and the corresponding period (non-COVID-19) of the previous year were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Unpaired Student's t-test was used to compare continuous variables. The categorical data were assessed using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Results: Of 149 patients, 35 were hospitalized in the COVID-19 restrictions period. While the mean age and the stone characteristics of the two groups did not differ significantly, serum creatinine levels (1.9 ± 1.85 vs 1.15 ± 0.64) and the white blood cell counts (12.45 ± 6.54 vs 8.21 ± 4.15) at hospital admission were significantly higher in the COVID-19 restrictions group (p = 0.034 and p = 0.005, respectively). According to the priority classification recommendations of the European Urology Guidelines Office Rapid Reaction Group for urolithiasis applicable during the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant difference was observed between the two periods (X2 = 9.907, p = 0.019). In particular, the rate of emergency cases was found more than threefold in the COVID-19 period. Although there was no significant difference in terms of the grade of hydronephrosis at hospital admission between the two groups, the rates of grade 3 and 4 hydronephrosis were higher in the COVID-period group (1.8- and 3.3-fold, respectively). Conclusion: The rate of complicated ureteral stone disease significantly increased during the COVID-19 restrictions period. Urologists should prioritize the patients most in need of urgent care during COVID-19-like biosocial crisis.",covid
"This study aimed to determine the association between average temperature and humidity with COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. This study included 9,455 confirmed cases during the observation period (March 08, 2020 to May 03, 2020). The peak spread of COVID-19 occurred at an average temperature of 26 °C. We find, under a linear regression framework, high temperature and high humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19, respectively. It indicates that the arrival of summer and rainy season in Bangladesh can effectively reduce the transmission of the COVID-19. However, it is unlikely that the COVID-19 pandemic diminishes by summer since Bangladesh still have a high coronavirus transmission. Therefore, other public health interventions such as social distancing are still important for blocking the COVID-19 transmission.",covid
"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak generated an unprecedented set of emotional challenges for women diagnosed with breast cancer. In the United Kingdom (UK), the pandemic significantly disrupted oncology services as resources were reassigned to care for COVID-19 patients. In addition to service disruptions, many women received a UK Government letter advising them to shield for 12-weeks. We aimed to explore the effect of disruption to scheduled oncology services and the UK Government shielding letter on emotional and cognitive vulnerability. A further aim was to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 related emotional vulnerability (COVID-EMV) and anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function. Women diagnosed with primary breast cancer (N = 234) completed a series of online questionnaires to assess their cognitive and emotional wellbeing as well as their COVID-EMV. Results indicated that disrupted oncology services had a significant impact on COVID-EMV, anxiety and depression, with those experiencing disruptions expressing higher general emotional vulnerability as well as COVID-EMV. Further, the UK Government letter had a significant effect on perceived cognitive function; those who received the letter reported poorer cognitive function. Regression analyses revealed that after allowing for the effects of sociodemographic and clinical variables, women's COVID-EMV significantly predicted worse outcomes of anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function. Our findings indicate that concerns about COVID-19 amongst women affected by breast cancer leads to increased risk of developing affective disorder, such as anxiety and depression symptomatology, among this sample. We advocate the rapid implementation of accessible interventions designed to promote emotional resilience in the breast cancer population.",covid
"Pregnant women are a potentially highly vulnerable population due to anatomical, physiological and immunological changes under the Covid-19 pandemic. Issues related to pregnancy with Covid-19 attracted widespread attention from researchers. A large number of articles were published aiming to elaborate clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women infected with Covid-19, in order to provide evidence for management. The existing data suggest that the overall prognosis of pregnancy with Covid-19 is promising when compared with that of other previous coronaviruses. There is still maternal morbidity and mortality related to Covid-19 reported. However, the optimal management of severe and critically ill cases of Covid-19-infected-pregnancy is poorly clarified. The possibility of postpartum exacerbation in pregnancy with Covid-19 is also worthy of attention for obstetricians. This review makes further elaboration of the above issues.",covid
"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) globally threatens the public health. COVID-19 is a pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Typical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and fatigue. As a novel disease, there are still many unsolved questions regarding COVID-19. Nevertheless, genetic analysis has demonstrated that the virus is strongly associated with certain SARS-like coronavirus originated from bats. The COVID-19 outbreak started in a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China, but the exact origin of the virus is still highly debatable. Since there is currently no registered antiviral drug for the disease, symptomatic treatments have been applied routinely to manage COVID-19 cases. However, various drugs and vaccines have been currently under research. This review aims to consolidate and discuss the likely origins and genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the recent clinical findings and potential effective treatments of COVID-19.

"Aim: The first Covid-19 cases were reported in Malaysia on 25 January 2019 followed by a quiescent period before an upward swing of the cases at the end of February 2020, partly attributed to mass gathering during a religious event. This short communication aims to provide an overview of the measures taken by the Malaysian Government in response to Covid-19, and of the effectiveness of the Movement Control Order. Subjects and methods: This short communication reviews articles and government announcements related to containment measures and the Movement Control Order of Malaysia, and graphically presents data pertinent to Covid-19 in Malaysia in order to show the relationship between fluctuations in Covid-19 cases and movement control. Results: At the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak, Malaysia had initiated travel restrictions and quarantine; but with a persistent increase in new Covid-19 cases, the Movement Control Order was finally rolled out on 18 March 2020, requiring closure of all businesses except those providing essential services and items. Enforcement of the order was tightened progressively, resulting in significant improvement of compliance, while other interventions such as tracking of potential contacts and medical screening were underway, and the media continued to provide updates and general advices. The numbers of new and active Covid-19 cases started showing evident downtrends from mid-April, thus indicating the effectiveness of movement control and its compliance. Conclusion: The article provides insight into crucial factors contributing to the success of movement control to effectively contain Covid-19, and highlights the need to prevent future upsurge through continuous monitoring and enforcement.",covid
"Objective: To describe differences in outcomes between pregnant women with and without coronavirus dsease 2019 (COVID-19). Design: Prospective cohort study of pregnant women consecutively admitted for delivery, and universally tested via nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. All infants of mothers with COVID-19 underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. Setting: Three New York City hospitals. Population: Pregnant women >20 weeks of gestation admitted for delivery. Methods: Data were stratified by SARS-CoV-2 result and symptomatic status, and were summarised using parametric and nonparametric tests. Main outcome measures: Prevalence and outcomes of maternal COVID-19, obstetric outcomes, neonatal SARS-CoV-2, placental pathology. Results: Of 675 women admitted for delivery, 10.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 78.6% were asymptomatic. We observed differences in sociodemographics and comorbidities among women with symptomatic COVID-10 versus asymptomatic COVID-19 versus no COVID-19. Caesarean delivery rates were 46.7% in symptomatic COVID-19, 45.5% in asymptomatic COVID-19 and 30.9% in women without COVID-19 (P = 0.044). Postpartum complications (fever, hypoxia, readmission) occurred in 12.9% of women with COVID-19 versus 4.5% of women without COVID-19 (P < 0.001). No woman required mechanical ventilation, and no maternal deaths occurred. Among 71 infants tested, none were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Placental pathology demonstrated increased frequency of fetal vascular malperfusion, indicative of thrombi in fetal vessels, in women with COVID-19 versus women without COVID-19 (48.3% versus 11.3%, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Among pregnant women with COVID-19 at delivery, we observed increased caesarean delivery rates and increased frequency of maternal complications in the postpartum period. Additionally, intraplacental thrombi may have maternal and fetal implications for COVID-19 remote from delivery. Tweetable abstract: COVID-19 at delivery: more caesarean deliveries, postpartum complications and intraplacental thrombi.",covid
"COVID-19, an emerging infectious disease, has quickly spread all over the world. All human populations are susceptible to this disease. Here we present two pediatric COVID-19 cases, both of whom exhibited negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests upon nasopharyngeal swab and were initially diagnosed with influenza A infection. COVID-19 was later confirmed in both patients by serum antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 and nucleic acid test on stool samples. Because children are susceptible to many respiratory pathogens, especially influenza, we concluded that children can be coinfected with multiple pathogens, and more attention should be paid to the exploration of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic of COVID-19. This report shows the possibility of misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis of children with COVID-19. We suggest that highly suspected pediatric COVID-19 cases with negative nucleic acid tests on nasopharyngeal swabs should be further checked by performing a nucleic acid test on stool samples and testing serum for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.",covid
"Nowadays, a significant number of infectious diseases such as human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are threatening the world by spreading at an alarming rate. Some of the literatures pointed out that the pandemic is exhibiting seasonal patterns in its spread, incidence and nature of the distribution. In connection to the spread and distribution of the infection, scientific analysis that answers the questions whether the next summer can save people from COVID-19 is required. Many researchers have been exclusively asked whether high temperature during summer can slow down the spread of the COVID-19 as it has with other seasonal flues. Since there are a lot of questions that are unanswered right now, and many mysteries aspects about the COVID-19 that is still unknown to us, in-depth study and analysis of associated weather features are required. Moreover, understanding the nature of COVID-19 and forecasting the spread of COVID-19 request more investigation of the real effect of weather variables on the transmission of the COVID-19 among people. In this work, various regressor machine learning models are proposed to extract the relationship between different factors and the spreading rate of COVID-19. The machine learning algorithms employed in this work estimate the impact of weather variables such as temperature and humidity on the transmission of COVID-19 by extracting the relationship between the number of confirmed cases and the weather variables on certain regions. To validate the proposed method, we have collected the required datasets related to weather and census features and necessary prepossessing is carried out. From the experimental results, it is shown that the weather variables are more relevant in predicting the mortality rate when compared to the other census variables such as population, age, and urbanization. Thus, from this result, we can conclude that temperature and humidity are important features for predicting COVID-19 mortality rate. Moreover, it is indicated that the higher the value of temperature the lower number of infection cases.",covid
"Objectives: CT findings of COVID-19 look similar to other atypical and viral (non-COVID-19) pneumonia diseases. This study proposes a clinical computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using CT features to automatically discriminate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Methods: Overall, 612 patients (306 COVID-19 and 306 non-COVID-19 pneumonia) were recruited. Twenty radiological features were extracted from CT images to evaluate the pattern, location, and distribution of lesions of patients in both groups. All significant CT features were fed in five classifiers namely decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and ensemble to evaluate the best performing CAD system in classifying COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. Results: Location and distribution pattern of involvement, number of the lesion, ground-glass opacity (GGO) and crazy-paving, consolidation, reticular, bronchial wall thickening, nodule, air bronchogram, cavity, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and lymphadenopathy are the significant features to classify COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups. Our proposed CAD system obtained the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.965, 93.54%, 90.32%, and 91.94%, respectively, using ensemble (COVIDiag) classifier. Conclusions: This study proposed a COVIDiag model obtained promising results using CT radiological routine features. It can be considered an adjunct tool by the radiologists during the current COVID-19 pandemic to make an accurate diagnosis. Key points: • Location and distribution of involvement, number of lesions, GGO and crazy-paving, consolidation, reticular, bronchial wall thickening, nodule, air bronchogram, cavity, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and lymphadenopathy are the significant features between COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups. • The proposed CAD system, COVIDiag, could diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia cases with an AUC of 0.965 (sensitivity = 93.54%; specificity = 90.32%; and accuracy = 91.94%). • The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy obtained by radiologist diagnosis are 0.879, 87.10%, 88.71%, and 87.90%, respectively.",covid
"The 2019 outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has had a devastating impact. Given the on-going nature of the outbreak, the deleterious toll on mental health, including substance use, is unknown. Negative reinforcement models of substance use posit that elevations in stress from the COVID-19 pandemic will elicit a corresponding motivation to downregulate COVID-19-related stress reactivity via substance use for a subset of the population. The current study sought to evaluate: (1) if COVID-19-related worry and fear were associated with substance use coping motives; and (2) how levels of COVID-19-related worry and fear differ between pre-COVID-19 substance users, COVID-19 substance initiators, and abstainers. Participants were 160 adults recruited nationally between April-May 2020 for an online study. Results indicated that COVID-19-related worry was associated with substance use coping motives. Additionally, compared to abstainers, pre-COVID-19 substance users and COVID-19 substance initiators demonstrated the highest levels of worry and fear. Examination of differences suggested that the COVID-19 substance initiators had the highest COVID-19-related worry and fear for all substances except for opioids, with effect size estimates ranging from small to medium. The results of this study suggest that COVID-19-specific psychological factors appear to be involved in substance use behavior.",covid
"Introduction: In clinical trial for the Ebola virus, the broad-spectrum anti-viral agent remdesivir was shown to have a good safety profile. Remdesivir is now being tested in severe COVID-19. Areas covered: The Gilead Sciences SIMPLE trial suggests that the short-term use of remdesivir probably does not increase mortality dramatically or have serious short-term toxicity when used to treat severe COVID-19. The Adaptive COVID-19 treatment trials (ACTT1) trial showed that remdesivir may shorten recovery and decrease mortality in severe COVID-19 without increasing adverse effects. Expert opinion: It seems to me that we have learnt very little from the SIMPLE trial, and this would be predicted from a trial that has no control or placebo group. The results of ACTT1 were reported early after an interim analysis showed that a higher than expected number of recoveries had occurred. There was an indication that remdesivir may be reducing mortality, but this was no statistical significance. The trial is continuing, and the final data are eagerly awaited to determine whether remdesivir is a game-changing remedy or a ripple in the ongoing search for a medicine for the treatment of COVID-19.",covid
"Introduction: Italy has been the first European country severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: To analyze the incidence of the clinical presentations suggestive for COVID-19 infection among patients with Multiple Sclerosis in the province of Lecco, in the North Italy, the closest province capital to Bergamo. To describe the association of demographics, clinical characteristics, and use of DMTs categories with the risk of contracting the disease. Methods: We telephonically interviewed all the 275 MS patients followed in the MS center. The collected data included recent contact with a patient with COVID-19 diagnosis or a subject with respiratory symptoms and the developing of COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed diagnosis. Results: 15 out of 275 patients reported symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 infection, only one of them with PCR-confirmed diagnosis. No one of them presented severe symptoms or needed hospitalization. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, the only factor associated with being in the COVID-suspect group was the report of a recent contact with a patient with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Conclusions: The prevalence of COVID-19 within MS patients seems to resemble the prevalence in general population. The lack of associations with other factors assessed, including DMTs, may reflect a lack of statistical power. Larger population studies are needed to explore the correlation between different disease-modifying therapies and COVID-19 course.",covid
"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has substantially affected patients with dementia and their caregivers. However, we found not all Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients were afraid of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, we investigated the association between rate of awareness of COVID-19 and depressive tendency in AD. 126 consecutive outpatients with AD were enrolled in this study from May 25, on the day when the declaration of emergency was lifted in Japan, through June 30, 2020. In addition to routine psychological tests, the participants were asked the following two questions: ""Do you know COVID-19?"" and ""Why are you wearing a face mask?"". Moderate to severe AD patients were found to have a low COVID-19 recognition rate and did not fully understand why they were wearing face masks. In addition, because they did not understand the seriousness of the COVID-19 outbreak, their Geriatric Depression Scale scores were also substantially lower. These results may appear to simply indicate that people with severe dementia are unaware of current events. However, these results provide insights into how to care for patients with dementia and how to allocate the time and support of our limited staff during the COVID-19 outbreak.",covid
"Background: The COVID 19 pandemic increased publication productivity enormously with numerous new COVID-19-related articles appearing daily, despite the fact that many health care workers in the partially overburdened national health care systems were faced with major challenges. Methods: In a cross-sectional, observational, retrospective study we compared and correlated 17 epidemiologic, health care system-related and health-economic factors from medical databases and intergovernmental organisations potentially influencing the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 publication productivity between 1 January and 30 April 2020 amongst the 30 countries most severely affected by the pandemic. These factors were additionally correlated with the national pre-COVID-19 publication rate for the same pre-year period to identify potential changes in the general publication behaviour. Findings: COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 publication rates correlated strongest with access to and quality of health care (ρ = 0.80 and 0.87, p < 0.0001), COVID-19 cases per capita (ρ = 0.78 and 0.72, p < 0.0001), GDP per capita (ρ = 0.69 and 0.76, p < 0.0001), health spending per capita (ρ = 0.61 and 0.73, p < 0.0001) and the pre-COVID-19 Hirsch-Index (ρ = 0.61 and 0.62, p = 0.002 and <0.0001). Ratios of publication rates for ""Cancer"", ""Diabetes"" and ""Stroke"" in 2020 versus the pre-year period were 0.88 ± 0.06, 1.02 ± 0.18 and 0.9 ± 0.20, resulting in a pooled ratio of 0.93 ± 0.06 for non-COVID-19 publications. Interpretation: There are marked geographic and national differences in publication productivity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both COVID-19- and non-COVID-19 publication productivity correlates with epidemiologic, health care system-related and healtheconomic factors, and pre-COVID publication expertise. Countries with a stable scientific infrastructure appear to maintain non-COVID-19 publication productivity nearly at the pre-year level and at the same time use their resilience to produce COVID-19 publications at high rates.",covid

"This investigation employed the Asymmetric Power GARCH model and found that COVID-19 substantially harms the US and Japan's market returns. Moreover, COVID-19 has influenced the variance of the US, Germany, and Italy's stock markets more than the Global Financial Crises (GFC). However, GFC indicated a more significant impact on the financial volatility of the Nikkei 225 index and SSEC than COVID-19. The study confirmed the leverage effect for the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite Index, DAX 30, Nikkei 225, FTSE MIB, and SSEC. The analysis authenticated that the health crisis that befell due to COVID-19 have imperatively originated the financial crisis globally; however, the Asian markets still make available better prospects for portfolio optimization.",covid
"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a deep impact on our surgical practice and scientific publishing output. Methods: The 100 best-ranked ""surgery journals"" were selected. The contents of the March, April, May, and June 2020 issues and ahead-of-print articles were screened. The retrieved articles on COVID-19 were separated into two categories: ""opinion articles"" and ""scientific articles,"" i.e., randomized trials and original articles with structured methods and results. The number of COVID articles published in the TOP-10 journals was compared with that of COVID articles published elsewhere. Results: There were 59 COVID original articles (8%). The great majority of articles were opinion articles (83.4%). Almost 40% of COVID articles were published in the TOP-10 journals. Conclusion: Original COVID articles (the core of our knowledge) are scant. Faced with a novel disease, neither the authors nor the editors should be criticized regarding this situation. The future step should be to publish high-quality papers in the setting of a major health crisis.",covid
"The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has been a global concern since its outbreak, where the number of COVID-19 cases is also on a rapid surge in Bangladesh with the report of a total of 178,443 cases after the detection of the first three cases in this country on 8 March 2020. From the beginning, the Bangladesh government has taken different initiatives to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, though the government has reduced the restrictions from public life by lifting shut down and re-opening to keep sustained the economy of the country.

"Background and aims: Cardiac biomarkers like cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We propose an algorithmic approach using cardiac biomarkers to triage, risk-stratify and prognosticate patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases until May 31st, 2020, and accessed the available data on the role of cardiac biomarkers in patients with COVID-19. Results: COVID-19 is associated with acute cardiac injury in around 7-28% of patients, significantly increasing its associated complications and mortality. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are more prone to develop acute cardiac injury as a result of COVID-19. The use of cardiac biomarkers may aid in differentiating the cardiac cause of dyspnea in patients with severe COVID-19. Cardiac biomarkers may also aid in triaging, risk-stratification, clinical decision-making, and prognostication of patients with COVID-19. However, there are concerns that routine testing in all patients with COVID-19 irrespective of severity, may result in unnecessary downstream investigations which may be misleading. In this brief review, using an algorithmic approach, we have tried to rationalize the use of cardiac biomarkers among patients with severe COVID-19. This approach is also likely to lessen the infection exposure risk to the cardiovascular team attending patients with severe COVID-19. Conclusion: It appears beneficial to triage, risk-stratify, and prognosticate patients with COVID-19 based on the evidence of myocardial injury and the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease. Future research studies are, however, needed to validate these proposed benefits.",covid
"The rapid spread of COVID-19 motivated countries worldwide to mitigate mortality through actions including social distancing, home quarantine, school closures, and case isolation. We estimate the global mortality benefits of these actions. We use county-level data on COVID-19 from January 2020, project the number of mortalities until September 2020, and calculate the global mortality benefits using the age- and country-specific value of a statistical life (VSL). Implementing all four types of actions above would save approximately 40.76 trillion USD globally, with social distancing accounting for 55% of the benefits. The monetary benefit would be the largest in the US, Japan and China. Our findings indicate that global actions during COVID-19 have substantial economic benefits and must be implemented in response to COVID-19.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had been declared as a global pandemic by WHO. During the pandemic, a suspicion of COVID-19 infection could be found on patients presented with clinical symptoms of COVID-19. However, several new clinical symptoms of COVID-19 had also been reported recently. This caused difficulties to identify COVID-19 based on the clinical symptoms only. Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was absolutely needed to determine the correct diagnosis. We report a family cluster of COVID-19 with different clinical manifestations to show a potential COVID-19 transmission in person who has no symptoms initially but may develop symptoms later as the incubation period varies from 5-14 days. This asymptomatic person remains potential to transmit the virus. This report describes the epidemiological, clinical, radiological, laboratory findings, and different clinical manifestation of a family cluster of COVID-19 case in Indonesia. COVID-19 was transmitted from asymptomatic person in the incubation period.",covid
"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is an emerging pandemic with heightened concerns for people with compromised immune systems, including people living with HIV. Purpose: In the absence of a vaccine, public health messaging to mitigate risks for COVID-19 primarily focuses on social distancing. Because people living with HIV commonly experience mistreatment associated with HIV, their response to social distancing may be complicated by psychosocial attitudes associated with COVID-19. Methods: To evaluate these relationships, we conducted a rapid-response, cross-sectional survey with people living with HIV (N = 149) to assess social distancing practices, COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, COVID-19 xenophobic attitudes, HIV microaggressions, and concern over contracting COVID-19. Data were collected from participants enrolled in a larger ongoing study between March 30, 2020 and April 17, 2020. Results: Results indicated that choosing to socially distance to reduce COVID-19 exposure was associated with COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, concerns of contracting COVID-19, and identifying as transgender. Likewise, social distancing imposed by others (e.g., cancelations and restrictions) was associated with concerns of contracting COVID-19. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate that social distancing measures are related to concerns of contracting the virus and discriminatory attitudes toward those who are presumed to be living with COVID-19. These potentially negative psychosocial attitudes toward people perceived to have COVID-19 echo the discriminatory actions and attitudes that we continue to observe in HIV social sciences research.",covid
"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) developed into a pandemic on March 11. COVID-19 not only brought life crisis, but also incurred psychological stress: tension, anxiety, fear and despair among affected populations. How to help people overcome traumatic stress reactions and get out of psychological crisis has become a public concern that needs to be resolved in time. This article reported the psychological responses caused by the COVID-19 epidemic in China based on relevant experience and studies. The anti-epidemic measures of self-quarantine and social-distancing were deployed to contain the spread of COVID-19, but inevitably caused a certain extent of side effect: frustration and anxiety in the general public. Especially, the front-line medical rescue staff and COVID-19 patients were more susceptible to developing psychological disorders. Correspondingly, adaptive strategies and public health policies were rapidly implemented in China to deal with outbreak-caused mental stress. The psychological impact of COVID-19 and coping strategies adopted in China provided warning and reference for countries that are and going to be affected by this natural disaster.",covid
"The current COVID-19 pandemic has shown a relevant rate of patients developing an acute respiratory distress syndrome that requires hospitalization. Approximately 3-17% of hospitalized patients require Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation. Initial recommendations advocated for early intubation, while early tracheotomy should not be routinely performed in COVID-19 patients. We report the case of a COVID-19 patient developing laryngo-tracheal stenosis secondary to an open surgical tracheotomy in the ICU. A conservative endoscopic management was not successful and we performed a laryngo-tracheal resection. The specimen was negative for COVID-19 but the pathological examination revealed how the virus damaged the trachea. This case is, as far as we are aware, the first case of laryngo-tracheal surgery in a COVID-19 patient and provides an insight to justify the higher rate of tracheal injuries occurring in intubated COVID-19 patients.",covid
"The Aim of this research is construct the SEIR model for COVID-19, Stability Analysis and numerical simulation of the SEIR model on the spread of COVID-19. The method used to construct the model is the SEIR model by considering vaccination and isolation factors as model parameters, the analysis of the model uses the generation matrix method to obtain the basic reproduction numbers and the global stability of the COVID-19 distribution model. Numerical simulation models use secondary data on the number of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia. The results obtained are the SEIR model for COVID-19; model analysis yields global stability from the spread of COVID-19; The results of the analysis also provide information if no vaccine, Indonesia is endemic COVID-19. Then the simulation results provide a prediction picture of the number of COVID-19 in Indonesia in the following days, the simulation results also show that the vaccine can accelerate COVID-19 healing and maximum isolation can slow the spread of COVID-19. The results obtained can be used as a reference for early prevention of the spread of COVID-19 in Indonesia.",covid

"Objective: Fear of COVID-19 was associated with more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms. This study aimed to explore COVID-19-related fear, depressive and anxiety symptoms, social responsibility, and behavioral responses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 10 to April 13, 2020. Members of the Greek general population completed anonymously an online survey, distributed through the social media. Among the 3,700 adult respondents, 3,029 fulfilled inclusion criteria. The survey included sociodemographic questions, questions exploring potential risk factors for increased fear of COVID-19, questions about the employment of safety and checking behaviors, and questions about compliance with public health guidelines. In addition, four psychometric scales were used, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and Steele's Social Responsibility Motivation scale. Multivariate General Linear Models (GLM) were used to depict significant differences among dependent variables (FCV-19S, PHQ-9, GAD-7) and independent variables (potential risk factors, safety and checking behaviors, compliance with guidelines). The relationship between the FCV-19S total score and influencing factors was quantified by linear regression analysis. Results: Several participants reported high levels of COVID-19-related fear (35.7%) and moderate to severe depressive symptoms (22.8%), while a significant proportion reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (77.4%). Women scored altogether significantly higher than men. Respondents under the age of 30 reported less fear and depressive symptoms and showed the least social responsibility. Based on GLM, a significant other's COVID-19 illness, being on psychiatric medication, employment of safety and checking behaviors, and compliance with guidelines were associated with higher COVID-19-related fear. Linear regression analysis revealed that gender, age, depressive, and anxiety symptoms modified levels of COVID-19-related fear. Conclusions: Greater behavioral responses to the pandemic, that is, excessive employment of safety/checking behaviors and greater compliance with guidelines, were shown to amplify fear, potentially due to increased contamination awareness. In addition, female gender, older age, and more severe anxiety symptoms were related with higher COVID-19-related fear. Describing and weighing carefully the psychosocial and behavioral impact of the pandemic will enable the implementation of both supportive and preventive interventions.",covid
"Introduction: COVID-19 is causing an enormous psychological burden for most people. This study aims to assess individual changes in mental health and health status before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore potential predictors of change. Methods: A cross-sectional study in Germany (n = 15 037) were conducted. Demographics, depression and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-2, GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L) were assessed. Additionally, all instruments used were adapted to measure the participants' mental health and health status before the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, and the subjective level of information about COVID-19 were examined. Results: Overall, the participants showed a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms, and distress, while health status deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. Impairment in mental health was predicted by COVID-19-related fear. Pre-existing mental illness predicted an increase in depression symptoms and a deterioration in health status. Trust in governmental actions and the subjective level of information predicted less increase in psychological burden. Conclusions: Our data revealed that there have been changes in mental health and health status at an individual level since the outbreak of COVID-19. In order to maintain mental health, the observed predictors should be addressed.",covid
"Background: The outbreak of highly contagious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to human life and health, especially for those with underlying diseases. However, the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on hemodialysis (HD) centers and HD patients has not been reported. Methods: We reviewed the whole course of the COVID-19 in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University (from January 14, 2020, to March 12, 2020). We compared the clinical manifestation and immune profiles among different patient groups with healthy individuals. Results: Forty-two of 230 HD patients (18.26%) and 4 of 33 medical staff (12.12%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. Fifteen HD patients (6.52%), including 10 COVID-19 diagnosed, died. Only 2 deaths of the COVID-19 HD patients were associated with pneumonia/lung failure, others were ascribed to cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases or hyperkalemia. Except for 3 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit for a severe condition (8.11%), including 2 who died, most COVID-19 diagnosed patients presented mild or nonrespiratory symptoms. The flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood showed that multiple lymphocyte populations in HD patients were significantly decreased. HD patients with COVID-19 even displayed more remarkable reduction of serum inflammatory cytokines than other patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: Compared with the general population, HD patients and health care professionals are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high-risk areas during the outbreak. Most HD patients with COVID-19 exhibited mild clinical symptoms and did not progress to severe pneumonia, likely due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokine storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.",covid
"Background: Transmission of COVID-19 in developing countries is expected to surpass that in developed countries; however, information on community perceptions of this new disease is scarce. The aim of the study was to identify possible misconceptions among males and females toward COVID-19 in Uganda using a rapid online survey distributed via social media. Methods: A cross-sectional survey carried out in early April 2020 was conducted with 161 Ugandans, who purposively participated in the online questionnaire that assessed understandings of COVID-19 risk and infection. Sixty-four percent of respondents were male and 36% were female. Results: We found significant divergences of opinion on gendered susceptibility to COVID-19. Most female respondents considered infection risk, symptoms, severe signs, and death to be equally distributed between genders. In contrast, male respondents believed they were more at risk of infection, severe symptoms, severe signs, and death (52.7 vs. 30.6%, RR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.14-2.8). Most women did not share this perception and disagreed that males were at higher risk of infection (by a factor of three), symptoms (79% disagree), severe signs (71%, disagree), and death (70.2% disagree). Overall, most respondents considered children less vulnerable (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.55-2.2) to COVID-19 than adults, that children present with less symptoms (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 0.77-3.19), and that there would be less mortality in children (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.41-1.88). Of female respondents, 76.4% considered mortality from COVID-19 to be different between the young and the elderly (RR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.01-2.92) and 92.7% believed young adults would show fewer signs than the elderly, and 71.4% agreed that elderly COVID-19 patients would show more severe signs than the young (OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.4, 4.8). While respondents considered that all races were susceptible to the signs and symptoms of infection as well as death from COVID-19, they considered mortality would be highest among white people from Europe and the USA. Some respondents (mostly male 33/102, 32.4%) considered COVID-19 to be a ""disease of whites"" (30.2%). Conclusion: The WHO has identified women and children in rural communities as vulnerable persons who should be given more attention in the COVID-19 national response programs across Africa; however, our study has found that men in Uganda perceive themselves to be at greater risk and that these contradictory perceptions (including the association of COVID-19 with ""the white"" race) suggest an important discrepancy in the communication of who is most vulnerable and why. Further research is urgently needed to validate and expand the results of this small exploratory study.",covid
"Background: The aim of this study was investigation of COVID-19 disease and its outcome in cancer patients who needed treatment, in a 90-day period. Methods: Cancer patient who required treatment, were evaluated for potential COVID-19 infection in a 90-day period, starting from beginning of this epidemic in Iran, January, to April 19, 2020. For treatment of solid tumor patients, if they did not have symptoms related to COVID-19, just chest X-ray was requested. If they showed COVID-19 related symptoms, high resolution CT scan of lungs was requested. For hematology cancer patients, PCR test for COVID-19 infection was requested as well. Protection measures were considered for personnel of oncology wards. Results: 279 Patients were followed up in this 90-day period. No COVID-19 infection was observed in 92 cases of breast cancer, 14 cases of gastric cancer and 12 cases of pancreaticobiliary cancer. However, in 72 cases of colon cancer, 11 cases of lung cancer, 5 cases brain tumors and 12 cases ovarian cancer; 4 cases of COVID-19 were observed. In the hematology cancers group, which included 14 cases of Hodgkin's disease, 23 cases of lymphoproliferative disorder, 12 cases of acute leukemia and 12 cases of multiple myeloma; 3 cases of COVID-19 were observed. Conclusion: Patients with cancer who need treatment can be treated by taking some measures. These measures include observing individual and collective protection principles in patients and health-care personnel, increasing patients' awareness particularly about self-care behavior, performing a COVID-19 test, and taking a chest X-ray, before the treatment starts.",covid
"Introduction: Due to the serious situation of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide, many countries have implemented policies to minimize the spread of COVID-19 infection. However, some of these policies prevent people from physical contact. Consequently, many individuals may rely on social media to obtain information concerning COVID-19. Unfortunately, social media use (especially problematic social media use) may give rise to psychological distress. Therefore, this study thus examined potential psychopathology to explain the association between problematic social media use, psychological distress, and insomnia. Methods: Utilizing an online survey, a sample of Iranian young adults (n = 1078 with 628 males; mean age = 26.24 years [SD ± 7.41]) completed questions and psychometric scales concerning psychological distress, insomnia, problematic social media use, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19 misunderstanding. Results: Problematic social media use was significantly associated with psychological distress both directly and indirectly. The indirect effects were through fear of COVID-19 (unstandardized coefficient [B] = 0.177; Bootstrapping SE = 0.026) and COVID-19 misunderstanding (B = 0.060; Bootstrapping SE = 0.014). Problematic social media use was significantly associated with insomnia both directly and indirectly. The indirect effect was through fear of COVID-19 (B = 0.062; Bootstrapping SE = 0.019) but not COVID-19 misunderstanding (B = 0.012; Bootstrapping SE = 0.014). Discussion/conclusion: Due to the pressure of the COVID-19 outbreak, individuals are highly likely to develop psychological distress and insomnia. Apart from developing appropriate health policies to minimize the spread of COVID-19 infection, healthcare providers should design appropriate online campaigns to eliminate people's fear of COVID-19 and to diminish misunderstanding concerning COVID-19.",covid
"Introduction: In March 2020, Australian state and federal governments introduced physical distancing measures alongside widespread testing to combat COVID-19. These measures may decrease people's sexual contacts and thus reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs). We investigated the impact of physical distancing measures due to COVID-19 on the sexual behaviour of gay and bisexual men (GBM) in Australia. Methods: Between April 4 and April 29 2020, 940 participants in an ongoing cohort study responded to questions to measure changes in sexual behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. Men reported the date they become concerned about COVID-19, and whether they engaged in sexual behaviour with regular or casual partners or 'fuckbuddies' in the six months prior to becoming concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as 'before COVID-19'), and following the date they become concerned about COVID-19 (hereafter referred to as 'since COVID-19'). Before and since COVID-19 was based on individual participants' own perceived date of becoming concerned about COVID-19. Results: Mean age of was 39.9 years (SD: 13.4). Most participants (88.3%) reported sex with other men during the six months before COVID-19. Of the 587 men (62.4%) who reported sex with casual partners before COVID-19, 93 (15.8%) continued to do so in the period since COVID-19, representing a relative reduction of 84.2%. Conclusion: GBM in Australia have dramatically reduced their sexual contacts with other men since COVID-19. These behavioural changes will likely result in short-term reductions in new HIV and STI diagnoses. If sexual health screenings are undertaken prior to resuming sexual activity, this could present a novel opportunity to interrupt chains of HIV and STI transmission.",covid
"Chest-X ray (CXR) radiography can be used as a first-line triage process for non-COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. However, the similarity between features of CXR images of COVID-19 and pneumonia caused by other infections make the differential diagnosis by radiologists challenging. We hypothesized that machine learning-based classifiers can reliably distinguish the CXR images of COVID-19 patients from other forms of pneumonia. We used a dimensionality reduction method to generate a set of optimal features of CXR images to build an efficient machine learning classifier that can distinguish COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases with high accuracy and sensitivity. By using global features of the whole CXR images, we were able to successfully implement our classifier using a relatively small dataset of CXR images. We propose that our COVID-Classifier can be used in conjunction with other tests for optimal allocation of hospital resources by rapid triage of non-COVID-19 cases.",covid
"Aims: To predict potential drugs for COVID-19 by using molecular docking for virtual screening of drugs approved for other clinical applications. Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. It was listed as a potential global health threat by WHO due to high mortality, high basic reproduction number and lack of clinically approved drugs and vaccines for COVID-19. The genomic sequence of the virus responsible for COVID-19, as well as the experimentally determined three dimensional structure of the Main protease are available. Objective: To identify potential drugs that can be repurposed for treatment of COVID-19 by using molecular docking based virtual screening of all approved drugs. Methods: List of drugs approved for clinical use was obtained from SuperDRUG2 database. The structure of the target in the apo form, as well as structures of several target-ligand complexes, were obtained from RCSB PDB. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro determined from X-ray diffraction data was used as the target. Data regarding drugs in clinical trials for COVID-19 was obtained from clinicaltrials.org. Input for molecular docking based virtual screening was prepared by using Obabel and customized python, bash and awk scripts. Molecular docking calculations were carried out with Vina and SMINA, and the docked conformations were analyzed and visualized with PLIP, Pymol and Rasmol. Results: Among the drugs that are being tested in clinical trials for COVID-19, Danoprevir and Darunavir have the highest binding affinity for the target main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Saquinavir and Beclabuvir were identified as the best novel candidates for COVID-19 therapy by using Virtual Screening of drugs approved for other clinical indications. Conclusion: Protease inhibitors approved for treatment of other viral diseases have the potential to be repurposed for treatment of COVID-19.",covid
"Background: The success of battle against COVID-19 depends on public adherence towards infection control measures, which is greatly affected by their knowledge, perception, and practices towards this infection. Aim: To assess the knowledge, perception, and practice towards COVID-19 among the general public of India. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional, online survey was performed among Indian residents who were aged above 15 years. A pre-validated online questionnaire on COVID-19 was distributed through various messenger groups and social media in the author's network. The questionnaire comprised of four sections to collect data regarding demographics, knowledge, perception, and practices towards COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to correlate demographics with knowledge, perception and practice scores about COVID-19. Results: A total of 2459 participants (Males = 1424; Females = 1035) completed the survey tool. The mean age of the study participants was 24.5 ± 7.2. The main sources for COVID-19 information were television (74.5%) and social media (71.0%). Majority of the respondents shown a correct rate of knowledge (74.7%), perception (57.6%), and practices (88.1%) towards COVID-19. Respondents aged more than 40 years; higher education level, living in urban areas, and pursuing healthcare profession were positively associated with high knowledge, perception, and practices scores towards COVID-19. Conclusion: The study concludes, majority of the respondents shown a good knowledge and right practices towards COVID-19 pandemic, still there was a gap in right perception towards underlying myths and facts about COVID-19. Providing educational programs and circulating WHO myth busters through media or social networks can resolve underlying misconceptions about COVID-19 and improves the knowledge, perception, and practices among public.",covid
"No vaccine against infection by SARS-CoV-2 yet exists. Treatment by hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) medication, among others, has been proposed. However, prophylactic HCQ medication has been little evaluated. We propose to use data from patients with rheumatic diseases (RA, SLR) who have been chronically taking HCQ medication since before the COVID-19 outbreak (hereafter: HCQpa), in order to evaluate the potential of HCQ for preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2. This can be achieved with relative ease by considering whether COVID-19 prevalence is significantly lower in HCQpa than in the general population (i.e., all people that are not HCQpa). Even if COVID-19 prevalence is truly significantly lower in HCQpa, some HCQpa may still present with COVID-19 (lower prevalence does not mean a prevalence of zero). However, given a value for COVID-19 prevalence in the general population and a number of available HCQpa, one may compute the maximum number of HCQpa for that total number of HCQpa considered that can have COVID-19 in order to still be able to conclude a lower COVID-19 prevalence in HCQpa (i.e., if there is one more case of COVID-19 than that maximum number, the COVID-19 prevalence in the HCQpa cannot be said to be lower than in the general population). Because the COVID-19 prevalence in the general population is not known with precision, we will consider different general population prevalence values. Among these contemplated prevalence values, one is derived from the official total number of confirmed cases, others by computing the total number of cases from the number of fatal COVID-19 cases so far and considering different case fatality rates per total cases. Our analyses show that systematic testing for COVID-19 in as few as 5,000 HCQpa is all that is needed for a test of whether HCQ has a prophylactic action against COVID-19, even for a COVID-19 prevalence value as low as 250 per 100,000, provided that test sensitivity is at least equal to its specificity. For higher COVID-19 prevalence values, the number of HCQpa needed is even lower.",covid
"COVID-19 pandemic is the global health crisis of our time. A recent study has found that the virus can remain viable in air for multiple hours, thus the spread of virus can be affected by wind conditions such as wind speed and direction. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the impact of wind conditions on COVID-19 pandemic in Jakarta, Indonesia. The wind parameters were evaluated using wind roses analysis to estimate the direction of spread of virus. The effect of meteorological factors such as wind speed, temperature, sunshine hours, rainfall and humidity on COVID-19 cases was examined using Spearman correlation test. Result of study reveals that a low wind speed is significantly correlated with a higher COVID-19 cases (r = -0.314; p < 0.05). Similarly, low temperatures and sunshine hours are correlated with a higher COVID-19 cases (r = -0.447; p < 0.01, r = -0.362; p < 0.05, respectively). However, there are not significant linear correlations between humidity and rainfall with COVID-19 cases (p > 0.05). In addition, wind rose diagrams indicate that the highest COVID-19 cases fits in with wind direction blows. In study area, the dominant wind direction blows to the Southeast and East parts of the area with wind speed value is low in range from 3.60 to 5.70 m/s. In conclusion, low wind speed is a contributor to increase COVID-19 cases.",covid
"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already evolved into a rapidly expanding pandemic. Risk factors for COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes, are all strongly associated with smoking habits. The effects of cigarette smoking on the transmission of the virus and worsening of COVID-19 have been less addressed. Emerging data indicate that smoking history is the major determinant of worsening COVID-19 outcomes. Smoking cessation recovers airway ciliary clearance and immune function. Thus, smoking cessation awareness is strongly encouraged as a public health measure to limit the global impact of COVID-19.",covid
"The arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic in Pakistan necessitated that the Centre of Biomedical Ethics and Culture in Karachi realign its activities to changing realities in the country. As Pakistan's only bioethics center, and with no guidelines available for allocation of scarce medical resources, CBEC developed ""Guidelines for Ethical Healthcare Decision-Making in Pakistan"" with input from medical and civil society stakeholders. The CBEC blog connected to the center's bioethics programs for students from Pakistan and Kenya shifted to Covid-related issues specific to the context of existing social and political realities within these countries. As part of its outreach activities, CBEC initiated a popular Facebook series, #HumansofCovid, as an experience-sharing platform for health care professionals and members of the public. Narratives received vary from those by frustrated physicians under quarantine to those concerning street vendors left jobless and a transsexual person in whose opinion ""social distancing"" is not a new phenomenon for their communities.",covid
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious pathogen causing the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the ongoing unprecedented pandemic in 2020. SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory systems, so acute respiratory distress syndrome is the major cause of death. Clinical courses of COVID-19 are variable and unpredictable, while some epidemiologic and clinical factors have been found to have a negative impact on the disease prognosis. Despite a growing report on clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with COVID-19, the data in the special population, including transplant recipients, is still limited. Herein we report on the clinical features and fatal outcome of COVID-19 in a dual pancreas-kidney transplant recipient (with failure of the pancreas graft). Our case illustrates the similarities and differences of the COVID-19 disease course between transplant recipients and the general population. We proposed that the pre-existing T-cell dysfunction from the long-term use of immunosuppressive agents in organ transplant recipients adversely affects COVID-19 prognosis and worsens COVID-19 mortality.",covid
"Purpose: CT signs that are evocative of lung COVID-19 infections have been extensively described, whereas 18F-FDG-PET signs have not. Our current study aimed to identify specific COVID-19 18F-FDG-PET signs in patients that were (i) suspected to have a lung infection based on 18F-FDG-PET/CT recorded during the COVID-19 outbreak and (ii) whose COVID-19 diagnosis was definitely established or excluded by appropriate viral testing. Methods: Twenty-two consecutive patients referred for routine 18F-FDG-PET/CT examinations during the COVID-19 outbreak (March 25th to May 15th 2020) and for whom CT slices were evocative of a lung infection were included in the study. All patients had undergone a SARS-COV-2 diagnostic test to confirm COVID-19 infection (positivity was based on molecular and/or serological tests) or exclude it (negativity of at least the serological test). Results: Eleven patients were confirmed to be affected by COVID-19 (COVID+), whereas the other eleven patients were not (COVID-) and were predominantly suspected of having bacterial pneumonia. CT abnormalities were not significantly different between COVID+ and COVID- groups, although trends toward larger CT abnormalities (p = 0.16) and lower rates of consolidation patterns (0.09) were observed in the COVID+ group. The maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of lung areas with CT abnormalities were however significantly lower in the COVID+ than the COVID- group (3.7 ± 1.9 vs. 6.9 ± 4.1, p = 0.03), with the highest SUVmax consistently not associated with COVID-19. Conclusion: Among CT abnormalities evocative of lung infection, those related to COVID-19 are associated with a more limited 18F-FDG uptake. This observation may help improve our ability to detect COVID-19 patients.",covid
"Aim: To validate the British Society of Thoracic Imaging issued guidelines for the categorisation of chest radiographs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reporting regarding reproducibility amongst radiologists and diagnostic performance. Materials and methods: Chest radiographs from 50 patients with COVID-19, and 50 control patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 from prior to the emergence of the novel coronavirus were assessed by seven consultant radiologists with regards to the British Society of Thoracic Imaging guidelines. Results: The findings show excellent specificity (100%) and moderate sensitivity (44%) for guideline-defined Classic/Probable COVID-19, and substantial interobserver agreement (Fleiss' k=0.61). Fair agreement was observed for the ""Indeterminate for COVID-19"" (k=0.23), and ""Non-COVID-19"" (k=0.37) categories; furthermore, the sensitivity (0.26 and 0.14 respectively) and specificity (0.76, 0.80) of these categories for COVID-19 were not significantly different (McNemar's test p=0.18 and p=0.67). Conclusion: An amalgamation of the categories of ""Indeterminate for COVID-19"" and ""Non-COVID-19"" into a single ""not classic of COVID-19"" classification would improve interobserver agreement, encompass patients with a similar probability of COVID-19, and remove the possibility of labelling patients with COVID-19 as ""Non-COVID-19"", which is the presenting radiographic appearance in a significant minority (14%) of patients.",covid
"The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the biomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset. We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. We also designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms and clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications. We believe that our work is complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset, code, and DL models are publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/COVID-19-CT-CXR.",covid
"Covid-19 is a highly contagious virus which almost freezes the world along with its economy. Its ability of human-to-human and surface-to-human transmission turns the world into catastrophic phase. In this study, our aim is to predict the future conditions of novel Coronavirus to recede its impact. We have proposed deep learning based comparative analysis of Covid-19 cases in India and USA. The datasets of confirmed and death cases of Covid-19 are taken into consideration. The recurrent neural network (RNN) based variants of long short term memory (LSTM) such as Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM and Convolutional LSTM are used to design the proposed methodology and forecast the Covid-19 cases for one month ahead. Convolution LSTM outperformed the other two models and predicts the Covid-19 cases with high accuracy and very less error for all four datasets of both countries. Upward/downward trend of forecasted Covid-19 cases are also visualized graphically, which would be helpful for researchers and policy makers to mitigate the mortality and morbidity rate by streaming the Covid-19 into right direction.",covid
"U.S. long-haul truck drivers traverse great distances and interact with numerous individuals, rendering them vulnerable to acquiring and transmitting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Together, the unique co-occurrence of pronounced health disparities and known COVID-19 infection, morbidity, and mortality risks suggest the possibility of a novel COVID-19 based truck driver syndemic due to advanced driver age and endemic health issues. In turn, COVID-19 sequelae may perpetuate existing health disparities. The co-occurrence of afflictions may also result in compromised safety performance. To curb the likelihood of a COVID-19 based truck driver syndemic, several action stepsare needed. First, key COVID-19 metrics need to be established for this population. Second, relationships between long-haul trucker network attributes and COVID-19 spread need to bedelineated. Third, mutually reinforcing interactions between endemic health disparities and COVID-19 vulnerability need to be elucidated. Finally, grounded in the aforementioned steps, policies and interventions need to be identified and implemented.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world rapidly infecting millions of people. An efficient tool that can accurately recognize important clinical concepts of COVID-19 from free text in electronic health records will be significantly valuable to accelerate various applications of COVID-19 research. To this end, the existing clinical NLP tool CLAMP was quickly adapted to COVID-19 information and generated an automated tool called COVID-19 SignSym, which can extract and signs/symptoms and their eight attributes such as temporal information and negations from clinical text. The extracted information is also mapped to standard clinical concepts in the common data model of OHDSI OMOP. Evaluation on clinical notes and medical dialogues demonstrated promising results. It is freely accessible to the community as a downloadable package of APIs (https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/nlp.php). We believe COVID-19 SignSym will provide fundamental supports to the secondary use of EHRs, thus accelerating the global research of COVID-19.",covid

"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has had major implications for the United States health care system. This survey study sought to identify practice changes, to understand current personal protective equipment (PPE) use, and to determine how caring for patients with COVID-19 differs for vascular surgeons practicing in states with high COVID-19 case numbers vs in states with low case numbers. Methods: A 14-question online survey regarding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgeons' current practice was sent to 365 vascular surgeons across the country through REDCap from April 14 to April 21, 2020, with responses closed on April 23, 2020. The survey response was analyzed with descriptive statistics. Further analyses were performed to evaluate whether responses from states with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and California) differed from those with lower case numbers (all other states). Results: A total of 121 vascular surgeons responded (30.6%) to the survey. All high-volume states were represented. The majority of vascular surgeons are reusing PPE. The majority of respondents worked in an academic setting (81.5%) and were performing only urgent and emergent cases (80.5%) during preparation for the surge. This did not differ between states with high and low COVID-19 case volumes (P = .285). States with high case volume were less likely to perform a lower extremity intervention for critical limb ischemia (60.8% vs 77.5%; P = .046), but otherwise case types did not differ. Most attending vascular surgeons worked with residents (90.8%) and limited their exposure to procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases (56.0%). Thirty-eight percent of attending vascular surgeons have been redeployed within the hospital to a vascular access service or other service outside of vascular surgery. This was more frequent in states with high case volume compared with low case volume (P = .039). The majority of vascular surgeons are reusing PPE (71.4%) and N95 masks (86.4%), and 21% of vascular surgeons think that they do not have adequate PPE to perform their clinical duties. Conclusions: The initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in reduced elective cases, with primarily only urgent and emergent cases being performed. A minority of vascular surgeons have been redeployed outside of their specialty; however, this is more common among states with high case numbers. Adequate PPE remains an issue for almost a quarter of vascular surgeons who responded to this survey.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic. Evidence suggests a strong association between COVID-19 and pro-thrombotic states. We report our experience in managing a patient with COVID-19 complicated by a right atrial thrombus. We highlight the successful use of half-dose anticoagulation in the treatment of right atrial thrombus in a patient with COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is a first reported case of right atrial thrombus in a COVID-19 patient who was treated successfully with half-dose anticoagulation.",covid
"A rapid cross-sectional survey was conducted across India among frontline allopathic doctors to know their prime concerns. Four hundred and five responses were received from 16 states and 3 union territories. Among doctors working in COVID-dedicated hospitals, 56.18% are formally trained for the same, and 40.5% of these are satisfied with the training. 47.3% of these have personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, 35.1% have no PPE kits, and 17.6% are not aware of their availability. 31.1% of doctors reported attending to COVID suspects without PPE. 58.1% of institutions have a dedicated task force, 20.3% do not, whereas 21.6% of doctors are not aware of such a task force. Only 21.6% of the participants consider their institution to be fully prepared for COVID. After performing COVID duties, 45.9% are being provided with an alternative place of stay, whereas only 16.2% have been quarantined. In non-COVID institutions, 82.4% of doctors are using protective gear, of these 35.2% procured them on their own.",covid
"The rapid spread of COVID-19 global outbreak will inevitably pose great challenges for public health and medical care, especially for major concerns of public health such as HIV. In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNAIDS is urging countries to remain steadfast in their HIV prevention efforts. Few studies of COVID-19 have been focused on marginalized populations, especially those with HIV infection. This study aims to review the studies and researches of COVID-19 among people living with HIV, covering the impacts of COVID-19 on their disease progression, HIV-related medical services, HIV epidemics, and measures on relieving the above-mentioned impacts, which might provide references for targeted scientific research and prevention practice of COVID-19 in HIV population, and optimizing prevention and treatment services in the context of this pandemic.",covid
"Background: This study aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of low serum calcium and phosphorus in discriminative diagnosis of the severity of COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a single-center hospital-based study and consecutively recruited 122 suspected and 104 confirmed COVID-19 patients during January 24 to April 25, 2020. The clinical risk factors of COVID-19 were identified. The discriminative power of low calcium and phosphorus regarding the disease severity was evaluated. Results: Low calcium and low phosphorus are more prevalent in severe/critical COVID-19 patients than moderate COVID-19 patients (OR 15.07, 95%CI 1.59 -143.18 for calcium, OR 6.90, 95%CI 2.43 - 19.64 for phosphorus). The specificity in detecting the severe/critical patients among COVID-19 patients reached 98.5% (95%CI 92.0-99.7%) and 84.4% (95%CI 74.3-91.6%) by low calcium and low phosphorus, respectively, albeit with suboptimal sensitivity. Calcium and phosphorus combined with lymphocyte count could obtain the best discriminative performance for the severe COVID-19 patients (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.80), and combined with oxygenation index was promising (AUC = 0.71). Similar discriminative performances of low calcium and low phosphorus were found between suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Low calcium and low phosphorus could indicate the severity of COVID-19 patients, and may be utilized as a promising clinical biomarker for discriminative diagnosis.

"Objectives: COVID-19 has caused a large global pandemic. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited considerable variation in disease behavior. Pervious genome-wide association studies have identified potential genetic variants involved in the risk and prognosis of COVID-19, but the underlying biological interpretation remains largely unclear. Methods: We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method to identify genes that were pleiotropically associated with the risk and various outcomes of COVID-19, including severe respiratory confirmed COVID-19 and hospitalized COVID-19. Results: In blood, we identified 2 probes, ILMN_1765146 and ILMN_1791057 tagging IFNAR2, that showed pleiotropic association with hospitalized COVID-19 (Beta; [SE]=0.42 [0.09], P=4.75E-06 and Beta; [SE]=-0.48 [0.11], P=6.76E-06, respectively). Although no other probes were significant after correction for multiple testing in both blood and lung, multiple genes as tagged by the top 5 probes were involved in inflammation or antiviral immunity, and several other tagged genes, such as PON2 and HPS5, were involved in blood coagulation. Conclusions: We identified IFNAR2 and other potential genes that could be involved in the susceptibility or prognosis of COVID-19. These findings provide important leads to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cytokine storm and venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 and potential therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of COVID-19.",covid
"Severe COVID-19 may predispose to both venous and arterial thrombosis. We describe a patient with acute ischaemic stroke while suffering from COVID-19 and respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical ventilation. Deep sedation may delay diagnosis. Learning points: A thrombotic stroke can complicate severe COVID-19.Prolonged deep sedation during mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients may delay the diagnosis of stroke.The hypercoagulability and a thrombo-inflammatory response in COVID-19 is characterized by an increase in D-dimers and fibrinogen.",covid
"Current development around the pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents a significant healthcare resource burden threatening to overwhelm the available nationwide healthcare infrastructure. It is essential to consider, especially for resource-limited nations, strategizing the coordinated response to handle this crisis effectively and preparing for the upcoming emergence of calamity caused by this yet-to-know disease entity. Relevant epidemiological data were retrieved from currently available online reports related to COVID-19 patients. The correlation coefficient was calculated by plotting dependant variables - the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths due to COVID 19 on the Y-axis and independent variables - critical-care beds per capita, the median age of the population of the country, the number of COVID-19 tests per million population, population density (persons per square km), urban population percentage, and gross domestic product (GDP) expense on health care - on the X-axis. After analyzing the data, both the fatality rate and the total number of COVID-19 cases were found to have an inverse association with the population density with the variable - the number of cases of COVID-19 - achieving a statistical significance (p-value 0.01). The negative correlation between critical care beds and the fatality rate is well-justified, as intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators are the critical elements in the management of complicated cases. There was also a significant positive correlation between GDP expenses on healthcare by a country and the number of COVID-19 cases being registered (p-value 0.008), although that did not affect mortality (p-value 0.851). This analysis discusses the overview of various epidemiological determinants possibly contributing to the variation in patient outcomes across regions and helps improve our understanding to develop a plan of action and effective control measures in the future.",covid
"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a 2020 pandemic, has resulted in an unexpected loss in lives, quality of life, and the economy. The COVID-19 clinical spectrum varies from asymptomatic to death, and its complications may involve various organs. Notwithstanding, the impact of COVID-19 on endocrine systems is understudied. Previous coronavirus outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus can cause new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM). However, there were only two previous case reports on newly diagnosed DM in COVID-19 patients. Here, we described three patients who had newly diagnosed DM associated with COVID-19. COVID-19 likely unmasked existing DM by aggravating its metabolic complications rather than causing the new-onset DM in these patients. However, more research is needed to evaluate if there is a casual relationship between the development of DM, DKA, and COVID-19.",covid
"Disclaimer: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. Purpose: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with thrombotic complications such as stroke and venous thromboembolism (VTE), and VTE prophylaxis for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is recommended. However, extended postdischarge VTE prophylaxis and VTE prophylaxis for nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 are not routinely recommended due to uncertain benefit in these populations. Summary: Here we report development of a pulmonary embolism (PE) in a young patient without other VTE risk factors who was treated for COVID-19 in an emergency department (ED) and discharged home without VTE prophylaxis, which was consistent with current recommendations. The patient presented to the ED 12 days later with complaints of chest pain for 1 day and was found to have a PE within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the left lower lobe. Conclusion: This case suggests that nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 may be at higher risk for VTE than patients with other medical illnesses and warrants further research into the risk of VTE in outpatients with COVID-19.",covid
"The Moderating Roles of Psychological Flexibility and Inflexibility on the Mental Health Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown in Italy. Preliminary data suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on mental health in approximately a quarter of the general population. Few prior studies have identified contextual risk factors and no published study has explored factors that might moderate their adverse effects on mental health. Psychological flexibility is the cornerstone of psychological health and resiliency. This study investigated the roles of psychological flexibility and inflexibility in moderating the effects of COVID-19 risk factors on three mental health outcomes: COVID-19 peritraumatic distress, anxiety, depression. We hypothesized that psychological flexibility would mitigate and psychological inflexibility would exacerbate the adverse effects of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. During the Italian national lockdown (M = 39.29 days, SD = 11.26), 1035 adults (79% female, M = 37.5 years, SD = 12.3) completed an online survey. Twelve COVID-19 risk factors were identified (e.g. lockdown duration, family infected by COVID-19, increase in domestic violence and in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours) and constituted a COVID-19 Lockdown Index. As predicted, results showed that after controlling for sociodemographic variables, global psychological flexibility and four of its sub-processes (self-as context, defusion, values, committed action), mitigated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. In contrast and as expected, global psychological inflexibility and four of its sub-processes (lack of contact with present moment, fusion, self-as-content, lack of contact with personal values) exacerbated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. Findings converge with those from the broader psychological flexibility literature providing robust support for the use of ACT-based interventions to promote psychological flexibility and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Introduction: Renalase (RNLS), a novel secreted plasma flavoprotein, has anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of disease processes. Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with disordered inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that reduced plasma RNLS levels could be a marker of COVID-19 disease severity. Methods: Plasma was collected from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 15 uninfected non-hospitalized controls. Plasma RNLS and cytokine levels were measured and sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from chart review. Data were analyzed using nonparametric analyses and Kaplan Meir curve log rank analysis. Results: Plasma RNLs levels were negatively correlated with inflammatory markers, including IL-1b, IL-6, and TNFa (p = 0.04, p = 0.03, p = 0.01, respectively). Patients with COVID-19 disease had lower levels of RNLS than controls. Lower levels of RNLS were associated with more severe disease among COVID-19 patients. Low RNLS was also associated with worse survival among COVID-19 patients (HR = 4.54; 95% CI: 1.06-19.43; p = 0.005). Conclusion: Low plasma RNLS levels are associated with severe COVID-19 disease and may be a useful additional biomarker when identifying patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Given RNLS anti-inflammatory properties and negative correlation with inflammatory markers, these findings also suggest evidence of a potential pathophysiological mechanism for severe COVID-19 disease.",covid
"Background and objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected 586,000 patients in the U.S. However, the COVDI-19 daily incidence and deaths in the U.S. are poorly understood. Internet search interest was found highly correlated with COVID-19 daily incidence in China, but not yet applied to the U.S. Therefore, we examined the association of search interest with COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths in the U.S. Methods: We extracted the COVDI-19 daily incidence and death data in the U.S. from two population-based datasets. The search interest of COVID-19 related terms was obtained using Google Trends. Pearson correlation test and general linear model were used to examine correlations and predict future trends, respectively. Results: There were 555,245 new cases and 22,019 deaths of COVID-19 reported in the U.S. from March 1 to April 12, 2020. The search interest of COVID, COVID pneumonia, and COVID heart were correlated with COVDI-19 daily incidence with about 12-day of delay (Pearson r=0.978, 0.978 and 0.979, respectively) and deaths with 19-day of delay (Pearson r=0.963, 0.958 and 0.970, respectively). The COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths appeared to both peak on April 10. The 4-day follow-up with prospectively collected data showed moderate to good accuracies for predicting new cases (Pearson r=-0.641 to -0.833) and poor to good acuracies for daily new deaths (Pearson r=0.365 to 0.935). Conclusions: Search terms related to COVID-19 are highly correlated with the trends in COVID-19 daily incidence and deaths in the U.S. The prediction-models based on the search interest trend reached moderate to good accuracies.",covid
"A prominent feature of anxiety in late life is concerns regarding physical health. Anxiety symptoms among older adults have been connected with various psychological outcomes, including social isolation and loneliness. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many societies have demonstrated increased ageist attitudes, encouraging older adults to distance themselves from society. Accordingly, the current study examined the moderating role of COVID-19-related ageism in the connection between COVID-19 health worries and anxiety symptoms among older adults. Data were collected from 243 older adults (age range 60-92; M = 69.75, SD = 6.69), who completed scales assessing COVID-19-related health worries and ageism, as well as anxiety symptoms. The results demonstrated that both health worries and ageism were positively associated with anxiety symptoms. Moreover, the connection between health worries and anxiety symptoms was more pronounced among older adults with high ageism levels. The study highlights the vulnerability of older adults in general, and ageist older adults in particular, to the negative consequences of COVID-19-related health worries, and emphasizes the role of the increased ageist stance of society during the pandemic in this regard.",covid
"Introduction: On 21 February 2020, 'Luigi Sacco' Hospital was identified as a Covid-19 referral Hospital in Lombardy. The Department of Urology of our Healthcare Institution consists of two Urology Units, one at 'L.Sacco' Hospital (hereinafter referred to as Covid-19 hospital) and one at 'Fatebenefratelli' Hospital (hereinafter referred to as Covid-19-free hospital). The Healthcare System's Administration communicated to all personnel the implementation of a planned 'biological risk protocol' at the Covid-19 hospital, while the Covid-19-free hospital followed regular government recommendations. We evaluated the risk of Sars-Cov-2 infection in the patients treated for surgical or invasive urologic procedures during the epidemic in the two different hospitals. Materials and methods: At the Covid-19 hospital, 12 patients underwent surgery and 51 patients invasive diagnostic procedures between 22 February and 8 March 2020; in the same period, at the Covid-19-free hospital, 21 patients underwent surgery and 56 patients invasive diagnostic procedures. We compared the incidence of Sars-Cov-2 infection among the patients who were accessed in the two Urology Units in the period of different restrictive measures after the outbreak of the epidemic. Results: We registered no cases of Sars-Cov-2 infection in the patients hospitalized in that period in Covid-19 hospital, despite three cases of swab positivity in the Covid-19-free hospital. Conclusion: The early implementation of extraordinary measures to restrict the spread of the virus offers a good protection also in a Covid-19 referral Hospital. The adoption of safety measures may be considered even after the end of the pandemic in all the health systems.",covid
"Only recently histopathological studies of patients with dermatosis and concomitant SARS-Cov-2 viral infection were published. Seven months into the COVID-19 pandemic, more skin biopsies of COVID-19 positive patients are taking place. We examined the histological features of 30 skin biopsies from two groups of patients: Ten specimens of patients tested positive for COVID-19 with an active systemic infection and associated dermatosis. Twenty specimens were from patients not considered COVID-positive (due to PCR swab negativity or not tested at all) with cutaneous lesions either showing viral infection symptoms (fever, cough, ageusia and severe immunocompromised condition due to HIV infection and malignancies), or presented a high risk of being infected (such as cohabitation with COVID-19 positive parents and siblings with simultaneous chilblains). This study analyses the histological and immunohistochemical (SARS-CoV-2 2019-nCoV nucleocapsid antibody) characteristics of the two groups and identifies 4 histopathological patterns. The histopathological features of the two groups present similar features that may help to identify an ongoing COVID-19 infection even in asymptomatic carriers with dermatosis.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease, which is currently causing a devastating pandemic resulting in more than millions of infected cases worldwide. Emerging evidence reports the impact of several co-morbidities on the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19. However, the evidence regarding the association of mental health illnesses and psychiatric treatment on the prognoses of COVID-19 is still lacking. Lithium is a commonly prescribed psychiatric medication that is also well known for its highly lethal toxicity. Many factors can fluctuate the level of lithium, such as drug interaction, illness, and infection. Prompt recognition and management of lithium intoxication is required to reduce patients' morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is no report regarding COVID-19 and lithium toxicity. Herein, we are presenting two patients with COVID-19 who initially presented with signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity. Our cases emphasize the need for special attention in taking care of patients who are taking lithium during the COVID-19 pandemic. In general, we recommend obtaining lithium levels in all patients who have been taking lithium and have the diagnosis of COVID-19.",covid

COVID-19 does not seem to cross the blood-brain barrier. The exact mechanisms of encephalopathy and pathological response of COVID-19 are unknown.",covid
"Emerging epidemiological data suggest that white Americans have a lower risk of acquiring COVID-19. Although many studies have pointed to the role of systemic racism in COVID-19 racial/ethnic disparities, few studies have examined the contribution of racial segregation. Residential segregation is associated with differing health outcomes by race/ethnicity for various diseases, including HIV. This commentary documents differing HIV and COVID-19 outcomes and service delivery by race/ethnicity and the crucial role of racial segregation. Using publicly available Census data, we divide US counties into quintiles by percentage of non-Hispanic white residents and examine HIV diagnoses and COVID-19 per 100,000 population. HIV diagnoses decrease as the proportion of white residents increase across US counties. COVID-19 diagnoses follow a similar pattern: Counties with the highest proportion of white residents have the fewest cases of COVID-19 irrespective of geographic region or state political party inclination (i.e., red or blue states). Moreover, comparatively fewer COVID-19 diagnoses have occurred in primarily white counties throughout the duration of the US COVID-19 pandemic. Systemic drivers place racial minorities at greater risk for COVID-19 and HIV. Individual-level characteristics (e.g., underlying health conditions for COVID-19 or risk behavior for HIV) do not fully explain excess disease burden in racial minority communities. Corresponding interventions must use structural- and policy-level solutions to address racial and ethnic health disparities.",covid
"Following its initial appearance in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly spread around the globe. Here, we evaluated the role of climate (temperature and precipitation), region-specific COVID-19 susceptibility (BCG vaccination factors, malaria incidence, and percentage of the population aged over 65 years), and human mobility (relative amounts of international visitors) in shaping the geographical patterns of COVID-19 case numbers across 1,020 countries/regions, and examined the sequential shift that occurred from December 2019 to June 30, 2020 in multiple drivers of the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. Our regression model adequately explains the cumulative COVID-19 case numbers (per 1 million population). As the COVID-19 spread progressed, the explanatory power (R2) of the model increased, reaching > 70% in April 2020. Climate, host mobility, and host susceptibility to COVID-19 largely explained the variance among COVID-19 case numbers across locations; the relative importance of host mobility and that of host susceptibility to COVID-19 were both greater than that of climate. Notably, the relative importance of these factors changed over time; the number of days from outbreak onset drove COVID-19 spread in the early stage, then human mobility accelerated the pandemic, and lastly climate (temperature) propelled the phase following disease expansion. Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic is deterministically driven by climate suitability, cross-border human mobility, and region-specific COVID-19 susceptibility. The identification of these multiple drivers of the COVID-19 outbreak trajectory, based on mapping the spread of COVID-19, will contribute to a better understanding of the COVID-19 disease transmission risk and inform long-term preventative measures against this disease.",covid
"Purpose: COVID-19 pandemic is a serious public health concern, and the role of health care workers is essential in preventing spread. The study objective is to investigate awareness, perception, and attitude towards COVID-19 and infection control measures among ophthalmologists in Jordan. Methods: The design of the study was a cross-sectional survey among Jordanian ophthalmologists. An online survey was sent to 197 ophthalmologists on March 23, 2020. Information on participants' socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of clinical features of COVID-19, risk assessment and infection control measures for preventing disease transmission, and attitude towards treating patients with COVID-19 were collected. Results: A total of 132 ophthalmologists (mean age 40.5 years) responded, 23 (17.6%) had received training on infection control in ophthalmology. Most ophthalmologists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways to identify patients at risk of having the disease, correctly reported modes of transmission and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in the ophthalmic setup. Social media was the commonest source of information on COVID-19 (75%), and 38.2% were not provided with instructions on infection control plan to reduce transmission of COVID-19. Most ophthalmologists (79.5%) thought that the virus could be detected in tears, and 72.2% thought that red eye as a symptom of COVID-19. Conclusion: Ophthalmologists in Jordan were aware of the epidemiology of COVID-19 and related infection preventive measures. Knowledge was lacking regarding ocular aspects of the disease. Training on infection prevention needs to be improved. Access to guidelines from international ophthalmological organizations should be promoted and seeking updated literature from peer-reviewed journals needs to be encouraged.",covid
"Introduction: Early international observations report decreased number of acute ischemic stroke admissions and prolonged onset-to-treatment times during COVID-19 pandemic. Aim: Our goal was to assess the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on Hungarian acute ischemic stroke care. Method: We compared demographical and clinical characteristics, rate of intravenous and endovascular therapies and therapeutic time parameters of acute ischemic strokes admitted to a university stroke centre in a COVID-epidemic period (01/03/2020-30/04/2020) and an identical period of 2019. Results: 86 patients were admitted during the COVID-period and 97 in the control period. Demographical and clinical characteristics of these periods were well-balanced. In the COVID-period, the proportion of patients arriving beyond 24 hours after onset increased by 13% (p = 0.046), the rate of endovascular interventions remained unchanged (8%), the rate of intravenous thrombolysis decreased from 26% to 16%, the mean onset-to-treatment time of thrombolysis increased by 20 minutes, while the mean door-to-treatment time increased by only 5 minutes. Behind the shift of arrival time categories, multivariable (year of examination, NIHSS, age) logistic regression shows that the year of examination might play a leading role (p = 0.096). Conclusion: In the COVID-period, admissions for acute ischemic strokes decreased by 11% and the proportion of cases certainly untreatable by reperfusion therapies (arriving beyond 24 hours after onset) increased significantly. While the rate of endovascular interventions remained unchanged, the absolute rate of intravenous thrombolysis decreased by 10% and the mean onset-to-treatment time showed a tendency to increase. In these changes, the COVID-epidemic itself and related out-of-hospital factors might play a leading role. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(34): 1395-1399.",covid
"Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has abruptly and undoubtedly changed the world as we know it at the end of the 2nd decade of the 21st century. COVID-19 is extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early diagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables health care professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test, however, requires specific equipment and has relatively low sensitivity. Computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on the other hand, reveal specific manifestations associated with this disease. Overlap with other lung infections makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19 challenging. Consequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to develop Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive COVID-19 cases. CNNs, however, are prone to lose spatial information between image instances and require large datasets. The paper presents an alternative modeling framework based on Capsule Networks, referred to as the COVID-CAPS, being capable of handling small datasets, which is of significant importance due to sudden and rapid emergence of COVID-19. Our results based on a dataset of X-ray images show that COVID-CAPS has advantage over previous CNN-based models. COVID-CAPS achieved an Accuracy of 95.7%, Sensitivity of 90%, Specificity of 95.8%, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.97, while having far less number of trainable parameters in comparison to its counterparts. To potentially and further improve diagnosis capabilities of the COVID-CAPS, pre-training and transfer learning are utilized based on a new dataset constructed from an external dataset of X-ray images. This is in contrary to existing works on COVID-19 detection where pre-training is performed based on natural images. Pre-training with a dataset of similar nature further improved accuracy to 98.3% and specificity to 98.6%.",covid
"BACKGROUND COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It has spread rapidly through the world, endangering human life. The main target of COVID-19 is the lungs; however, it can involve other organs, including the liver. Patients with severe COVID-19 have an increased incidence of abnormal liver function, and patients with liver disorders are considered to be at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection. The mechanism of liver injury reported in 14% to 53% of COVID-19 patients is poorly recognized and several possibilities need to be considered (cytokine storm, direct viral action, hypoxia). The incidence of underlying liver comorbidities in patients with a COVID-19 infection ranges from 1% to 11%. CASE REPORT This is a report of 2 nosocomial COVID-19 infections and severe COVID-19 pneumonia in 2 patients who were hospitalized during treatment for alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Case 1 and case 2 were a 31-year-old woman and a 40-year-old woman, respectively, with decompensated ALD and symptoms of the COVID-19 infection. Both patients were transferred from another hospital to our hospital after confirmation of COVID-19 during their hospitalization. The course of the infection progressed rapidly in both patients with the development of multiple-organ failure and death over a short period. CONCLUSIONS There are no clear recommendations on the management of ALD in the COVID-19 pandemic. Alcoholic hepatitis may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and a poor outcome. A high percentage of nosocomial COVID-19 infections are observed; therefore, special precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of COVID-19 exposure.",covid
"We identified types of immune cells that contribute to clearing COVID-19 during the acute phase of the infection in mouse model and human. Our results suggest that both innate and adaptive immune responses are essential for controlling COVID-19 infection. Mild infection report of children by COVID-19 comparing adults' infection causes conclusion of higher resistance of immune system of children comparing adults. Our results show innate immune system including phagocytes contribute severely to the elimination of COVID-19 in both mouse model and human. Our results also show the elimination of COVID-19 required the activation of B cells by CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells play an important role in elimination of COVID-19 in primary effection. We measured IgM and IgG in all patients including adults and kids (human) and found IgM and IgG in kids patients are much higher than other adults patients. It causes production of much more natural antibodies in kids' bodies to protect them against COVID-19 that shows reason of mild effection of kids comparing adults. Our observations have important ramifications for the development of novel vaccination and medicine strategies to alleviate COVID-19. The most important result is for producing any vaccine for COVID-19, increasing and producing these factors must be included: (a) Phagocytes (IgM and IgG), (b) T Cells, and (c) White Cells.",covid
"Introduction: Maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients are highly vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Medical staff of dialysis facilities without sufficient biosecurity protection are susceptible once exposed to asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. This study evaluated the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in all MHD patients and medical staff of dialysis facilities in Wuhan, China. Methods: We collected COVID-19 morbidity and mortality data from MHD patients and medical staff from 52 hemodialysis centers in Wuhan. Then, we analyzed the symptoms and signs of patients and staff in our hospital (Tongji Hospital in Wuhan), and chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection and laboratory tests were performed. After aggressive quarantine of the COVID-19 patients, we followed up on the prognosis of them. Results: We analyzed the hemodialysis data from Wuhan and found that 10% of MHD patients and 6.0% of medical staff were suspected of COVID-19. Further detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid showed that 1.7% of MHD patients and 2.9% of medical staff were confirmed as having COVID-19. In our facility, 18.9% (46/244) of patients and 9.5% (6/63) of medical staff were suspected of COVID-19. Among them, 2.9% (7/244) of MHD patients and 4.8% (3/63) of medical staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed as having COVID-19. Interestingly, 87.0% of MHD patients suspected of COVID-19 did not have obvious symptoms, but the CT screening showed features of viral pneumonia. There were no significant differences in symptoms, CT findings, comorbidity and laboratory findings of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic-acid-positive and -negative patients. We followed up these patients and found that 57 patients with COVID-19 died (COVID-19 mortality 8.9%). Two patients from our dialysis center with COVID-19 (mortality 4.3%) died. No new infections occurred in our dialysis center after aggressive quarantine was initiated. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in MHD patients and medical staff in dialysis facilities were both high in Wuhan. Frequent chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection were needed to screen COVID-19 patients in dialysis facilities. Through the lessons of this experience on the aggressive diagnosis and quarantine measures of COVID-19 patients, we hope medical staff avoid more infections in serious epidemic areas.",covid
"Background: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a significant impact on daily practice in cardiovascular medicine. The preparedness of healthcare workers (HCWs) can affect the spread of infection and the maintenance of the healthcare system. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, perception, and level of confidence regarding COVID-19 care among HCWs involved in cardiovascular medicine. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study about COVID-19 was performed between April 22 and May 7, 2020, among 311 HCWs in cardiovascular departments. The demographic information, COVID-19-related knowledge, and perception and level of confidence toward COVID-19 care were assessed. Results: The median age of the participants was 38 years, and 215 (69.8%) were male. There were 134 (43.1%) physicians and 177 (56.9%) non-physician HCWs. The HCWs, especially non-physician HCWs, had insufficient knowledge about infection-prevention measures for COVID-19, such as how to isolate patients with COVID-19, how to use personal protective equipment, and how to prevent infection during aerosol-generating procedures. Most HCWs showed a low level of confidence toward COVID-19 care, and such poor confidence was associated with the lack of knowledge on optimal infection-prevention measures. Conclusions: This survey revealed the lack of knowledge about adequate infection-prevention measures for COVID-19. More attention should be paid to the preparedness of HCWs, and educating and supporting HCWs involved in cardiovascular medicine is an urgent need.",covid
"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique global health challenge further complicating surgical management of COVID-19 positive patients due to a lack of published literature. Case: Within we discuss a 48-year-old Chinese man, presenting with acute gastrointestinal obstruction due to sigmoid colonic mass. The patient was screened and tested positive for COVID 19 due to his employment in Wuhan, China at the COVID-19 pandemic epicenter. The patient was subsequently taken for open sigmoid colonic resection, however the case presented multiple challenges due to the patient's COVID-19 positive status. Discussion: The challenges of surgical management of COVID-19 positive patients exist are four-fold. First the unknown efficacy of pre-surgical risk stratification in COVID-19 positive patients, second the risk of aerosolized COVID-19 transmission during intubation for surgery, third the risk of fecal COVID-19 transmission to surgical staff during large bowel resection, and fourth the post-operative challenges of caring for COVID-19 positive patients. Conclusion: Further research is needed into these topics, as well as the medical management of COVID-19 surgical patients.",covid
"Belize is one of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean with the lowest COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths until recently. The success of a low community spread of the novel coronavirus-19 can be attributed to the government's rapid response in effective community participation through communication, promoting personal hygiene, social distancing, quarantine, and rapid mapping to trace, identify, and test potentially COVID-19 exposed persons. In addition to effective public awareness, legal and spiritual approaches were utilized to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country of Belize. From March 2020 when the first case was confirmed, the methods employed to curb spread were so effective that no new case was reported for over 50 days. In an attempt to reopen the country for business, the success of effectively preventing widespread of the COVID-19 made the government ease some of the strict preventive measures of community spread. Presently, new COVID-19 cases are being reported as a result of illegal border crossing, repatriations of Belizeans abroad, and the apparent lack of adherence to the earlier measures put in place by the government to curb community spread of the COVID-19. The rise in the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths in Belize seem to jeopardize the success story of community spread earlier recorded in the country. This article presents some of the earlier measures put in place by the government of Belize that effectively curbed the community spread of COVID-19 in the country of Belize. Effective community participation is still the most effective means of preventing COVID-19 spread.",covid
"Background and aims: With no approved vaccines for treating COVID-19 as of August 2020, many health systems and governments rely on contact tracing as one of the prevention and containment methods. However, there have been instances when the infected person forgets his/her contact-persons and does not have their contact details. Therefore, this study aimed at analyzing possible opportunities and challenges of integrating emerging technologies into COVID-19 contact tracing. Methods: The study applied literature search from Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE and WHO COVID-19 reports and guidelines analyzed. Results: While the integration of technology-based contact tracing applications to combat COVID-19 and break transmission chains promise to yield better results, these technologies face challenges such as technical limitations, dealing with asymptomatic individuals, lack of supporting ICT infrastructure and electronic health policy, socio-economic inequalities, deactivation of mobile devices' WIFI, GPS services, interoperability and standardization issues, security risks, privacy issues, political and structural responses, ethical and legal risks, consent and voluntariness, abuse of contact tracing apps, and discrimination. Conclusion: Integrating emerging technologies into COVID-19 contact tracing is seen as a viable option that policymakers, health practitioners and IT technocrats need to seriously consider in mitigating the spread of coronavirus. Further research is also required on how best to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the utilisation of emerging technologies in contact tracing while observing the security and privacy of people in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Pandemic coronavirus (COVID-19) is a novel virus that causes severe pneumonia. Elderly people with co-morbidities are at risk of severe disease. Symptoms are generally milder in children. We present an asthmatic 12-year old girl with cough, wheeze, and mild pneumonia due to COVID-19. Reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 on nasopharyngeal sample. Chest radiograph revealed bronchopneumonia. Frequent salbutamol inhalers were administered for treatment. Case was discharged home 2 days following hospitalization. COVID-19 may present with mild pneumonia in children or with an exacerbation of asthma in asthmatic children. Additional observations of clinical presentations of COVID-19 in children are recommended.",covid
"Managing healthcare in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) era should be guided by ethics, epidemiology, equity, and economics, not emotion. Ethical healthcare policies ensure equitable access to care for patients regardless of whether they have COVID-19 or another disease. Because healthcare resources are limited, a cost per Quality Life Year (QALY) approach to COVID-19 policy should also be considered. Policies that focus solely on mitigating COVID-19 are likely to be ethically or financially unsustainable. A cost/QALY approach could target resources to optimally improve QALYs. For example, most COVID-19 deaths occur in long-term care facilities, and this problem is likely better addressed by a focused long-term care reform than by a society-wide non-pharmacological intervention. Likewise, ramping up elective, non-COVID-19 care in low prevalence regions while expanding testing and case tracking in hot spots could reduce excess mortality from non-COVID-19 diseases and decrease adverse financial impacts while controlling the epidemic. Globally, only ∼0.1% of people have had a COVID-19 infection. Thus, ethical healthcare policy must address the needs of the 99.9%.",covid
"Following the first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2), in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it has spread worldwide. An outbreak in Japan occurred on a cruise ship, and this was followed by community-acquired COVID-19. Herein, we report three cases of COVID-19 that presented pneumonia following admission to Kitasato University Hospital. Patients were admitted based on the positive result of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for COVID-19 nucleic acid. All patients were diagnosed as suffering from non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia and were successfully treated with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r). LPV/r could be an option for treating non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia in general and even in elderly patients.",covid
"Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a fatal and fast-spreading viral infection. To date, the number of COVID-19 patients worldwide has crossed over six million with over three hundred and seventy thousand deaths (according to the data from World Health Organization; updated on 2 June 2020). Although COVID-19 can be rapidly diagnosed, efficient clinical treatment of COVID-19 remains unavailable, resulting in high fatality. Some clinical trials have identified vitamin C (VC) as a potent compound pneumonia management. In addition, glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is clinically as an anti-inflammatory medicine against pneumonia-induced inflammatory stress. We hypothesized that the combination of VC and GA is a potential option for treating COVID-19. Methods: The aim of this study was to determine pharmacological targets and molecular mechanisms of VC + GA treatment for COVID-19, using bioinformational network pharmacology. Results: We uncovered optimal targets, biological processes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of VC + GA against COVID-19. Our findings suggested that combinatorial VC and GA treatment for COVID-19 was associated with elevation of immunity and suppression of inflammatory stress, including activation of the T cell receptor signaling pathway, regulation of Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, ErbB signaling pathway and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway. We also identified 17 core targets of VC + GA, which suggest as antimicrobial function. Conclusions: For the first time, our study uncovered the pharmacological mechanism underlying combined VC and GA treatment for COVID-19. These results should benefit efforts to address the most pressing problem currently facing the world.",covid
"Background and aims: As the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic unravels rapidly, there is a glut of confusing and divergent scientific information emanating from differing sources, including the Indian National Task Force for COVID-19. Thus, a web-based survey was conducted to decipher the approach of Indian doctors to the various options for treatment of COVID-19. Methods: A web-based questionnaire among one lakh doctors across India through email and social media was circulated. After data quality and internal validation, 826 responses were included for analysis. Basic demographic and comparative analysis were performed using the Python3.8.2 software (Windows 10 64 bit, USA). Results: Amongst all the states of India most respondents hailed from the top ten affected states. Overall 76.15% of doctors would either prescribe or consider prescribing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as prophylaxis for health-care providers (HCP). Doctors with experience of managing COVID-19 were more likely to advocate use of HCQ as prophylaxis for HCP (χ2 = 4.357, P = 0.037). Intensivists were more likely to advocate HCQ as prophylaxis (χ2 = 14.588, P < 0.001) as well as for management of mild to moderate COVID-19 (χ2 = 3.91, P = 0.048). In COVID-19, 65.8% doctors overwhelmingly preferred using anti-viral agents in severe cases, continuing ACEi/ARB (60.9%), and routinely screening for COVID-19 as a pre-operative strategy (73.85%). Conclusions: Indian doctors are largely following the scientific guidance provided by Indian National Task Force for COVID-19 and would consider prescribing HCQ as prophylaxis for COVID-19. They would also consider using it in mild to moderate COVID-19.",covid
"BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has an impact on all aspects of patient care. Serum ferritin generally represents a biomarker of choice when iron deficiency is suspected. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase-protein exhibiting elevated serum concentrations in various inflammatory diseases. Here we focus on the role of serum ferritin for diagnostic and clinical management of patients with COVID-19 in comparison with other infectious and non-infectious diseases.METHODS: We examined scientific articles listed in PubMed reporting on ferritin in various infectious and non-infectious diseases. We then compared these results with nine current COVID-19 ferritin reports published in 2020.RESULTS: Several non-infectious as well as non-COVID-19 infectious diseases are characterized by a partly dramatic elevation of serum ferritin levels. All COVID-19 studies published between February and May 2020, which documented laboratory serum ferritin, indicate ferritin as a diagnostic biomarker of COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients.CONCLUSIONS: Serum ferritin may be considered both a prognostic and stratifying biomarker that can also contribute to therapeutic decision-making concerning patients with COVID-19. It should be emphasized, however, that most scientific reports refer to cohorts in the Asian region. Further validation in other cohorts is urgently required.",covid
"Objective: Changes in Public Health recommendations may have changed the number of emergency visits and COVID-19 diagnosed cases in an Emergency Department in Madrid. Methods: This retrospective case series study included all consecutive patients in a tertiary and urban ED in Madrid from 1st to 31st March. The sample was divided: NonCOVID-19, Non-investigated COVID-19, Possible COVID-19, Probable COVID-19, Confirmed COVID-19. Differences between public health periods were tested by ANOVA for each cohort, and by ANCOVA including the number of PCR tests (%) as covariate. Results: A total of 7,163 (4,071 Non-COVID-19, 563 Non-investigated COVID-19, 870 Possible, 648 Probable and 1,011 Confirmed COVID-19) cases were included. Public Health measurements applied during each period showed a clear effect on the case proportion for the five cohorts. Conclusions: The variability of case definitions and diagnostic test criteria may have impact on the number of emergency visits and COVID-19 diagnosed cases in Emergency Department.",covid
"Purpose: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 and its associated infection known as COVID-19 have resulted in a global pandemic. Ocular manifestations of COVID-19 are nonspecific and include hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, secretions, and eyelid edema. There is a paucity in the literature regarding COVID-19 related inflammatory syndromes which may also include ocular manifestations. Observations: In pediatric patients, conjunctivitis has been recently reported in association with a multisystem inflammatory condition related to COVID-19 that shares features with Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. We describe the clinical course of an adult patient with symptoms and signs consistent with a Kawasaki-like syndrome. Conclusions and importance: To our knowledge, this report may be the first case of a Kawasaki-like syndrome in an adult with COVID-19 infection.",covid
"The Coronarovirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak strongly affected nursing and was responsible for a high mortality rate. During the pandemic of March-May 2020, 17 French nursing homes organized staff confinement periods with residents 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, to reduce the risk of entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into their facilities, in a context where visits to residents were prohibited. By means of a telephone survey of their directors, we observed that 16 nursing homes (94%) had no cases of COVID-19 among the residents, and that mortality from COVID-19 was very low compared to that recorded at the national level by Santé publique France (p<10-4). Moreover, the number of cases of Covid-19 among the staff of these nursing homes was also lower than that recorded by Santé publique France (p<10-4). These establishments experienced certain difficulties which the directors managed to overcome and the investment of these teams was widely appreciated by the families of the residents and through the press.",covid
"It is increasingly recognised that patients with severe COVID-19 infection have a significant risk of thromboembolic events. We describe a patient who rapidly deteriorated due to severe infection with COVID-19, and developed priapism in the last days of his life. We believe development of priapism may be associated with a prothrombotic state secondary to COVID-19 infection. This case report supports the widely reported increased incidence of thrombosis in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Learning points: Prophylactic doses of anticoagulation may not be sufficient in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, but clinical trials of therapeutic dose anticoagulation are underway.Physicians should be vigilant and have a high suspicion for thrombosis in all patients with COVID-19 infection, even those who are anticoagulated.Presentations of thromboembolism and microemboli may be atypical.",covid
"Objective: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak progressed rapidly from a public health (PH) emergency of international concern (World Health Organization [WHO], 30 January 2020) to a pandemic (WHO, 11 March 2020). The declaration of a national emergency in the United States (13 March 2020) necessitated the addition and modification of terminology related to COVID-19 and development of the disease's case definition. During this period, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and standard development organizations released guidance on data standards for reporting COVID-19 clinical encounters, laboratory results, cause-of-death certifications, and other surveillance processes for COVID-19 PH emergency operations. The CDC COVID-19 Information Management Repository was created to address the need for PH and health-care stakeholders at local and national levels to easily obtain access to comprehensive and up-to-date information management resources. Materials and methods: We introduce the clinical and health-care informatics community to the CDC COVID-19 Information Management Repository: a new, national COVID-19 information management tool. We provide a description of COVID-19 informatics resources, including data requirements for COVID-19 data reporting. Results: We demonstrate the CDC COVID-19 Information Management Repository's categorization and management of critical COVID-19 informatics documentation and standards. We also describe COVID-19 data exchange standards, forms, and specifications. Conclusions: This information will be valuable to clinical and PH informaticians, epidemiologists, data analysts, standards developers and implementers, and information technology managers involved in the development of COVID-19 situational awareness and response reporting and analytics.",covid
"A 52-year-old man with no significant past medical history was found to have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the setting of COVID-19 infection. He presented with hyperglycemia and an anion gap metabolic acidosis, but without a clear infectious precipitant. Inflammatory markers were subsequently checked, and found to be significantly elevated, raising the suspicion for COVID-19 as a possible etiology despite the lack of typical symptoms - a rapid COVID-19 PCR test checked afterwards was found to be positive. The patient's hospital course was uncomplicated, but the case highlights the possibility of COVID-19 serving as an infectious precipitant for DKA, even when a patient is otherwise asymptomatic in terms of having COVID-19.",covid
"Background: COVID-19 presenting as SARI (severe acute respiratory syndrome) mandates the need for ICU (intensive care unit) hospitalization, increasing healthcare burden. This study aims to determine knowledge of healthcare professionals towards management of SARI in COVID-19 suspected cases. Methods: A total of 313 healthcare professionals from the state of Maharashtra, India completed a questionnaire-based survey study adapted from the WHO interim guidance for management of SARI in COVID-19 suspected cases. Convenience sampling method was used and the distribution of responses was presented as frequencies and percentages. Sub-groups were classified on the basis of gender, age, profession and ICU vs. Non-ICU setting. Descriptive statistics were performed for all groups based on percentage of correct responses and individual pairwise comparisons were done using the Chi-Square test. Results: The median and mean percentage of correct responses for all sub groups was only 66.80% and 58.62% respectively. A higher percentage of total correct responses were those from the ICU setting with a higher overall performance from medical postgraduates. The nursing and allied healthcare professionals had a poor overall performance. Conclusions: The findings indicate lacunae in several aspects of SARI management which calls for nationwide studies and implementation of comprehensive training programmes. A uniform structured training program with team-oriented crisis resource management suitable for all healthcare professionals irrespective of prior training in COVID-19 management must be implemented. Furthermore, the findings of this study can serve as a baseline to develop training resources for healthcare professionals for COVID-19 management.",covid
"The paper aims to critically review past and emerging literature to help professionals and researchers alike to better understand, manage and valorize both the tourism impacts and transformational affordance of COVID-19. To achieve this, first, the paper discusses why and how the COVID-19 can be a transformational opportunity by discussing the circumstances and the questions raised by the pandemic. By doing this, the paper identifies the fundamental values, institutions and pre-assumptions that the tourism industry and academia should challenge and break through to advance and reset the research and practice frontiers. The paper continues by discussing the major impacts, behaviours and experiences that three major tourism stakeholders (namely tourism demand, supply and destination management organisations and policy makers) are experiencing during three COVID-19 stages (response, recovery and reset). This provides an overview of the type and scale of the COVID-19 tourism impacts and implications for tourism research.",covid
"Despite rapidly evolving knowledge about COVID 19 infection, routes of perinatal COVID 19 transmission and viral load in mother neonate dyad remain uncertain. Data were analysed to describe the clinicodemographic profile and viral load in neonates born to COVID 19 positive mothers. Of 2947 deliveries, 69 mothers were COVID 19 positive (2.3%), with 1 abortion, 2 macerated stillbirths and 2 fresh stillbirths as pregnancy outcomes. Of 65 tested neonates, 10.7% (7) were confirmed COVID 19 positive by RTPCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction). Viral load (cycle threshold, Ct of E, RDRp) in neonates was comparable with the Ct reported from adults; however, neonates had milder clinical manifestations. All 7 neonates who tested positive for COVID 19 were subsequently discharged. Six of the 7 neonates were asymptomatic and 1 neonate needed respiratory support (indication being prematurity) which resolved after 48 h. Maternal and neonatal comparison of Ct of E and RdRp gene was statistically non-significant (25.97 vs 19.68, p = 0.34 and 26.5 vs 25.0, p = 0.84). Viral loads of mothers with COVID 19 positive neonates compared with mothers with COVID 19 negative neonates for E and RdRp gene were also statistically non-significant (25 vs 27.19, p = 0.63 and 19.6 vs 27.6, p = 0.08). The majority (93%) of neonates tested later than 48 h (roomed in with mother and breastfed) tested negative.Conclusion: The study supports milder manifestation in COVID 19 positive neonates. Risk of transmission from COVID 19 positive mother to neonate by rooming-in and breastfeeding is low. In this study on a limited number of neonates, maternal viral load was not found to be associated with the positivity status or severity of the illness of neonate. What is Known: • Neonates born to COVID 19 positive mothers are at risk of COVID 19 infection. What is New: • Risk of transmission of COVID 19 from mother to neonate, with rooming-in and breastfeeding, appears low. • In this study on a limited number of neonates, maternal viral load of COVID 19 (E and RdRp cycle thresholds) was not associated with severity of illness or COVID 19 positivity in neonates.",covid
"The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to affect a growing number of populations in different parts of the world. In the current situation, drug repurposing is a viable strategy to combat COVID-19. The drugs targeting the host receptors that interact with SARS-CoV-2 are possible candidates. However, assessment of their effectiveness in COVID-19 patients is necessary before prioritizing them for further study. We attempted to shortlist the candidate drugs using an in-silico approach. First, we analysed two published transcriptomic data sets of COVID-19- and SARS-infected patients compared to healthy individuals to find the key pathways altered after infection. Then, using publicly available drug perturbational data sets in human cell lines from the Broad Institute Connectivity Map (CMAP), we assessed the effects of the approved drugs on the altered pathways. We also used the available pharmacogenomic data sets from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) portal to assess the effects of the altered pathways on resistance or sensitivity to the drugs in human cell lines. Our analysis identified many candidate drugs, some of which are already being investigated for treatment of COVID-19 and can serve as a basis for prioritizing additional viable candidate drugs for COVID-19.",covid
"This study focuses on stigma communication about COVID-19 on Twitter in the early stage of the outbreak, given the lack of information and rapid global expansion of new cases during this period. Guided by the model of stigma communication, we examine four types of message content, namely mark, group labeling, responsibility, and peril, that are instrumental in forming stigma beliefs and sharing stigma messages. We also explore whether the presence of misinformation and conspiracy theories in COVID-19-related tweets is associated with the presence of COVID-19 stigma content. A total of 155,353 unique COVID-19-related tweets posted between December 31, 2019, and March 13, 2020, were identified, from which 7000 tweets were randomly selected for manual coding. Results showed that the peril of COVID-19 was mentioned the most often, followed by mark, responsibility, and group labeling content. Tweets with conspiracy theories were more likely to include group labeling and responsibility information, but less likely to mention COVID-19 peril. Public health agencies should be aware of the unintentional stigmatization of COVID-19 in public health messages and the urgency to engage and educate the public about the facts of COVID-19.",covid
"Although significant attention has been allocated to hospital management of COVID-19 patients during this pandemic, less discussed is the management of ambulatory patients. This has resulted in a challenge for ambulatory care providers in the management of COVID-19, particularly in areas with high disease prevalence. In this article, the authors share a pragmatic approach to ambulatory management of COVID-19 at Northwell Health, a large health system that employs approximately 300 primary care providers in the New York metro area. This includes guidance on various COVID-19 management topics: clinical assessment algorithms, guidance on patient tracking, and the importance of engaging in partnerships with other provider types. Sharing these experiences in the clinical management of COVID-19 may benefit other ambulatory providers in earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) infection has recently become a worldwide challenge with dramatic global economic and health consequences. As the pandemic is still spreading, new data concerning Covid-19 complications and related mechanisms become increasingly available. Accumulating data suggest that the incidence of cardiac arrest and its outcome are adversely affected during the Covid-19 period. This may be further exacerbated by drug-related cardiac toxicity of Covid-19 treatment regimens. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms that lead to Covid-19 associated cardiac arrest is imperative, not only in order to improve its effective management but also to maximize preventive measures. Herein we discuss available epidemiological data on cardiac arrest during the Covid-19 pandemic as well as possible associated causes and pathophysiological mechanisms and highlight gaps in evidence warranting further investigation. The risk of transmission during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is also discussed in this review. Finally, we summarize currently recommended guidelines on CPR for Covid-19 patients including CPR in patients with cardiac arrest due to suspected drug-related cardiac toxicity in an effort to underscore the most important common points and discuss discrepancies proposed by established international societies.",covid
"The world is suffering from an existential global health crisis known as the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries like India, Bangladesh, and other developing countries are still having a slow pace in the detection of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need for fast detection with clear visualization of infection is required using which a suspected patient of COVID-19 could be saved. In the recent technological advancements, the fusion of deep learning classifiers and medical images provides more promising results corresponding to traditional RT-PCR testing while making detection and predictions about COVID-19 cases with increased accuracy. In this paper, we have proposed a deep transfer learning algorithm that accelerates the detection of COVID-19 cases by using X-ray and CT-Scan images of the chest. It is because, in COVID-19, initial screening of chest X-ray (CXR) may provide significant information in the detection of suspected COVID-19 cases. We have considered three datasets known as 1) COVID-chest X-ray, 2) SARS-COV-2 CT-scan, and 3) Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia). In the obtained results, the proposed deep learning model can detect the COVID-19 positive cases in ≤ 2 seconds which is faster than RT-PCR tests currently being used for detection of COVID-19 cases. We have also established a relationship between COVID-19 patients along with the Pneumonia patients which explores the pattern between Pneumonia and COVID-19 radiology images. In all the experiments, we have used the Grad-CAM based color visualization approach in order to clearly interpretate the detection of radiology images and taking further course of action.",covid
"Appendectomy is the gold standard of treatment for acute appendicitis; however, recent evidence suggests conservative management with intravenous antibiotics may provide similar outcomes and can be used as an alternative in selected patients. Performing appendectomy in acute appendicitis patients with 2019 novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is challenging, as it involves considerable operative risks for the patients and risks for health care professionals (HCPs) exposed to COVID-19. Medical management eliminates the morbidity and mortality associated with surgery but involves significant risks of treatment failures that, in turn, may lead to perforation, peritonitis, and death. We are reporting a case of a middle-aged man with multiple co-morbidities, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and acute appendicitis. Our patient received intravenous antibiotics for seven days with a significant improvement in symptoms. Our case report illustrates the implementation of successful conservative treatment for acute appendicitis in COVID-19 patients.",covid
"Objectives: The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of transmission control efforts of the Philippine Government through implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) on curtailing the exponential growth of the Corona Virus (Covid-19). Also, this study provides forecast of transmission rate of Covid-19 incorporating the heterogeneous characteristics of the group of population according to age. Methods: The heterogeneous-mixing model was used to forecast the transmission rate of Covid-19 and effect of Enhanced Community Quarantine in various Local Government Units (LGUs) in the National Capital Region (NCR), Philippines. Results: The result of the study revealed that the mobility of people has significant contribution to the transmission rate of Covid-19. The result of the study revealed that the mobilization of workers, who are exempted in ECQ, would greatly affect the transmission of disease to those who are in the senior citizen group. The increase in the confirmed cases of Covid-19 is associated with the transmission from those workers, who are exempted from ECQ to senior citizens and the young age group. LGUs in the NCR, Philippines will experience a different pattern of peak periods ranging from the third week of April to the last week of May. Conclusions: This study concluded that in order to achieve the containment of the spread of Covid-19 in the Philippines, the government should be stricter in implementation of the ECQ and incorporate the different pattern of transmission of Covid-19 in deciding whether to extend or to lift the ECQ.",covid
"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals have adopted protocols geared to optimize the care of patients with COVID-19, while mitigating risk of exposure to other patients and to health care workers. These modifications can have un-intended consequences and impact the care of non-COVID patients. In the campaign against COVID-19, we must remain vigilant that patients with traditional disease processes also receive thoughtful and coordinated care.",covid
"The coronavirus pandemic is one of the biggest health crises of our time. In response to this global problem, various institutions around the world had soon issued evidence-based prevention guidelines. However, these guidelines, which were designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and contribute to public well-being, are (deliberately) disregarded by some individuals. In the present study, we aimed to develop and test a multivariate model that could help us identify individual characteristics that make a person more/less likely to comply with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. A total of 525 attentive participants completed the online survey. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that COVID-19 risk perception and trust in science both independently predict compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, while the remaining variables in the model (political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity) do so via the mediating role of trust in science. The described model exhibited an acceptable fit (χ2(1611) = 2485.84, p < .001, CFI = .91, RMSEA = .032, SRMR = .055). These findings thus provide empirical support for the proposed multivariate model and underline the importance of trust in science in explaining the different levels of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.",covid
"The world has been suffering incredible loss due to a pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2; 2019-nCoV). The disease was later named the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The transmission routes of COVID-19 include respiratory transmission, aerosol transmission, and contact transmission. Many dental diagnosis and treatment procedures generate droplets and aerosols, and thus both dental staff and patients are at a high risk of becoming infected and transmitting COVID-19 to others. Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital is a comprehensive hospital with 18 craniofacial-/dental-related departments. During the outbreak of COVID-19 and up to the present date, there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in this hospital thanks to strict protocols for infection prevention and control. In this communication, we would like to share with the prosthodontic community our experience in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in our dental departments and hope it will contribute to the worldwide efforts to overcome the global COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"With the recent outbreak of COVID-19, fast diagnostic testing has become one of the major challenges due to the critical shortage of test kit. Pneumonia, a major effect of COVID-19, needs to be urgently diagnosed along with its underlying reasons. In this paper, deep learning aided automated COVID-19 and other pneumonia detection schemes are proposed utilizing a small amount of COVID-19 chest X-rays. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture, named as CovXNet, is proposed that utilizes depthwise convolution with varying dilation rates for efficiently extracting diversified features from chest X-rays. Since the chest X-ray images corresponding to COVID-19 caused pneumonia and other traditional pneumonias have significant similarities, at first, a large number of chest X-rays corresponding to normal and (viral/bacterial) pneumonia patients are used to train the proposed CovXNet. Learning of this initial training phase is transferred with some additional fine-tuning layers that are further trained with a smaller number of chest X-rays corresponding to COVID-19 and other pneumonia patients. In the proposed method, different forms of CovXNets are designed and trained with X-ray images of various resolutions and for further optimization of their predictions, a stacking algorithm is employed. Finally, a gradient-based discriminative localization is integrated to distinguish the abnormal regions of X-ray images referring to different types of pneumonia. Extensive experimentations using two different datasets provide very satisfactory detection performance with accuracy of 97.4% for COVID/Normal, 96.9% for COVID/Viral pneumonia, 94.7% for COVID/Bacterial pneumonia, and 90.2% for multiclass COVID/normal/Viral/Bacterial pneumonias. Hence, the proposed schemes can serve as an efficient tool in the current state of COVID-19 pandemic. All the architectures are made publicly available at: https://github.com/Perceptron21/CovXNet.",covid
"Purpose: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is associated with a high mortality. However, the evolution of computed tomography (CT) manifestations of severe COVID-19 pneumonia remains unclear, more evidence regarding its evolution process is urgent needed. Method: The clinical, laboratory and imaging data of eleven patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were collected to investigate the evolution process of severe COVID-19 cases. Results: The main initial CT manifestations of severe COVID-19 pneumonia were multiple ground-glass opacities and/or consolidation. Evolution of CT manifestations showed that acute exudative lesions of severe COVID-19 pneumonia could be gradually resolved after active intervention. Conclusions: Most of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia showed marked improvement of acute exudative lesions on chest imagings, and satisfactory prognosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia could be achieved after active treatment.",covid
"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus, is highly contagious. Global medical systems have been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the majority of patients with intracranial disease require time-sensitive surgery, how to conduct neurosurgery and prevent and control nosocomial infection during a pandemic is challenging. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of patients undergoing neurosurgical and neurointerventional procedures at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, China during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic between January 21 and July 31, 2020. A 3-level system of COVID-19 risk was established based on medical conditions, epidemiologic, and symptom inquiry and the results of triage. A transitional unit was established for patients in whom COVID-19 had not been ruled out on admission to hospital. Results: A total of 4025 patients underwent neurosurgery during the study period, including 768 emergent and 3257 nonemergent procedures. Of these patients, 3722 were low-risk for COVID-19, 303 were moderate-risk, and none were high-risk. In addition, 1419 patients underwent neurointerventional procedures, including 114 emergent and 1305 nonemergent interventions, of which 1339 were low-risk patients, 80 were moderate-risk and none were high-risk. A total of 895 patients (neurosurgical and neurointerventional) were admitted to the transitional unit. Forty-five patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and transferred to the COVID-19 designated hospital. There were no cases of COVID-19 nosocomial infections among surgical patients or health care workers. Conclusion: On the basis of our single-center experience, developing a full screening protocol for COVID-19, establishing a risk level, and using a transitional unit for those with unknown COVID-19 status are effective measures to provide a safe environment for patients and health care workers.",covid
"COVID-19 pandemic has brought the need to revisit the conservative management of orthopaedic injuries back into sharp focus. On the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, it has been acknowledged by the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) emergency COVID-19 and the National Health Service England (NHSE) guidelines to manage urgent orthopaedic and trauma conditions pragmatically balancing optimum treatment of patients against clinical safety with resource utilization .The current Coronavirus outbreak has refocussed orthopaedic minds on managing many injuries conservatively, which would have otherwise been managed with operative fixations. We revisit the role of conservative orthopaedic management of fractures in the context of COVID-19 and current guidelines.",covid
"Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a new strain (SARS-CoV-2) erupted in 2019. Nowadays, it is a great threat that claims uncountable lives worldwide. There is no specific chemotherapeutics developed yet to combat COVID-19. Therefore, scientists have been devoted in the quest of the medicine that can cure COVID- 19. Objective: Existing antivirals such as ASC09/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir with or without umifenovir in combination with antimalarial chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have been repurposed to fight the current coronavirus epidemic. But exact biochemical mechanisms of these drugs towards COVID-19 have not been discovered to date. Method: In-silico molecular docking can predict the mode of binding to sort out the existing chemotherapeutics having a potential affinity towards inhibition of the COVID-19 target. An attempt has been made in the present work to carry out docking analyses of 34 drugs including antivirals and antimalarials to explain explicitly the mode of interactions of these ligands towards the COVID-19protease target. Results: 13 compounds having good binding affinity have been predicted towards protease binding inhibition of COVID-19. Conclusion: Our in silico docking results have been confirmed by current reports from clinical settings through the citation of suitable experimental in vitro data available in the published literature.",covid
"Seasonal variations in COVID-19 incidence have been suggested as a potentially important factor in the future trajectory of the pandemic. Using global line-list data on COVID-19 cases reported until 17th of March 2020 and global gridded weather data, we assessed the effects of air temperature and relative humidity on the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 local cases at the subnational level (first-level administrative divisions). After adjusting for surveillance capacity and time since first imported case, average temperature had a statistically significant, negative association with COVID-19 incidence for temperatures of -15°C and above. However, temperature only explained a relatively modest amount of the total variation in COVID-19 cases. The effect of relative humidity was not statistically significant. These results suggest that warmer weather may modestly reduce the rate of spread of COVID-19, but anticipation of a substantial decline in transmission due to temperature alone with onset of summer in the northern hemisphere, or in tropical regions, is not warranted by these findings.",covid
"Aim: To examine the relative influence of fear of COVID-19 on nurses' psychological distress, work satisfaction and intent to leave their organisation and the profession. Background: The emergence of COVID-19 has significantly impacted the psychological and mental well-being of frontline healthcare workers, including nurses. To date, no studies have been conducted examining how this fear of COVID-19 contributes to health, well-being and work outcomes in frontline nurses. Methods: This is a cross-sectional research design involving 261 frontline nurses in the Philippines. Five standardised scales were used for data collection. Results: Overall, the composite score of the fear of COVID-19 scale was 19.92. Job role and attendance of COVID-19-related training predicted fear of COVID-19. An increased level of fear of COVID-19 was associated with decreased job satisfaction, increased psychological distress, and increased organisational and professional turnover intentions. Conclusions: Frontline nurses who reported not having attended COVID-19-related training and those who held part-time job roles reported increased fears of COVID-19. Addressing the fear of COVID-19 may result in improved job outcomes in frontline nurses, such as increased job satisfaction, decreased stress levels and lower intent to leave the organisation and the profession. Implications for nursing management: Organisational measures are vital to support the mental health of nurses and address their fear of COVID-19 through peer and social support, psychological and mental support services (e.g., counselling or psychotherapy), provision of training related to COVID-19, and accurate and regular information updates.",covid
"Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is a novel corona virus that started as an outbreak in the Hubei province of China in December 2019 and later became a pandemic affecting every continent on the planet. Patients with severe COVID-19 tend to develop acute thrombotic complications including myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and ischemic stroke. We describe a case of a 75-year-old-female who presented with acute onset slurred speech and right sided facial droop. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 with acute ischemic stroke as the initial presentation. Stroke as the initial presentation of COVID-19 is rare and has not been described in the literature frequently. The purpose of this report is to raise awareness about this potential complication of COVID-19 as an initial presentation.",covid
"The global COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented effect on human behavior and well-being. Demographic factors and personality traits have been shown to independently influence whether individuals adopt adaptive or maladaptive coping responses. However, to date, researchers have not considered how demographics and personality could interact to influence COVID-19 coping responses. In a sample of 516 North American young adults, we found direct links from two demographic factors (i.e., income and having children) and from multiple personality traits (as captured by the HEXACO model) to adaptive and maladaptive COVID-19 coping responses. We also found that personality indirectly linked a broader range of demographic factors (income, age, gender, having children) with COVID-19 coping responses. We encourage future research on COVID-19 coping responses to consider not just the individual contributions of demographics and personality, but their interdependent influence on whether individuals adopt more or less adaptive COVID-19 pandemic coping responses.",covid
Stroke as a presenting feature of COVID-19 infection is being increasingly recognized.

"Background: Chronic pain patients require continuity of care even during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has drastically changed healthcare and other societal practices. The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) has created the COVID-ASIPP Risk Mitigation & Stratification (COVID-ARMS) Return to Practice Task Force in order to provide guidance for safe and strategic reopening. Objectives: The aims are to provide education and guidance for interventional pain specialists and their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic that minimizes COVID-related morbidity while allowing a return to interventional pain care. Methods: The methodology utilized included the development of objectives and key questions with utilization of trustworthy standards, appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest, as well as a panel of experts from various regions, specialities, and groups. The literature pertaining to all aspects of COVID-19, specifically related to epidemiology, risk factors, complications, morbidity and mortality, and literature related to risk mitigation and stratification were reviewed. The principles of best evidence synthesis of available literature and grading for recommendations as described by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) typically utilized in ASIPP guideline preparation was not utilized in these guidelines due to limitations because of their lack of available literature on COVID-19, risk mitigation and stratification. These guidelines are considered evidence -- informed with incorporation of best available research and practice knowledge. Consequently, these guidelines are considered evidence-informed with incorporation of best available research and practice knowledge. Results: Numerous risk factors have emerged that predispose patients to contracting COVID-19 and/or having a more severe course of the infection. COVID-19 may have mild symptoms, even be asymptomatic, or may be severe and life threatening. Older age and certain comorbidities, such as underlying pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, have been associated with worse outcomes. In pain care, COVID-19 patients are a heterogeneous group with some individuals relatively healthy and having only a short course of manageable symptoms while others become critically ill. It is necessary to assess patients on a case-by-case basis and craft individualized care recommendations. A COVID-ARMS risk stratification tool was created to quickly and objectively assess patients. Interventional pain specialists and their patients may derive important benefits from evidence-informed risk stratification, protective strategies to prevent infection, and the gradual resumption of treatments and procedures to manage pain. Limitations: COVID-19 was an ongoing pandemic at the time during which these recommendations were developed. The pandemic has created a fluid situation in terms of evidence-informed guidance. As more and better evidence is gathered, these recommendations may be modified. Conclusions: Chronic pain patients require continuity of care but during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, steps must be taken to stratify risks and protect patients from possible infection to safeguard them from COVID-19-related illness and transmitting the disease to others. Pain specialists should optimize telemedicine encounters with their pain patients, be cognizant of risks of COVID-19 morbidity, and take steps to evaluate risk-benefit on a case-by-case basis. Pain specialists may return to practice with lower-risk patients and appropriate safeguards.",covid
"Patients with COVID-19 infection may present to the Emergency Department (ED) with gastrointestinal complaints and no respiratory symptoms. We are presenting 3 patients who came to the ED with abdominal pain; and the computed tomography [CT] of the abdomen showed findings suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. A 65-year-old male patient presented with symptoms of urinary tract infection and left renal angle tenderness. A 42-year-old male patient presented with right flank pain postextracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. A 71-year-old male known to have type 2 diabetes mellitus and who had had whipple surgery for a neoplasm of the head of the pancreas presented with a painful epigasteric swelling. The 3 patients had positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and mild-to-moderate illness, and were discharged home after 2 weeks with a good recovery. The first patient had a false negative early PCR test, which turned positive on 2 repetitions of the test. A systematic review of CT abdomen, including inspection of the lung bases using the lung window in all CT abdomen, is essential to detect findings suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients requiring a CT abdomen study. As proven in the literature, CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia have a higher sensitivity than the PCR test.",covid
"Introduction: COVID-19 has had a profound effect on the NHS. Little information has been published as to how the unselected medical take has been affected. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients who were referred to general medicine during March 2020. We compared clinical outcomes of patients with and without COVID-19. Results: 814 patients were included, comprising 777 unique patients. On average, 26 patients were admitted per day. 38% of admitted patients were suspected of COVID-19, with greater numbers of COVID-19 patients in the second half compared to the first half of the month (p<0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed suspected COVID-19 was an independent predictor for inpatient mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 6.09, p<0.001) and 30-day mortality (OR = 4.66, p<0.001). Conclusions: COVID-19 patients had worse clinical outcomes and increased healthcare use compared to non-COVID-19 patients. Our study highlights some of the challenges in healthcare provision faced during this pandemic.",covid
"As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, the medical community continues to discover novel clinical manifestations of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Often, extrapulmonary manifestations occur simultaneously with pulmonary disease. However, there is a paucity of literature describing the cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 in the absence of pulmonary findings. We report a rare case of acute pericarditis presenting with pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade in a 43-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19. This case emphasizes the importance of continued investigation regarding diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and its related symptoms.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to individuals fearing COVID-19 infection alongside conditions such anxiety, depression, trauma, and stress.

It was alleged that a woman committed suicide at a hospital because she was not treated and because doctors and nurses suspected she was infected with COVID-19 and did not want to get infected themselves. To help allay the fears among HCPs and the patients they are treating with COVID-19, a number of initiatives are suggested.",covid
"Background: People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experienced changes in health behaviors and access to MS care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The USA has the highest recognized number of Covid19 infections globally. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 has not been well characterized in large samples of PwMS to date. The MS patient perspective on COVID-19 would complement the physician-reported cases of MS and COVID-19 in the literature. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of adult PwMS was performed online, using the U.S.-based patient-powered iConquerMS™ platform, in April 2020. Results: There were 1,145 respondents (response rate: 20%). 1,019 had a diagnosis of MS and responded completely (average age: 54.2 years, range: 20-81; 79% female; 64% relapsing remitting, 22% secondary progressive, 12% primary progressive; 88% in the USA). 748 (73%) used a DMT in the last year, primarily higher-efficacy therapies: ocrelizumab (n=238), dimethyl fumarate (n=85), fingolimod (n=80). The most frequent comorbidities were depression (41%), hypertension (26%), and asthma (12%). Women were more worried than men about COVID-19 (p=0.001); non-white-identifying PwMS believed it was a greater danger to their health than white-identifying PwMS (p=0.002). Through the continuum of symptoms to care, 61% of PwMS (n=617) reported symptoms associated with COVID-19, 39% (n=395) knew someone exposed to COVID-19, 4% (n=38) were aware of a personal COVID-19 exposure, 13% (n=128) wanted testing for COVID-19 but could not access it, and 4% (n=43) were tested. Specific to their MS care, 64% (n=650) canceled a medical visit, 22% (n=222) canceled a neurologist visit, 11% (n=112) canceled an MRI, 21% (n=212) canceled a laboratory test, and 10% (n=98) changed their DMT in some way due to COVID19 including 65 delaying at least one dose. 37% (n=382) had a telehealth visit due to COVID-19. 37% of PwMS (n=374) experienced employment changes, most commonly working from home (n=194) and having work hours reduced (n=65) while 32 lost their jobs. Of the 7 cases who tested positive for COVID-19 (<1% of participants) (5 female; age range: 29-64 years), DMTs included dimethyl fumarate (n=2), ocrelizumab (n=1), rituximab (n=1), and a clinical trial drug (n=1). Conclusions: A majority of people with MS reported interruptions to their MS care along the MS care pathway alongside limited access to COVID-19 testing. Postponements and delays in care were common with 10% of participants reporting a change in their DMT administration. Less than 1% of this self-referred convenience online cohort had a positive test for COVID-19 although more than half reported symptoms that are associated with COVID-19.",covid
We describe three patients with COVID-19 who presented with an acute vascular event rather than with typical respiratory symptoms. These patients were all subsequently found to have laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections as the likely cause of their thrombotic event. The primary presentation of COVID-19 infection as a thrombotic event rather than with respiratory symptoms has not been described elsewhere. Our cases and discussion highlight the thrombotic complications caused by COVID-19; we discuss management of these patients and explore the role of anticoagulation in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.,covid
"Objective: The aim of this study was to analyse both the impact of the pandemic and clinical and teaching organisation in Spanish Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Departments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A survey was conducted of the tutors of rehabilitation departments. The questionnaire contained 31 questions divided into 6 parts about the following: general information on the department, adaptation of rehabilitation departments to the COVID pandemic, clinical work of rehabilitation physicians, the approach to rehabilitation in COVID patients, and the effects of the pandemic on the health and teaching activity of rehabilitation physicians during this period. Results: A total of 54 responses were obtained. Almost half of the departments cancelled face-to-face medical consultations (40%) and 48% of the treatment rooms were turned into COVID beds. In 30 hospitals (55.6%), the physicians worked in COVID units. Most of the rehabilitation departments developed both graphic and audiovisual material with exercises, referral protocols and guidelines for the rehabilitation management and treatment of COVID 19 patients. Half of the departments reported some anxiety symptoms in medical staff. Tutorial work has been cancelled (40.7%) or reduced (35.2%). Conclusions: The organisation of Spanish rehabilitation departments in response to the COVID pandemic has been very similar throughout the country. The response of these departments to the healthcare crisis has revealed the versatility of rehabilitation physicians.",covid
"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted patient care across the NHS. Following the suspension of elective surgery, priority was placed in providing urgent and emergency surgery for patients with no alternative treatment. We aim to assess the outcomes of patients undergoing cardiac surgery who have COVID-19 infection diagnosed in the early postoperative period. We identified 9 patients who developed COVID-19 infection following cardiac surgery. These patients had a significant length of hospital stay and extremely poor outcomes with mortality of 44%. In conclusion, the outcome of cardiac surgical patients who contracted COVID-19 infection perioperatively is extremely poor. In order to offer cardiac surgery, units must implement rigorous protocols aimed at maintaining a COVID-19 protective environment to minimize additional life-threatening complications related to this virus infection.",covid
"Introduction: The COVID-19 outbreak has become a worldwide public health emergency. The renal histopathological features of acute tubular necrosis or thrombotic microangiopathy have been previously reported in adults with severe COVID-19 infections. In children, the renal manifestations associated with COVID-19 disease are not widely reported. Here we describe a case report of a child with new-onset nephrotic syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection. Case Presentation: An 8-year-old boy with no previous significant medical history presented with bilateral eyelid and facial swelling soon after his parents were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. He had diarrhea but no fever or shortness of breath. At 1 week after the onset of swelling, the boy tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. Based on clinical findings of significant proteinuria (urine protein and creatinine ratio of 11.4), hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin of 2 g/dl), and hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol of 384 mg/dl), he was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome. He responded well to standard-dose prednisone treatment for nephrotic syndrome. At 1 week after starting the prednisone treatment, he went into clinical remission. Lymphopenia continued to be present for 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. There were no complications related to clot formation or secondary infections with this presentation. Conclusion: COVID-19 can be associated with new-onset nephrotic syndrome in children. The patient responded well to the standard-dose prednisone treatment that is typically used for new-onset nephrotic syndrome. Summary: We describe the unique presentation of COVID-19 in a child as new-onset nephrotic syndrome. We offer insight on the success of standard treatment of nephrotic syndrome with COVID-19.",covid
"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, food insecurity has doubled overall and tripled among households with children in the United States. Food insecurity and COVID-19 may exacerbate one another through bidirectional links, leading to a syndemic, or sequential disease clusters, which exacerbate one another. Experiencing food insecurity may be associated with macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies, which can weaken host defenses, thus increasing susceptibility to COVID-19. Food insecurity is associated with chronic medical conditions, which may afford a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness. People experiencing food insecurity may have increased exposure to COVID-19 while procuring food. People with COVID-19 may be unable to work, generate income, and procure food while quarantined, which may exacerbate food insecurity. Clinicians should screen for food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide referrals to food-assistance programs when appropriate. Policymakers should expand benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to address increases in the depth and breadth of food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"This study examines the impact of COVID-19 (in the early phase of the outbreak) on symptoms of psychosis, namely paranoia and hallucinations. Three hundred and sixty-one people in the United Kingdom participated in a 2 (self-isolation vs. no self-isolation) x 2 (perceived COVID-19 symptomatology vs. no perceived COVID-19 symptomatology) x 2 (exposure to COVID-19 news vs. control) experiment online. Participants completed measures of political trust, social network, fear of COVID-19, current paranoid thoughts, hallucinatory experiences and compulsive buying. Kruskal-Wallis results showed that employed people and students are more prone to paranoia and hallucinatory experiences in response to COVID-19 news. A multigroup model showed a moderation effect of the news conditions - in the COVID-19 news condition, fear of COVID-19 and political trust significantly predict the variance of paranoia, hallucinatory experiences and compulsive buying and these co-vary with each other but not in the control condition. In line with cognitive and social theories of paranoia, results suggest that negative affect and low political trust are linked to the presence of paranoid thoughts and hallucinatory experiences and compulsive buying amid COVID-19. Digitized and Tailored Cognitive and Behavioral Therapy are proposed to address the psychiatric impact of COVID-19.",covid
"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been identified as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The breakout of COVID-19 in various countries and regions brings a great threat to people's life and adds an unprecedented high pressure on healthcare systems. Due to the high infectivity of COVID-19, high standard negative pressure isolation units are required to accommodate the patients with COVID-19 and protect health workers. A novel prefabricated negative pressure isolation medical unit was designed and constructed in Shenzhen, China to help to accommodate the patients with COVID-19. This article provides detailed construction cost, time and testing data for this isolation medical unit. Considering the construction happened during the lockdown in Shenzhen (and in China), the construction cost and time can provide precious and rare information as well as guidelines to construct or expand appropriate medical facilities to accommodate the patients with COVID-19.",covid
"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had become a global public health event. Lymphoma patients need to be distinguished from the general population because of their deficient immune status and intensive anti-tumor treatment. The impacts of cancer subtypes and treatment on COVID-19 infection are unclear. Case Presentation: We here report the case of a primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma patient who was infected with COVID-19 after intensive immunochemotherapy (DA-EPOCH-R). The patient developed a neutropenic fever during chemotherapy, and fever was persistent, although antibiotics were used. Initial chest CT was negative, and the patient received a throat swab test since the second CT showed evidence of pneumonia. With treatment with Arbidol Hydrochloride and LianHuaQingWen capsule, his COVID-19 was cured. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report focusing on COVID-19 infection in a lymphoma patient undergoing intensive immunochemotherapy. For those patients being treated with immunochemotherapy in epidemic areas, a reduced dose intensity of intensive chemotherapy should be considered, and the effect of immunotherapies such as rituximab on COVID-19 infection should be considered. The impacts of anti-cancer treatment on COVID-19 infection need to be explored further.",covid
"COVID-19 is proving to be a devastating pandemic with both tragic economic and health consequences worldwide. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) of the lungs has been thrust into the forefront of resources that could be used in the management of COVID-19 acute care patients. However, relatively little attention has been paid to POCUS utility in assessing the heart in COVID-19 patients. Anecdotal reports suggest encounters of likely COVID-19 induced pericardial effusions and myocardial electrical dysfunction.

POCUS videos are presented as illustrations of this potentially overlooked complication.",covid
"Objective: Coronavirus disease is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 have been examined but Socio-economic aspects of the issue have been less studied. Thus this study aimed to identify the role of human development index (HDI) in the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 worldwide. Methods: Information of the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 was obtained from the Worldometer and data about the HDI 2019 were obtained from the World Bank database. The correlation between incidence, mortality rates, and the HDI parameters were assessed using linear regression. We calculated concentration index (CI) to measure socioeconomic inequality in COVID-19 related mortality & incidence. Results: linear regression analysis showed a direct significant correlation between the incidence and mortality rate from COVID-19 and HDI at the global level. The concentration index was positive for incidence rate (0.62) and mortality rate (0.69) of COVID-19, indicating the higher concentration of the rates among groups with high HDI. Conclusions: The high incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in countries with high and very high HDI are remarkable which should be the top priority of interventions for global health policymakers. Also, the health programs should be provided to reduce the burden of this disease in the regions with high incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19.",covid
"The purpose of the present study was to propose and test two models to understand the relationship between perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 (PVC) and COVID-19-related traumatic stress (TS), as well as the variables that may mediate and moderate this relationship among individuals who have not yet been infected with COVID-19. Using an online survey, data were collected between late March and early April 2020. Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk and included 747 adults living in the United States. Supporting our hypotheses, results indicated that both COVID-19-related worries and social isolation were significant mediators of the relationship between PVC and TS (Model 1). In addition, the results of a moderated mediation analysis indicated that the indirect effect of PVC on TS through COVID-19-related worries was stronger for participants who reported greater social isolation (Model 2). Although future research is needed, these findings suggest that both social isolation and disease-related worries may be important variables that can be targeted in interventions to reduce pandemic-related TS.",covid
"There have been many cases of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infections in China and around the world. This will inevitably lead to a rise in the number of patients. At the present time, clinical and forensic autopsies have given guidance and explanations in relation to the problem of COVID-19 transmission and defense. However, less attention is paid to the handling of COVID-19 biological samples in forensic practice. Particularly, COVID-19 can survive on some surfaces for days. Since there were many cases involving COVID-19 during the epidemic, this article shares the methods and strategies for handling such inspection materials and the biological samples related specifically to COVID-19 cases.",covid
"Malaysia recorded 8904 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases and 124 deaths as of 27 July 2020. Globally, everyday there are thousands of new cases of COVID-19 being recorded. Due to the high number of infections globally and nationwide the increase in the amount of clinical waste (CW) generation was expected. Malaysia has reported a 27% (by weight) increase in the generation of CW which was mostly attributed to COVID-19 related waste. This article presents the impacts of COVID-19 in waste generation, policy and regulation of CW management (CWM) in Malaysia and a case study on the CWM at a selected hospital used as a COVID-19 focal point. The current practice of CWM due to COVID-19 related cases follows the existing policy and legislation of CWM detailed in the Schedule Waste Regulation (2005), Environmental Quality Act, 1974, and with the standard operating procedure provided by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia. The case study conducted through survey and questionnaire interviews revealed that the CWM in government hospitals followed existing guidelines for CWM for COVID-19 waste, with some additional precautions and rules by the waste management contractors.",covid
"At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases, with high needs of mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. It is still unclear whether different types of COVID-19 pneumonia require different ventilator strategies. With electrical impedance tomography (EIT) we evaluated, in real time and bedside, the distribution of ventilation in the different pulmonary regions before, during, and after pronation in COVID-19 respiratory failure. We present a brief literature review of EIT in non-COVID-19 patients and a report of 2 COVID-19 patients: one that did not respond well and another one that improved during and after pronation. EIT might be a useful tool to decide whether prone positioning should or should not be used in COVID-19 pneumonia.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been compared to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Multiple similarities between the two conditions were drawn in the past. This article seeks to further clarify potential underlying mechanisms related to hypoxia and pulmonary vascular responses. It does so by looking at perfusion imaging of patients with COVID-19 and comparing them with patterns observed in HAPE and hypoxic exposure. Two separate clinical cases are reviewed. The salient aspect of each case that is emphasized is the perfusion scintigraphy results that revealed heterogeneous perfusion patterns in both patients. Heterogeneous or non-homogeneous perfusion is also observed in HAPE. A detailed clinical course of each patient is described. Medications utilized to treat the conditions are outlined as well as laboratory parameters and clinical findings. Interestingly, both of these patients were treated with calcium channel blockers and this class of medications is utilized to prevent HAPE as well. Discussion following the case presentations attempts to contextualize possible implications of this and other studies on the broader pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease. Findings related to pathophysiologic patterns and treatment strategies are also described. Micro-thrombi formation has been reported in both COVID-19 and HAPE as well and may be an accessory complication of perfusion compromise. In a separate study, vasodilatation with calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy has been associated with improved mortality in COVID-19 and potential pathophysiologic mechanisms were previously presented. This case report provides further clinical findings that support the notion that perfusion deficits are an integral component of hypoxia in COVID-19. It also advances the basis for use of vasodilator therapy as part of treatment regimens in COVID-19. Vasodilators may improve micro-perfusion. In this way, oxygenation may be promoted by decreasing impedance and improving flow via the alveolar-capillary unit.",covid
"Some of the reported neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are encephalopathy, headache, ischemic, hemorrhagic stroke, Miller Fisher syndrome, cranial neuropathies, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. We report a case of a 75-year-old COVID-19 patient with life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. The initial labs on admission showed D-dimer of 1.04 µg/mL, which increased to 3.74 µg/mL the next day, PT/INR of 13.7 seconds/1.2, aPTT of 22 seconds, fibrinogen of 386 mg/dL, WBC of 9.71 K/µL, Hgb of 14.1 g/dL, platelet of 315 x 103/µL, LDH of 965 U/L, and CRP of 35.2 mg/dL. In addition to aspirin and Plavix (clopidogrel), the patient was started on a therapeutic dose of enoxaparin due to elevated D-dimer. A few days later, the patient had a change in the neurological examination. The CT of the head without contrast revealed a left-sided acute subdural hematoma, causing left to right midline shift, a large left temporal intraparenchymal, and subarachnoid hemorrhage with transtentorial herniation, leading to death. This case illustrates a combination of factors including hypertension, triple therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel, and enoxaparin), and underlying coagulopathy due to COVID-19, which contributed to the life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage in this patient. Therefore, this raises a concern about the safety of starting these patients preemptively on a therapeutic dose of anticoagulation.",covid
"The institution of social distancing and punitive measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 through human-to-human transmission has environmental, health and economic impact. While the global pandemic has led to the enhancement of the health system and decline of emissions, economic development appears deteriorating. Here, we present the global environmental, health and economic dimension of the effect of COVID-19 using qualitative and empirical assessments. We report the health system policies, environmental sustainability issues, and fiscal, monetary and exchange rate measures introduced during lockdown across countries. While air pollution is reported to have declined, municipal and medical waste is increasing. The COVID-19 global pandemic uncertainty ranks the UK as the country with the highest uncertainty level among 143 countries. The USA has introduced 100% of pre-COVID-19 crisis level GDP, the highest policy cut-rate among 162 countries. Science, innovation, research and development underpin COVID-19 containment measures implemented across countries. Our study demonstrates the need for future research to focus on environment-health-economic nexus-a trilemma that has a potential trade-off.",covid
"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a respiratory tract infection has been noted to be a causative agent for acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and multiple organ failure.

"Given the extreme importance of the current pandemic caused by COVID-19 and due to the fact that scientists agree that there is no identified treatment, this paper analyzes in detail the treatment of a severe COVID-19 patient with convalescent plasma and drugs based on current guidelines for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment. This can provide a reference for other medical institutions on rational drug use and pharmaceutical care for severe COVID-19 patients.",covid
"The practice of otolaryngology has been drastically altered as a consequence of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Geographic heterogeneity in COVID-19 burden has meant different regions have experienced the pandemic at different stages. Regional dynamics of COVID-19 incidence has dictated the available resources for the provision of surgical care. As regions navigate their own COVID-19 dynamics, illustrative examples of areas affected early by the COVID-19 pandemic may provide anticipatory guidance. In this commentary, we discuss our experience with performed and canceled surgical procedures across the various otolaryngology specialties at our institution over the course of regionally rising and falling incident COVID-19 cases.",covid
"Treatment with tocilizumab (TCZ) to block interleukin-6 (IL-6) signalling is predicted to mitigate cytokine release syndrome (CRS) caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the adverse effects of TCZ on patients with COVID-19 remain unclear. We herein report a patient with COVID-19 treated with TCZ who developed acute hypertriglyceridaemia. Despite favipiravir treatment, acute respiratory distress syndrome developed in a 45-year-old patient with COVID-19; thus, TCZ was initiated. The triglyceride levels greatly increased after TCZ administration. Physicians should consider the negative impact of TCZ on the lipid profile in patients with COVID-19, although COVID-19-induced CRS itself may be an aggravating factor.",covid
"This study report focuses on facts on a pregnant woman of COVID-19 who admitted to Al Ahsa Maternity and Children Hospital on March 2020, with suspicion of COVID-19 infection. The patient was complaining of labor pain prior to presentation. The objective of this study is to report the case and to describe the challenges that are faced while dealing with a case of COVID-19 pregnant patient, during labor, delivery, and surgical intervention. This case reports a patient in labor pain with suspicion of COVID-19 infection due to contact with a positive COVID-19 family member. With no clinical signs or symptoms consistent with the disease, and positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) outcome for COVID-19 later on, the hospital main departments conducted an active contact tracing and reviewed the preparation and infection prevention control precautions. The most common problem with COVID-19 is the low level of awareness between healthcare workers related to infection prevention and transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The illness can be better handled and the medical team can be more secure by enhancing the education, case triage, proper guideline and protocols to be implemented appropriately.",covid
"Covid-19 is a virus that has created tension and devastation around the globe. This study is designed to specifically find out the effect of Covid-19 on the socioeconomic well-being of Nigerians, the health sector preparedness to handle the pandemic, and the role of Nigerian social workers in the fight against Covid-19 in Nigeria. The study employed a phenomenological and exploratory research design in its inquiry. Sixteen respondents made up the sample size for the study. A Focus Group Discussion Guide and an In-Depth Interview Guide were the instruments for data collection. The result of the study shows that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the socioeconomic well-being of Nigerians. Second, the Nigerian health system is ill equipped and underprepared to handle the Covid-19 pandemic. Third, Nigerian social workers, most especially medical social workers, have played a significant role in passing out information on Covid-19 preventive measures to the general public. The study recommends that the Nigerian government should wake up and fix the health sector and make it proactive to handle epidemics/pandemics in the future. Social work practice in Nigeria should be promoted by the government through institutionalization of the profession.",covid
Pregnant women are susceptible population of COVID-19 which are more likely to have complications and even progress to severe illness. Pregnancy with COVID-19 and neonates are rarely reported. We report a newborn with normal IgM and elevated IgG antibodies born to an asymptomatic infection mother with COVID-19. We assessed whether there was intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19.,covid
Neurological manifestations are common in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We present three cases of COVID-19 patients with seizures. Two patients had a history of seizures but very well controlled. They presented with seizure activity likely triggered by COVID-19. The third patient had no history of seizures and presented with new onset of seizure activity. All these patients were routinely screened for COVID-19 on admission and tested positive on nasopharyngeal real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). None of these patients had respiratory symptoms. Electroencephalography (EEG) was abnormal in all three patients. All these patients recovered and were discharged in a stable condition.,covid
"Objectives: To Evaluate the results and the protocols of our Institution for 18 Emergency and Urgent Non Covid Surgeries during the Covid 19 Pandemic. Methods: 18 patients underwent Emergency and Urgent Orthopaedic Surgeries at institution. The Protocol was Screening, Segregation, Selection, Isolation, theatre modification, and Online Follow. Results: Two adverse events including, one death and one intensive care admission due to underlying morbidity were recorded. Average Hospital stay was 2.5 days with no patients becoming covid positive at follow up. Conclusion: Strict Surgical protocols need to be followed for surgery during the Covid19 pandemic.",covid
"Background: Many people living with HIV (PLWH) have comorbidities which are risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or have exposures that may lead to acquisition of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2. There are few studies, however, on the demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, or outcomes of COVID-19 in people with HIV. Objective: To evaluate risk factors, clinical manifestations, and outcomes in a large cohort of PLWH with COVID-19. Methods: We systematically identified all PLWH who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at a large hospital from 3 March to 26 April 2020 during an outbreak in Massachusetts. We analyzed each of the cases to extract information including demographics, medical comorbidities, clinical presentation, and illness course after COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: We describe a cohort of 36 PLWH with confirmed COVID-19 and another 11 patients with probable COVID-19. Almost 85% of PLWH with confirmed COVID-19 had a comorbidity associated with severe disease, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, or hypertension. Approximately 77% of PLWH with COVID-19 were non-Hispanic Black or Latinx whereas only 40% of the PLWH in our clinic were Black or Latinx. Nearly half of PLWH with COVID-19 had exposure to congregate settings. In addition to people with confirmed COVID-19, we identified another 11 individuals with probable COVID-19, almost all of whom had negative PCR testing. Conclusion: In the largest cohort to date of PLWH and confirmed COVID-19, almost all had a comorbidity associated with severe disease, highlighting the importance of non-HIV risk factors in this population. The racial disparities and frequent link to congregate settings in PLWH and COVID-19 need to be explored urgently.",covid
"The global confirmed cases of COVID-19 have surpassed 7 million with over 400,000 deaths reported. However, 20 out of 187 countries and territories have over 2 million confirmed cases alone, a situation which calls for a critical assessment. The social distancing and preventive measures instituted across countries have a link with spread containment whereas spread containment is associated with meteorological factors. Here, we examine the effect of meteorological factors on COVID-19 health outcomes. We develop conceptual tools with dew/frost point, temperature, disaggregate temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, precipitation and surface pressure against confirmed cases, deaths and recovery cases. Using novel panel estimation techniques, our results find strong evidence of causation between meteorological factors and COVID-19 outcomes. We report that high temperature and high relative humidity reduce the viability, stability, survival and transmission of COVID-19 whereas low temperature, wind speed, dew/frost point, precipitation and surface pressure prolong the activation and infectivity of the virus. Our study demonstrates the importance of applying social distancing and preventive measures to mitigate the global pandemic.",covid
"In January 2020, the Florida Department of Health began planning for a potential coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The first 2 cases of COVID-19 in Florida were confirmed on March 1, 2020. The state's multiagency response to the COVID-19 pandemic was based on the Florida STEPS plan: (1) social distancing, (2) testing and contact tracing, (3) elderly and medically vulnerable population protection, (4) preparing hospitals for a patient surge and health care worker protection, and (5) stopping the introduction of COVID-19 into the state. This brief report describes COVID-19 response strategies and outcomes in Florida through May 31, 2020.",covid
"Background: Aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the shoulder and elbow trauma in a skeletally immature population in 30 days starting from the March 8 2020, the first day of restrictions in Italy, and to compare it with the same days of 2019. Materials and methods: All the skeletally immature (younger than 18 ys) patients managed in the Emergency Unit of our Hospital between March 8 2020 and 8thApril 2020 (COVID-19 period, C19) for a shoulder and elbow trauma were retrospectively included and compared to patients with similar ages admitted in the same period of 2019 (no COVID-19 period, NC19). Six categories of diagnosis were distinguished: 1) contusions, 2) no physeal fractures, 3) physeal fractures (Salter-Harris), 4) sprains/subluxations,5) dislocations, 6) others (tendinitis, wounds, low back pain, joint inflammation). According to the mechanism of injury we arbitrarily distinguished 6 subgroups: a) Accidental fall;b) Sport trauma; c) Accident at school; d) High energy trauma occurred by car, public transport, pedestrian investment; e) Fall from high. Results: During the C19 period, the number of total accesses in our Trauma Center steeply decreased: two thirds less. Regardless of the patient age, we performed 65% less first aid shoulder/elbow services. Skeletally immature patients treated at our Trauma Center for all types of injury during the NC19 period were 350 and 54 during the C19 period; therefore, the influx of pediatric patients during the C19 period decreased by 84.6%. Furthermore: a) in the C19 period there were no cases of fractures, physeal fractures and dislocations of the shoulder; b) in the C19 period we had no cases of contusion, physeal fractures, and dislocations of the elbow; c) during the C19 period we observed the absence of high-energy, sports and school injuries; d) during the pandemic, shoulder and elbow injuries mainly occurred as a result of accidental fall at home. Conclusions: The pandemic forced us to become aware of the ways and places where skeletally immature subjects report shoulder and elbow traumas; therefore, it would be desirable that more considerable attention be directed towards the prevention of injury in areas at risk.",covid
"As of May 14, 2020, the World Health Organization has reported approximately 4.3 million cases of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) with approximately 294,046 deaths worldwide [1]. Solid organ transplant recipients who are on chronic immunosuppressants fall within a special population of COVID-19 patients since they are more susceptible to complications secondary to COVID-19. Currently, we do not have data on treating COVID-19 patients with solid organ transplants with tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor. We report a case of COVID-19 in a patient with a kidney and liver transplant and discuss the early use of tocilizumab to prevent the cytokine storm and attempt to reduce the likelihood of progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In addition, we present other COVID-19 related transplant cases reported in the literature outlining the presenting clinical signs and outcomes.",covid
"An emerging viral infection is a global public health challenge. The development of modern, fast, and extensive transportation makes the outbreak hard to contain. Everyone is at risk, and the outbreak can rapidly turn into a pandemic crisis, like what we are currently facing for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Prompt diagnosis of the case is required to improve patients' prognosis and control of the outbreak. The common manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, cough, dyspnea, and malaise. However, patients may present with atypical symptoms that pose a diagnostic challenge. We report the first case of an elderly male who presented with rhabdomyolysis and later was diagnosed with COVID-19. Clinicians should be aware that rhabdomyolysis can be an initial presentation of COVID-19 or can occur at any time during the disease course. Patients with rhabdomyolysis should receive aggressive fluid administration to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI). However, COVID-19 patients are at risk of worsening oxygenation and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure from fluid overload. Therefore, cautious fluid administration is needed in COVID-19 patients with rhabdomyolysis.",covid
"Disabled people may be disproportionately impacted by the response to the COVID-19 outbreak because of the kinds of countermeasures needed to tackle it, and serious disruptions to the services on which they rely.

"New York City has been described as the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. While health care workers are notably at increased risk for COVID-19 infection, the impact on resident physicians remains unclear. In this issue of the JCI, Breazzano et al. surveyed resident physicians for their exposure to COVID-19 during the exponential phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers also assessed how personal protective equipment and COVID-19 testing protected health care workers from infection.

"Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the most challenging health crisis that we are facing today. Against the backdrop of this pandemic, it becomes imperative to study the effects of this infection on pregnancy and its outcome. Hence, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 infection on the maternal morbidity and mortality, the course of labour as well as the neonatal outcome. Materials and methods: A total of 977 pregnant women were included in the study, from 1st April to 15th May 2020 at a tertiary care hospital. There were 141 women who tested COVID positive and remaining 836 patients were included in the COVID negative group. Findings were compared in both the groups. Results: The incidence of COVID positive pregnant women was found to be 14.43%. More patients delivered by LSCS in the COVID positive and the COVID negative group (50%) as compared to COVID negative group (47%), (p > 0.05). Low APGAR score (0-3) was observed in 2(1.52%) neonates of COVID positive mothers and in 15 (1.91%) neonates of COVID negative mothers. Overall most of the babies were healthy. Out of all babies tested, 3 were detected positive initially which were retested on day 5 and were found to be negative. Conclusion: There is no significant effect of COVID infection on maternal and foetal outcome in pregnancy and there is no evidence of vertical transmission of the COVID-19 infection but long-term follow-up of these babies is recommended.",covid
"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily involves the respiratory system. Consumptive coagulopathy is seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure (MOF).

She responded well to corticosteroids.",covid
"Background: Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, it is not universally available and may have limitations in response times. The aim was to evaluate the routine blood tests for diagnosis of COVID-19, determining the diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers to differentiate between patients with and without COVID-19. Methods: Clinical charts, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-rays from adult patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 (fever, cough and/or dyspnea) at hospital admission were reviewed. Patients were classified into two groups according to RT-PCR COVID-19: positive (COVID-19) or negative (NON-COVID-19). Diagnostic accuracy was determined by analyzing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the cutoff value. In order to reduce the number of false positives, the cutoff value with a specificity of 80% was considered. Results: Two hundred three patients (101 females, 102 males) with ages between 18 and 96 years (mean = 61.3) were studied. Ninety-four were COVID-19 and 109 were NON-COVID-19. Plasma ferritin level was the most accurate biomarker (AUC = 0.847 and 0.804 in women and men, respectively). The following diagnostic criteria for suspected COVID-19 were established with biomarker cutoff values to differentiate between COVID-19 and NON-COVID-19 patients: lymphocytes ≤ 1.0 x 109/L; eosinophils ≤ 0.02 x 109/L; ferritin > 125% of upper reference limit (URL); LDH > 125% of URL; hsCRP > 80 mg/L; and D-dimer > 1.2 mg/L. Sensitivity was 66%, 64% 62%, 46%, 43%, and 33% for ferritin, eosinophils, LDH, hsCRP, lymphocytes, and D-dimer, respectively. Of those determined to be COVID-19 patients, 91% met one or more of the diagnostic criteria with these blood biomarkers, and of the NON-COVID-19 patients, 47% did not met any diagnostic criteria. Conclusions: Blood counts of lymphocytes and eosinophils, and plasma levels of D-dimer, LDH, hsCRP, and ferritin can be used to differentiate patients with and without COVID-19 and as a tool for diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 in adult patients at hospital admission.",covid

"As of July 2020, approximately 6 months into the pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), whether people living with HIV (PLWH) are disproportionately affected remains an unanswered question. Thus far, risk of COVID-19 in people with and without HIV appears similar but data are sometimes contradictory. Some uncertainty is due to the recency of the emergence of COVID-19 and sparsity of data; some is due to imprecision about what it means for HIV to be a ""risk factor"" for COVID-19. Forthcoming studies on the risk of COVID-19 to PLWH should differentiate between 1) the unadjusted, excess burden of disease among PLWH to inform surveillance efforts; and 2) any excess risk of COVID-19 among PLWH due to biological effects of HIV, independent of comorbidities that confound rather than mediate this effect. PLWH bear a disproportionate burden of alcohol, other drug use, mental health disorders, and other structural vulnerabilities, which may increase their risk of COVID-19. In addition to any direct effects of COVID-19 on the health of PLWH, we need to understand how physical distancing restrictions impact secondary health outcomes, and the need for, accessibility of, and impact of alternative modalities of providing ongoing medical, mental health, and substance use treatment that comply with physical distancing restrictions (e.g., telemedicine).",covid
"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a high contagiousness requiring isolation measures. At this time, diagnosis is based on the positivity of specific RT-PCR and/or chest computed tomography scan, which are time-consuming and may delay diagnosis. Complete blood count (CBC) can potentially contribute to the diagnosis of COVID-19. We studied whether the analysis of cellular population data (CPD), provided as part of CBC-Diff analysis by the DxH 800 analyzers (Beckman Coulter), can help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Cellular population data of the different leukocyte subpopulations were analyzed in 137 controls, 322 patients with proven COVID-19 (COVID+), and 285 patients for whom investigations were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-). When CPD of COVID+ were different from controls and COVID- patients, we used receiver operating characteristic analysis to test the discriminating capacity of the individual parameters. Using a random forest classifier, we developed the algorithm based on the combination of 4 monocyte CPD to discriminate COVID+ from COVID- patients. This algorithm was tested prospectively in a series of 222 patients referred to the emergency unit. Results: Among the 222 patients, 86 were diagnosed as COVID-19 and 60.5% were correctly identified using the discriminating protocol. Among the 136 COVID- patients, 10.3% were misclassified (specificity 89.7%, sensitivity 60.5%). False negatives were observed mainly in patients with a low inflammatory state whereas false positives were mainly seen in patients with sepsis. Conclusion: Consideration of CPD could constitute a first step and potentially aid in the early diagnosis of COVID-19.",covid
"SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread from China until it was defined a pandemic by WHO in March 2020. Related scientific papers have rapidly extended information regarding the diagnosis, treatment and epidemiology of COVID-19 infection. To date, no vaccine or definitive treatment is available to defeat the virus and therapies are mainly based on existing drugs used to treat other conditions. Existing therapies used in several clinical trials work by affecting the biology of COVID-19 and/or counteracting the harmful host excessive immune response. Here, we have reviewed 526 ongoing clinical trials for COVID-19 to provide a perspective on the first 6 months of global efforts to identify an effective therapy. The drugs most actively tested in various centers include hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir, azithromycin, tocilizumab, lopinavir chloroquine and ivermectin. Our analysis shows that most clinical trials focus on a small number of candidate drugs (namely hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine representing 25% of total clinical trials) while underestimating the potential of other promising drugs. A global coordination in clinical trial management could avoid duplications and increase the effectiveness of the response to the global challenge.",covid
"Purpose of review: To provide a summary of the neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), documented in the literature thus far. Recent findings: A small but growing literature documents cases of new onset neuro-ophthalmic disease, in the setting of COVID-19 infection. Patients with COVID-19 have experienced acute onset vision loss, optic neuritis, cranial neuropathies, and Miller Fisher syndrome. In addition, COVID-19 increases the risk of cerebrovascular diseases that can impact the visual system. Summary: The literature on COVID-19 continues to evolve. Although COVID-19 primarily impacts the respiratory system, there are several reports of new onset neuro-ophthalmic conditions in COVID-infected patients. When patients present with new onset neuro-ophthalmic issues, COVID-19 should be kept on the differential. Testing for COVID-19 should be considered, especially when fever or respiratory symptoms are also present. When screening general patients for COVID-19-associated symptoms, frontline physicians can consider including questions about diplopia, eye pain, pain with extraocular movements, decreased vision, gait issues, and other neurologic symptoms. The presence of these symptoms may increase the overall probability of viral infection, especially when fever or respiratory symptoms are present.

COVID-19 first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and by March 2020 COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. Case presentation: We describe a case of a 52-year-old female with past medical history of asthma, type 2 diabetes, and previous tobacco use who presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and was found to be positive for COVID-19. We discuss the computed tomographic finding of ""crazy-paving"" pattern in the patient's lungs and the significance of this finding in COVID-19 patients. Discussion: Emergency providers need to be aware of the different imaging characteristics of various stages of COVID-19 to appropriately treat, isolate, and determine disposition of COVID-19 infected patients. Ground-glass opacities are the earliest and most common imaging finding for COVID-19. Crazy-paving pattern is defined as thickened interlobular septa and intralobular lines superimposed on diffuse ground-glass opacities and should be recognized by emergency providers as a radiographic finding of progressive COVID-19.",covid
"Background New York City was the epicenter for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to characterize the population of patients admitted with this condition to a community hospital in East Harlem located in the northeast part of the city. Methods A retrospective review of medical records of patients at least 18 years of age, admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 disease from March 14 to April 30 of 2020. Results Three hundred and seventy-one patients were identified. The majority was comprised of men. Obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were the most prevalent comorbidities. Most patients were treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, zinc, and vitamin C. Twenty-three percent of the patients died from the disease during the study period. Conclusion Morbidity and mortality were substantial in patients with COVID-19 admitted to a community hospital in East Harlem.",covid
"Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major threat to nursing homes. During the COVID-19 pandemic wave that hit France in March and April 2020, staff members of some French nursing homes decided to confine themselves with their residents on a voluntary basis to reduce the risk of entry of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 into the facility. Objective: To investigate COVID-19-related outcomes in French nursing homes that implemented voluntary staff confinement with residents. Design, setting, and participants: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in French nursing homes from March 1 to May 11, 2020. Participants included residents and staff members of the nursing homes where staff participated in voluntary self-confinement as well as those of the facilities for elderly people where staff did not practice self-confinement. Rates of COVID-19 cases and mortality in the cohort of nursing homes with self confinement were compared with those derived from a population-based survey of nursing homes conducted by French health authorities. Exposures: Nursing homes with staff who self-confined were identified from the media and included if the confinement period of staff with residents was longer than 7 days. Main outcomes and measures: Mortality related to COVID-19 among residents and COVID-19 cases among residents and staff members. COVID-19 was diagnosed by primary care or hospital physicians on the basis of fever and respiratory signs (eg, cough, dyspnea) or a clinical illness compatible with COVID-19; COVID-19 diagnoses were considered confirmed if real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on nasopharyngeal swab was positive and considered possible if the test had not been performed or results were negative. Cases of COVID-19 were recorded by a telephone interview with the directors of nursing homes with staff who self-confined and by a nationwide declaration survey to health authorities for all facilities. Results: This study included 17 nursing homes in which 794 staff members confined themselves to the facility with their 1250 residents. The national survey included 9513 facilities with 385 290 staff members and 695 060 residents. Only 1 nursing home with staff who self-confined (5.8%) had cases of COVID-19 among residents, compared with 4599 facilities in the national survey (48.3%) (P < .001). Five residents (0.4%) in the nursing homes with staff who self-confined had confirmed COVID-19, compared with 30 569 residents (4.4%) with confirmed COVID-19 in the national survey (P < .001); no residents of facilities with self-confinement had possible COVID-19, compared with 31 799 residents (4.6%) with possible COVID-19 in the national survey (P < .001). Five residents (0.4%) in the nursing homes with staff who self-confined died of COVID-19, compared with 12 516 (1.8%) in the national survey (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.09-0.53; P < .001). Twelve staff members (1.6%) from the facilties with self-confinement had confirmed or possible COVID-19, compared with 29 463 staff members (7.6%) in the national survey (P < .001). Conclusions and relevance: In this cohort study of French nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality rates related to COVID-19 were lower among nursing homes that implemented staff confinement with residents compared with those in a national survey. These findings suggest that self-confinement of staff members with residents may help protect nursing home residents from mortality related to COVID-19 and residents and staff from COVID-19 infection.",covid
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly affected all specialty practices in medicine, including the field of spinal surgery. Spinal surgery is unique in that the procedures include not only fully elective and fully emergent interventions, but also involve a separate group of semi-emergent surgeries, where delayed intervention may lead to permanent neurological deficits. Here, we present an evidence-based review on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on spinal surgery and our current knowledge about this issue. We conducted a thorough search of the PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases using the keywords, ""COVID-19,"" ""COVID-19 impact on spine surgery,"" ""coronavirus impact on spine surgery,"" ""COVID-19 impact on neurosurgery,"" ""coronavirus impact on neurosurgery,"" ""COVID-19 impact on spine surgeons,"" and ""coronavirus impact on spine surgeons"" on May 6, 2020. A total of 8,322 articles were identified in the initial search. Articles that were duplicated, those that did not pertain to COVID-19 or spine surgeries, those with details not pertaining to the current topic of interest, and those published in languages other than English were excluded from our analyses. After complete screening, six articles were included in this review. During the previous few weeks, the COVID pandemic has significantly influenced all major aspects of spine surgery across the world. Outpatient care has been gradually shifted from physical visits to tele-health and online consultations. General recommendations have favored the conservative approach over surgeries, although no patient should be deprived of standard care owing to concerns about COVID. The general principles followed by spine surgeons should include early detection of COVID symptomatology; triaging of patients based on underlying spinal pathology; prescription of appropriate investigations to confirm the COVID status; isolation, as needed; selection of optimal management method as per the guidelines; adherence to best intraoperative practices; and ensuring protective measures for non-infected patients, family members, fellow heath care providers, and themselves against the disease.",covid
"Background: Diabetes is recognized as an important comorbidity in patients with COVID-19 and a large amount of literature has become available regarding this. The aim of this article is to review the literature regarding various aspects of association between diabetes and COVID-19 and to highlight clinically relevant points with focus on India. Methods: We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar databases for articles regarding diabetes and COVID-19 published between March 19, 2020 and August 30, 2020. Results: Diabetes and poor glycemic control are associated with increased severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Several clinical scenarios about hyperglycemia and COVID-19 are identified and each of these needs specific management strategies. Conclusion: It is prudent to maintain good glycemic control in patients with diabetes in order to minimize the complications of COVID-19. There is a need for well conducted studies to asses the role of individual antihyperglycemic therapies in COVID-19 and also the behavior of new onset diabetes diagnosed either after COVID-19 infection or during this time.",covid
"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of infection with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and can also amplify outbreaks within healthcare facilities if they become ill. Certain groups are known to be at higher risk of contracting severe COVID-19 infection, such as men and people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. Identifying and managing HCWs who have been exposed to COVID-19 is of utmost importance in preventing healthcare transmission and protecting staff and vulnerable patients in healthcare settings. Recently, antibody testing to diagnose previous COVID-19 exposure among HCW has commenced in the UK. This provided an opportunity to assess exposure to COVID-19 among the various subgroups within the HCW community, based on their roles and ethnic background. We found that HCWs working in patient-facing roles were twice as likely to have been exposed to COVID-19 than their colleagues in non-patient-facing roles. Reassuringly, workers from BAME backgrounds had a similar risk of previous COVID-19 exposure to their white colleagues. More research is required to assess how frontline staff, especially those working in patient facing roles, can reduce their risk of exposure to COVID-19.",covid
"Background: Frailty and multimorbidity have been suggested as risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. Aims: We investigated, in the UK Biobank, whether frailty and multimorbidity were associated with risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19. Methods: 502,640 participants aged 40-69 years at baseline (54-79 years at COVID-19 testing) were recruited across UK during 2006-10. A modified assessment of frailty using Fried's classification was generated from baseline data. COVID-19 test results (England) were available for 16/03/2020-01/06/2020, mostly taken in hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to discern associations between frailty, multimorbidity and COVID-19 diagnoses, after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking and number of comorbidity groupings, comparing COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. Results: 4510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive = 1326, negative = 3184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR = 1.4 [95%CI = 1.1, 1.8]), report slow walking speed (OR = 1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR = 1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid (≥ 4 comorbidity groupings vs 0-1: OR = 1.9 [1.5, 2.3]). However, similar strength of associations were apparent when comparing COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. However, frailty and multimorbidity were not associated with COVID-19 diagnoses, when comparing COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants. Discussion and conclusions: Frailty and multimorbidity do not appear to aid risk stratification, in terms of positive versus negative results of COVID-19 testing. Investigation of the prognostic value of these markers for adverse clinical sequelae following COVID-19 disease is urgently needed.",covid
"Background: Patient-facing digital-health tools have been promoted for managing COVID-19 related concerns, and for remote and self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has also been suggested these tools may help further our understanding of the clinical characteristics of this new disease. However, there is limited information on the characteristics and patterns of use of these tools in practice. Objective: To describe the characteristics of people using digital-health tools for COVID-19, explore self-reported symptoms and characterize those associated with COVID-19, and characterize the recommendations provided by digital-health tools. Methods: This study used data from three digital health tools on the K-health app: a protocol based COVID-19 self-assessment, an AI-driven symptom checker, and communication with remote physicians. Deidentified data were extracted on demographic and clinical characteristics of adults seeking COVID-19 related health information between April 8th and June 20th, 2020. Analyses included exploring features associated with COVID-19 positivity, and features associated with the use of choosing to communicate with a remote physician. Results: During the period assessed, 71,619 individuals completed the COVID-19 self-assessment, 41,425 also used the AI-driven symptom checker, and 2,485 consulted with remote physicians. Individuals using the COVID-19 self-assessment were predominantly female (72.4%), with a mean age of 34.5 (±13.9) years. Testing for COVID-19 was reported by 2,901 users, of whom 433 (14.9%) reported testing positive. COVID-19 positive users were more likely to have reported loss of smell or taste (RR 6.66, 95% CI 5.53-7.94) and other established COVID-19 symptoms, as well as ocular symptoms. Users communicating with a remote physician were more likely to have been recommended to refer to immediate medical evaluation by the self-assessment due to the presence of severe symptoms (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02-1.32). Most consultations with remote physicians (76.9%) were resolved without need for referral to an in-person visit or to the emergency room. Conclusions: These results suggest that digital-health tools can help support remote- and self-management of COVID-19, and that self-reported symptoms from digital interactions can extend our understanding of symptoms associated with COVID-19.",covid
"Objective: The illness resulting from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), better known as COVID-19, has quickly escalated to a worldwide pandemic. Although understanding of the short and long-term manifestations of COVID-19 remains incomplete, there is a preponderance of respiratory pathology in COVID-19 and potential for chronic loss of pulmonary function in recovered patients, raising concerns for associated cognitive impacts. Method: We conducted a narrative review of the existing literature on neuropsychological variables in acute/severe respiratory disease and various forms of chronic pulmonary disease to inform expectations about potential cognitive manifestations of COVID-19. Results: Cognitive dysfunction is common but not inevitable in acute and chronic pulmonary disease, although unique predictors and symptom trajectories appear to be associated with each. Conclusions: Although the full scope of neuropathophysiology associated with COVID-19 remains to be established, pulmonary insults associated with the disease are likely to produce cognitive dysfunction in a substantial percentage of patients.",covid
"There are limited data about the coexistence of asthma and the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic is a new disease for the whole world. In this study, we aimed to examine the published case series with the COVID-19 and asthma coexistence, by reviewing existing studies and other publications. We discussed the suggestions of guidelines such as The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and the Canadian Respiratory Guideline about the management of asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic and the experiences of different countries. We analyzed the publications, reports, and expert opinions about asthma and COVID-19, that were released and expressed from the onset of the disease in Wuhan. In this review, we aimed to summarize the approach to patients with asthma during the pandemic and to make recommendations concerning it.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic. COVID-19 leads to a plethora of clinical syndromes, most commonly affecting the pulmonary system but also the cardiovascular, hematologic, and gastrointestinal systems. There is emerging evidence of an association between COVID-19 and venous thromboembolism (VTE). In this report, we have discussed three cases with a COVID-19 infection, whose clinical course was complicated by the presence of pulmonary embolism (PE) without evident risk factors for VTE. All three patients presented with hypoxia and were found to have elevated D-dimer levels. Subsequently, the patients underwent computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest, which confirmed the presence of pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation was initiated per guidelines. There is a need to have a low threshold for suspecting pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19 infection who present with a sudden onset of severe hypoxia. There is a dire need to increase awareness among health care providers regarding this manifestation of the virus.",covid
"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause mild, moderate or severe disease (COVID-19). In severe disease, there is hyperinflammation causing severe symptoms. Severe COVID-19 is an immunological phenomenon, rather than a direct viral damage disease. Therapies for COVID-19 are all investigational therapies. In case of severe disease, treatment with a calcineurin inhibitor could be promising. In this article we explain the mechanisms of calcineurin inhibitor treatment for COVID-19, based on experiences seen in solid organ transplant recipients who suffered from COVID-19.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a serious global threat causing a large number of fatalities and putting enormous strain on the health care resources across the world. This has resulted in preferentially triaging the coronavirus infected patients and placing others, especially cardiovascular patients at increased risk for adverse complications. The effective management of cardiac patients in the hospital environment during this COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a real challenge. We try to address this issue and also highlight the interplay between COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases. We hereby review the available literature and emerging guidelines about cardiovascular implications related to COVID-19 which will have a bearing on the patient care, health care professionals and cardiac centres.",covid
"On January 9 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the identification, by Chinese Health authorities, of a novel coronavirus, further classified as SARS-CoV-2 responsible of a disease (COVID-19) ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe respiratory involvement. On March 9 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Italy is the second most affected country by COVID-19 infection after China. The ""L. Spallanzani"" National Institute for the Infectious Diseases, IRCCS, Rome, Italy, has been the first Italian hospital to admit and manage patients affected by COVID-19. Hereby, we show our recommendations for the management of COVID-19 patients, based on very limited clinical evidences; they should be considered as expert opinions, which may be modified according to newly produced literature data.",covid
"In this Update, we document the circulation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Florida, USA, since February 2020. On 8th March 2020, a confirmed case of COVID-19 was notified to the Health Authority of Central Tuscany, Florence, Italy. The patient developed symptoms on 3rd March while staying in Miami where he arrived on 12th February. The case returned to Italy on 6th March and was admitted to a local hospital of Florence on 7th March with fever (38.2°C/100.4°F), cough and breathing difficulties. First COVID-19 cases in Florida where confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 2nd March as imported cases. Therefore, this event documents COVID-19 circulation in Florida at least since mid-February 2020.",covid
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been established as a cause of severe alveolar damage and pneumonia in patients with advanced Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The consolidation of lung parenchyma precipitates the alterations in blood gases in COVID-19 patients that are known to complicate and cause hypoxemic respiratory failure. With SARS-CoV-2 damaging multiple organs in COVID-19, including the central nervous system that regulates the breathing process, it is a daunting task to compute the extent to which the failure of the central regulation of the breathing process contributes to the mortality of COVID-19 affected patients. Emerging data on COVID-19 cases from hospitals and autopsies in the last few months have helped in the understanding of the pathogenesis of respiratory failures in COVID-19. Recent reports have provided overwhelming evidence of the occurrence of acute respiratory failures in COVID-19 due to neurotropism of the brainstem by SARS-CoV-2. In this review, a cascade of events that may follow the alterations in blood gases and possible neurological damage to the respiratory regulation centers in the central nervous system (CNS) in COVID-19 are related to the basic mechanism of respiratory regulation in order to understand the acute respiratory failure reported in this disease. Though a complex metabolic and respiratory dysregulation also occurs with infections caused by SARS-CoV-1 and MERS that are known to contribute toward deaths of the patients in the past, we highlight here the role of systemic dysregulation and the CNS respiratory regulation mechanisms in the causation of mortalities seen in COVID-19. The invasion of the CNS by SARS-CoV-2, as shown recently in areas like the brainstem that control the normal breathing process with nuclei like the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BÖTC), may explain why some of the patients with COVID-19, who have been reported to have recovered from pneumonia, could not be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation and the occurrences of acute respiratory arrests seen in COVID-19. This debate is important for many reasons, one of which is the fact that permanent damage to the medullary respiratory centers by SARS-CoV-2 would not benefit from mechanical ventilators, as is possibly occurring during the management of COVID-19 patients.",covid
"Sumac is an herbal product, commonly consumed as a spice and was used for medical treatment for centuries. The phytochemical structure of Sumac was studied extensively, and it was established that the herb contained tannins, polyphenols, flavonoids, organic acids, and essential oils. Various scientific studies demonstrated that Sumac had a free oxygen radical-scavenging effect, a protective effect against liver damage, antihemolytic, leukopenia, and antifibrogenic effects, along with its antiviral, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Recently, several scientific studies described the pathophysiology, clinical course, and the treatment of COVID-19 infection. The examination of the characteristics of COVID-19 infection revealed via the clinical studies suggests that Sumac extract could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19. Given the scientific studies focusing on the beneficial effects of Sumac, the present review aims to provide an encouraging viewpoint to investigate whether Sumac is effective in treating COVID-19 infection.",covid
"The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 poses an unprecedented global health challenge. With its variety of clinical manifestations including, but not limited to, fever, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fatigue, it may be challenging to distinguish COVID-19 from a spectrum of diseases with similar presentations, such as malaria, especially in endemic areas. Risk of concomitant infections also remains a concern owing to overburdening of healthcare services and possible scarcity of resources. We present the first reported case of confirmed COVID and malaria co-infection. In this case, we emphasize the need for vigilance from frontline clinicians for timely diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of potential co-infections in the COVID era.",covid
"We describe an overweight COVID-19 patient with respiratory distress preceded by anosmia/dysgeusia with no lung injury shown on CT, angio-CT or ventilation/perfusion scans. Orthopnoea and paradoxical abdominal respiration were identified. Phrenic paralysis, demonstrated by examination of patient breathing, and on x-ray while standing breathing in and out, explained the respiratory distress. This is a rare and previously undescribed neurological complication of COVID-19 infection caused by vagus nerve injury. Learning points: Phrenic paralysis must be kept in mind as a rare neurological complication of COVID-19.Vagus nerve palsy is a neurological manifestation as anosmia and dysgeusia, that were already identified in the olfactory system of COVID-19 patients.",covid
"We report a case of acute viral pericarditis and cardiac tamponade in a patient with COVID-19 to highlight the associated treatment challenges, especially given the uncertainty associated with the safety of standard treatment. We also discuss complications associated with delayed diagnosis in patients who potentially may need mechanical ventilation. Learning points: Large pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade should be considered in patients with COVID-19 who decompensate further after intubation and mechanical ventilation.The characteristics of pericardial effusion in patients with COVID-19 are described.A successful treatment approach for acute pericarditis in a patient with COVID-19 in light of differing opinions over the safety of NSAID use is described.",covid
"COVID-19 threatens millions of lives, especially elderly population and people with chronic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.

"The purpose of this article is to describe arterial and venous thromboembolism in the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Eighty-two patients with COVID-19 who underwent abdominal ultrasound or CT were retrospectively compared with 82 patients without COVID-19 for thromboembolism and solid-organ infarction. Nine (11%) patients with COVID-19 had thromboembolic findings, with medium to large arterial thrombi in five. One patient without COVID-19 had known portal vein thrombus on CT. Thromboembolic findings occurred more frequently in patients with than without COVID-19 (p = 0.02).",covid
"The novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread and poses a great challenge to researchers, both in elucidating its pathogenic mechanism and developing effective treatments. It has been recently proposed that COVID-19 is an endothelial disease. Indeed, the COVID-19 virus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in endothelial cells. ACE2 could be implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by endothelial dysfunction due to viral damage. Consequently, oxidative stress could prime these cells to acquire a pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory phenotype, predisposing patients to thromboembolic and vasculitic events and to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). This implies a pivotal role played by oxygen in the pathogenetic mechanism of COVID-19 disease, in that its availability would tune the oxidant state and consequent damage.",covid
"Objective: SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious and spreads rapidly. The application of preventive measures has proven to be the best strategy to minimize the number of patients and the dissemination of and deaths from COVID-19. The objective of this study was to determine the risk factors that limit the adherence of asthmatic patients to measures that prevent COVID-19 among residents of a region with a high risk of a COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: Through a cross-sectional study, data from 2,372 participants aged 16-24 years were analyzed. To collect their information, a questionnaire was constructed using the Google Forms tool. Due to the prevention measures in place for COVID-19, the home quarantine of many people, and the lack of socialization, the questionnaire was distributed through email (Internet) and WhatsApp. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the variables. Results: The prevalence of asthma was 12.2%, and non-adherence to the guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19 was 53.1%. Approximately 30.8% of asthma patients did not comply with the basic prevention measures for COVID-19. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that being male, active smoking, and believing that COVID-19 is not a more severe disease for people suffering from asthma than others were associated with non-adherence to the basic protection measures established in the guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19. Conclusions: It is important for health professionals to advise asthma patients to comply with the basic measures of protection against COVID-19 and timely use medications for asthma control.",covid
"Background: Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, is a tertiary hospital located in the center of Israel. It is the largest hospital in Israel and was the first to face coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients in the country at the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Objectives: To describe our experience with the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on our triage method in the emergency department (ED). Our goal was to keep the main hospitalization buildings clean of infection by separating COVID-19 positive patients from COVID-19 negative patients. Methods: We divided our ED into two separate sections: a regular non-COVID-19 ED and an advanced biological ED. We created clear protocols of triage for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. We reviewed the data of patients admitted to our ED during the month of March and analyzed the results of our triage method in separating COVID-19 positive from negative patients. Results: During the month of March 2020, 7957 patients were referred to our ED. Among them 2004 were referred to the biological ED and 5953 were referred to the regular ED. Of the 2004 patients referred to the biological ED, 1641 (81.8%) were sampled for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction of whom 143 (8.7%) were positive. Only two COVID-19 positive patients unintentionally entered the main clean hospital, making our triage almost full proof. Conclusions: Our triage method was successful in separating COVID-19 positive from negative patients and maintained the regular hospital clean of COVID-19 allowing treatment continuation of regular non-COVID-19 patients.",covid
"Objectives: During the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the United States, nursing homes became the hotbed for the spread of COVID-19. States developed different policies to mitigate the COVID-19 risks at nursing homes, including limiting nursing home visitation and mandating staff screening. The purpose of this study is to examine whether COVID-19 cases and deaths are related to the nursing home reported quality. Design: We combined the COVID-19 data reported by the California Department of Public Health, quality ratings provided by Nursing Home Compare, and patient racial information from Long-Term Care Focus to examine the association between nursing home reported quality and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Settings and participants: Cross-sectional data from 1223 California skilled nursing facilities with reported quality and longitudinal data of COVID-19 cases were used. Methods: The dependent variable is COVID-19 residents' cases and deaths. The main independent variable is nursing home reported quality. Nursing home ownership, size, years of operation, and patient race composition are also included. Results: Nursing home star ratings and greater percentage of residents from different racial and ethnicity groups were significantly (P < .01) related to increased probability of having a COVID-19 residents' case or death. Conclusions and implications: Nursing homes with 5-star ratings were less likely to have COVID-19 cases and deaths after adjusting for nursing home size and patient race proportion.",covid
"Introduction: COVID-19 is the disease caused by an infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first identified in the city of Wuhan, in China's Hubei province in December 2019. COVID-19 was previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) respiratory disease before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the official name as COVID-19 in February 2020. Aim: The aim of this study is to search scientific literature in the biomedicine and analyzed current results of investigations regarding morbidity and mortality rates as consequences of COVID-19 infection of Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and other most common chronic diseases which are on the top mortality and morbidity rates in almost all countries in the world. Also, to propose most useful measures how to prevent patients to keep themselves against COVID-19 infection. Methods: We used method of descriptive analysis of the published papers with described studies about Corona virus connected with CVD, and, also, Guidelines proposed by World Health Organization (WHO) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and some other international associations which are included in global fighting against COVID-19 infection. Results: After searching current scientific literature we have acknowledged that not any Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) study in the world during last 5 months from the time when first cases of COVID-10 infection was detected. Also, there is no unique proposed ways of treatments and drugs to protect patients, especially people over 65 years old, who are very risk group to be affected with COVID-19. Expectations that vaccine against COVID-19 will be produced optimal during at least 10 months to 2 years, and in all current Guidelines most important proposed preventive measures are the same like which one described in Strategic documents of WHO, in statements of Declaration of Primary Health Care in Alma Ata in 1978. Conclusion: WHO proposed preventive measures can be helpful to everybody. Physicians who work at every level of Health Care Systems, but especially at primary health care level, must follow those recommendations and teach their patients about it. But, the fact is that current focus of COVID-19 epidemic has targeted on protection of physical health of population in global, however, the influence on mental health which will be one of the important consequences of COVID-19 pandemic in the future, and which could be declared as «Post-coronavirus Stress Syndrome"" (PCSS) could be bigger challenge for Global Public Health.",covid
"The emerging infection of COVID-19 was initiated from Wuhan, China, have been spread to more than 210 countries around the globe including India. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to other respiratory viruses. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases and associated deaths are increasing regularly in various parts of the World. Seven coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS and, COVID-19) can naturally infect human beings. Out of these four (229E-CoV, NL63-CoV, OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV) are responsible for mild upper respiratory infections, while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 are well known for their high mortality. Few mild strains of coronaviruses are circulating in India but there is no evidence of SARS and MERS outbreaks. The COVID-19 is an emerging viral infection responsible for pandemics. Fortunately, the mortality of COVID-19 is low as compared with SARS and MERS, the majority of its cases are recovered. The death toll of COVID-19 is high even after its low mortality because COVID-19 causes a pandemic while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause epidemics only. COVID-19 influenced the large segments of the world population, which led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert. COVID-19 is the first coronavirus after Spanish Flu 1918-1919, who has extremely influenced the health system, economy, and psychology of India. The present study review is on the general continent, virology, pathogenesis, global epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and control of COVID-19 with the reference to India.",covid
"Background: The presentation of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) overlaps with common influenza symptoms. There is limited data on whether a specific symptom or collection of symptoms may be useful to predict test positivity. Methods: An anonymous electronic survey was publicized through social media to query participants with COVID-19 testing. Respondents were questioned regarding 10 presenting symptoms, demographic information, comorbidities, and COVID-19 test results. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors for COVID-19 positivity. Selected classifiers were assessed for prediction performance using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: A total of 145 participants with positive COVID-19 testing and 157 with negative results were included. Participants had a mean age of 39 years, and 214 (72%) were female. Smell or taste change, fever, and body ache were associated with COVID-19 positivity, and shortness of breath and sore throat were associated with a negative test result (p < 0.05). A model using all 5 diagnostic symptoms had the highest accuracy with a predictive ability of 82% in discriminating between COVID-19 results. To maximize sensitivity and maintain fair diagnostic accuracy, a combination of 2 symptoms, change in sense of smell or taste and fever was found to have a sensitivity of 70% and overall discrimination accuracy of 75%. Conclusion: Smell or taste change is a strong predictor for a COVID-19-positive test result. Using the presence of smell or taste change with fever, this parsimonious classifier correctly predicts 75% of COVID-19 test results. A larger cohort of respondents will be necessary to refine classifier performance.",covid
"Purpose: COVID-19 is a novel threat to patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI), whose life expectancy and quality (QoL) are impaired by an increased risk of infections and stress-triggered adrenal crises (AC). If infected, AI patients require prompt replacement tailoring. We assessed, in a cohort of AI patients: prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19; prevalence of AC and association with intercurrent COVID-19 or pandemic-related psychophysical stress; lockdown-induced emotional burden, and health-related QoL. Methods: In this monocentric (Ancona University Hospital, Italy), cross-sectional study covering February-April 2020, 121 (40 primary, 81 secondary) AI patients (59 males, 55 ± 17 years) completed telematically three questionnaires: the purpose-built ""CORTI-COVID"", assessing medical history and concern for COVID-19-related global health, AI-specific personal health, occupational, economic, and social consequences; the AddiQoL-30; the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey. Results: COVID-19 occurred in one (0·8% prevalence) 48-year-old woman with primary AI, who promptly tailored her replacement. Dyspnea lasted three days, without requiring hospitalization. Secondary AI patients were not involved. No AC were experienced, but pandemic-related stress accounted for 6/14 glucocorticoid up-titrations. Mean CORTI-COVID was similar between groups, mainly depending on ""personal health"" in primary AI (ρ = 0.888, p < 0.0001) and ""economy"" in secondary AI (ρ = 0.854, p < 0.0001). Working restrictions increased occupational concern. CORTI-COVID correlated inversely with QoL. AddiQoL-30 and SF-36 correlated strongly. Comorbidities worsened patients' QoL. Conclusion: If educational efforts are made in preventing acute events, AI patients seem not particularly susceptible to COVID-19. The novel ""CORTI-COVID"" questionnaire reliably assesses the pandemic-related emotional burden in AI. Even under unconventional stress, educated AI patients preserve a good QoL.",covid
"While there is evidence of variations in the risk perceptions of COVID-19 and that they are linked to both engagement in health-protective behaviors and poor mental health outcomes, there has been a lack of attention to how individuals perceive the risk of COVID-19 relative to other infectious diseases. This paper examines the relative perceptions of the severity of COVID-19 and HIV among a sample of U.S. gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSMs). The ""Love and Sex in the Time of COVID-19"" survey was conducted online from April 2020 to May 2020. GBMSMs were recruited through paid banner advertisements featured on social networking platforms, resulting in a sample size of 696. The analysis considers differences in responses to two scales: the Perceived Severity of HIV Infection and the Perceived Severity of COVID-19 Infection. Participants perceived greater seriousness for HIV infection (mean 46.67, range 17-65) than for COVID-19 infection (mean 38.81, range 13-62). Some items reflecting more proximal impacts of infection (anxiety, loss of sleep, and impact on employment) were similar for HIV and COVID-19. Those aged over 25 and those who perceived higher prevalence of COVID-19 in the United States or their state were more likely to report COVID-19 as more severe than HIV. There is a need to develop nuanced public health messages for GBMSMs that convey the ongoing simultaneous health threats of both HIV and COVID-19.",covid
"Introduction: Pulmonary opacities in COVID-19 increase throughout the illness and peak after ten days. The radiological literature mainly focuses on CT findings. The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of chest radiographs (CXR) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at presentation. Methods: We retrospectively identified consecutive reverse transcription polymerase reaction-confirmed COVID-19 patients (n = 104, 75% men) and patients (n = 75, 51% men) with repeated negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests. Two radiologists blindly and independently reviewed the CXRs, documented findings, assigned radiographic assessment of lung edema (RALE) scores, and predicted the patients' COVID-19 status. We calculated interobserver reliability. The score use for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: The overall RALE score failed to identify COVID-19 patients at presentation. However, the score was inversely correlated with a COVID-19 diagnosis within ≤2 days, and a positive correlation was found six days after symptom onset.Interobserver agreement with regard to separating normal from abnormal CXRs was moderate (k = 0.408) with low specificity (25% and 27%). Definite pleural effusion had almost perfect agreement (k = 0.833) and substantially reduced the odds of a COVID-19 diagnosis. Disease distribution and experts' opinion on COVID-19 status had only fair interobserver agreement. The RALE score interobserver reliability was moderate to good (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.745). A high RALE score predicted a poor outcome (intensive care unit hospitalization, intubation, or death) in COVID-19 patients; a score of ≥5 substantially increased the odds of having a poor outcome. Conclusion: Chest radiography was found not to be a valid diagnostic tool for COVID-19, as normal or near-normal CXRs are more likely early in the disease course. Pleural effusions at presentation suggest a diagnosis other than COVID-19. More extensive lung opacities at presentation are associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 patients. Thus, patients with more than minimal opacities should be monitored closely for clinical deterioration. This clinical application of CXR is its greatest strength in COVID-19 as it impacts patient care.",covid
"Background/aim: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak is currently having a huge impact on medical resource allocation. Breast Cancer (BC) patients are concerned both with BC treatment and COVID-19. This study aimed to estimate the impact of anxiety among patients, caused by the spreading of COVID-19. Patients and methods: Between the 16th of January and the 20th of March 2020, we retrospectively enrolled 160 patients. Eighty-two patients with a suspected breast lesion (SBL) were divided into two groups: PRE-COVID-19-SBL and POST-COVID-19-SBL. Seventy-eight BC patients were divided into PRE-COVID-19-BC and POST-COVID-19-BC. Patient characteristics including age, marital status, SBL/BC diameter, personal and family history of BC, clinical stage and molecular subtype were recorded. Procedure Refusal (PR) and Surgical Refusal (SR) were also recorded with their reason. Results: BC and SBL analysis showed no difference in pre-treatment characteristics (p>0.05). Both POST-COVID-19-SBL and POST-COVID-19-BC groups showed higher rates of PR and SR (p=0.0208, p=0.0065 respectively). Infection risk represented primary reason for refusal among POST-COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: COVID-19-related anxiety could affect patients' decision-making process.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to frequent referrals to the emergency department on suspicion of this infection in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and kidney transplant (KT) patients. We aimed to describe their clinical features comparing confirmed and suspected non-confirmed COVID-19 cases during the Spanish epidemic peak. Confirmed COVID-19 ((+)COVID-19) corresponds to patient with positive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 assay. Non-confirmed COVID-19 ((-)COVID-19) corresponds to patients with negative RT-PCR. COVID-19 was suspected in 61 patients (40/803 KT (4.9%), 21/220 MHD (9.5%)). Prevalence of (+)COVID-19 was 3.2% in KT and 3.6% in MHD patients. Thirty-four (26 KT and 8 MHD) were (+)COVID-19 and 27 (14 KT and 13 MHD) (-)COVID-19. In comparison with (-)COVID-19 patients, (+)COVID-19 showed higher frequency of typical viral symptoms (cough, dyspnea, asthenia and myalgias), pneumonia (88.2% vs. 14.3%) and LDH and CRP while lower phosphate levels, need of hospital admission (100% vs. 63%), use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (36% vs. 11%) and mortality (38% vs. 0%) (p < 0.001). Time from symptoms onset to admission was longer in patients who finally died than in survivors (8.5 vs. 3.8, p = 0.007). In KT and MHD patients, (+)COVID-19 shows more clinical severity than suspected non-confirmed cases. Prompt RT-PCR is mandatory to confirm COVID-19 diagnosis.",covid
"COVID-19 diseases have been a nationwide pandemic condition. However, cutaneous, skin histopathological manifestations of COVID-19 infection are not well described. Our study aims are to present heterogeneous cutaneous, histopathological manifestations in COVID-19 patients, to investigate the possible relationship between cutaneous manifestations and histopathological features in COVID-19 infection. We performed a systemic review in PubMed database and Chinese medical journal search engines which were wangfang.data (http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/), Science China (http://www.cnki.net/) until June 17th, 2020. Search terms ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS-Coronavirus-2"" and ""Coronavirus"" were used in combination with ""cutaneous,"" ""rash,"" ""skin,"" ""dermatology."" Seventy-five papers were included with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The most frequent cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 present was erythema, nearly 38.4%. Trunk was the most affected location, presenting in 51.4% patients. Rash occurred before onset of other symptoms was in 5.3% patients. Seventy-seven patients were received treatments. Rash was dismissed in 49% patients, improved in 21.2% patients ranged from 0 to 17 days. The histopathological examination present in 39 patients. Skin is one of target organs affected by COVID-19 infection. Cutaneous manifestations should be paid more attention. It can help doctors diagnose COVID-19 infection in prodromal stage, understand progression, and determine prognosis of COVID-19 infection.",covid
"Background/Aims Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global challenge due to little available knowledge and treatment protocols. Thus, there is a great need for collecting data related to COVID-19 from all around the world. Hence, we conducted this study, collecting daily data on COVID-19, to map the epidemiology outbreak and forecast its trajectory for May 2020. Methodology The data was collected from the officially released reports of the National Institute of Health (NIH), Pakistan, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), and forecasting was done using a simple moving average in time series modeler/expert modeler. Results The purpose of this study is to draw the attention of international, as well as national, governing bodies to the rapidly rising number of COVID-19 cases in Pakistan, and the urgency of evaluating the efficacy of the currently implemented strategy against COVID-19. According to this study, there is now an alarming increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in Pakistan, despite a contained spread in the beginning. The predicted number of COVID-19 cases can go over 35,000 by the end of May 2020. Conclusion It is crucial for governing bodies, administrators, and researchers to re-evaluate the current situation, designed policies, and implemented strategies.",covid
"Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a global health threat with significant medical, economic, social and political implications. The optimal strategies for combating COVID-19 have not been fully determined and vary across countries. Methods: By the end of February 2020 in Taiwan, 2,150 patients received diagnostic COVID-19 testing and 39 confirmed cases were detected. This is a relatively lower rate of infection compared to other Asian countries. In this article, we summarize the epidemiological characteristics of the 39 infected patients as well as public and hospital responses to COVID-19. Results: Thirty-nine COVID-19 cases and one death have been confirmed in Taiwan. Seventeen of these patients were infected by family members or in hospital wards, emphasizing how COVID-19 is mostly spread by close contact. We examined how hospital have responded to COVID-19, including their implementation of patient route control, outdoor clinics, hospital visit restrictions and ward and staff modifications. We also studied the public's use of face masks in response to COVID-19. These strategies may reduce the spread of COVID-19 in other countries. Conclusion: The emergence and spread of COVID-19 is a threat to health worldwide. Taiwan has reported lower infected cases and its strategies may contribute to further disease prevention and control.",covid

"With a large international sample (n = 8317), the present study examined which beliefs and attitudes about COVID-19 predict 1) following government recommendations, 2) taking health precautions (including mask wearing, social distancing, handwashing, and staying at home), and 3) encouraging others to take health precautions. The results demonstrate the importance of believing that taking health precautions will be effective for avoiding COVID-19 and generally prioritizing one's health. These beliefs continued to be important predictors of health behaviors after controlling for demographic and personality variables. In contrast, we found that perceiving oneself as vulnerable to COVID-19, the perceived severity of catching COVID-19, and trust in government were of relatively little importance. We also found that women were somewhat more likely to engage in these health behaviors than men, but that age was generally unrelated to voluntary compliance behaviors. These findings may suggest avenues and dead ends for behavioral interventions during COVID-19 and beyond.",covid
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the risk factors associated with severe illness in COVID-19 leading to increased hospital admissions and mortality. COVID-19 can precipitate hyperglycemic emergencies like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) in patients with DM. We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital with combined DKA and HHS. The case highlights the challenge of managing patients with DM suffering from COVID-19.,covid
"This paper describes the potential impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the readymade garment (RMG) workers of Bangladesh. It articulates the RMG workers' existing vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic based on currently available evidence and personal conversations/communications with RMG workers. COVID-19 has already impacted RMG workers' health (both physical and mental health status) and wellbeing, and resulted in loss of employment. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic will have long-lasting effects on the garment workers, especially related to their health issues, financial hardship and inability to pay for essentials such as food, and future employment opportunities. The stakeholders (such as the international retailers/brands, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Government of Bangladesh) responsible for the global supply chain RMG factories should reconsider the health and overall wellbeing needs of the RMG workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Objective: We aimed to detect the malignant arrhythmic potential of COVID-19 with surface electrocardiographic (ECG) markers.Material and method: Of the ECG parameters PR, QT, QTc, QTd, TPe, and Tpe/QTc were measured in 51 COVID-19 patients and 40 in control subjects.Results: Compared to control group mean QTc (410.8 ± 24.3 msec vs. 394.6 ± 20.3 msec, p < .001) and Tpe/QTc (0.19 ± 0.02 vs. 0.18 ± 0.04, p = .036) and median QTd (47.52 vs. 46.5) values were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients. Troponin levels were significantly correlated with heart rate (r = 0.387, p = .006) but not with ECG parameters.Conclusion: Several ventricular arrhythmia surface ECG predictors including QTc, QTd, and Tpe/QTc are increased in COVID-19 patients. Since medications used in COVID-19 patients have the potential to affect these parameters, giving importance to these ECG markers may have a significant contribution in decreasing disease-related arrhythmias.",covid

"Objective: This study aimed to assess cancer patients' psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic by investigating distress (distress-thermometer), health status (EQ-5D-3L), general anxiety (GAD-7), COVID-19-related fear and associated behavioral changes and comparing these to matched healthy controls, using propensity score matching (PSM). Methods: During the first days of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, March 16 to 30, 2020, 150 actually treated cancer patients and 150 matched healthy controls participated in this study. Participants completed an anonymous online survey assessing health status, distress, general anxiety, COVID-19-related fear and behavioral changes (i.e., adherent safety behavior and dysfunctional safety behavior). Results: Cancer patients showed no elevated level of distress, U = 10,657.5, p = 0.428, general anxiety U = 10,015.5, p = 0.099, or COVID-19-related fear compared to healthy controls, U = 10,948, p = 0.680. Both groups showed elevated COVID-19-related fear. Cancer patients reported more adherent safety behavior, such as washing hands more often or avoiding public places, U = 8,285, p < 0.001, d = 0.468. They also reported more dysfunctional safety behavior such as buying larger quantities of basic food, compared to healthy controls U = 9,599, p = 0.029, d = 0.256. Adherent safety behavior could be significantly explained by cancer diagnosis, increased COVID-19-related fear and subjective level of information about COVID-19, R 2 = 0.215, F(3) = 27.026, p < 0.001. Conclusion: This suggests that cancer patients are more likely to utilize adherent safety behavior. Cancer patients reported comparable levels of distress and anxiety compared to healthy controls. Still, the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with elevated COVID-19-related fear. Therefore, specific interventions are needed to prevent anxiety and improve mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Objectives: This survey conducted by the International Society of Radiology and supported by the European Society of Radiology aimed to collect information regarding radiology departments' current practices in the management of patients with COVID-19. Methods: Responses from 50 radiology departments involved in the management of COVID-19 patients representing 33 countries across all continents were analyzed. The analysis revealed important variations in imaging practices related to COVID-19 across the world for different disease severity and various clinical scenarios. Results: Imaging is usually not performed in asymptomatic patients (69% of institutions do not image) but is used at the end of confinement (in 60% of institutions). In the majority of institutions, chest imaging is used in suspected or confirmed patients with COVID-19 (89% and 94%). All imaging departments involved in this survey reported the use of imaging in COVID-19 patients showing severe symptoms or who were critically ill. However, there is a wide variation in imaging modality type used for each clinical scenario. The use of imaging is applied in line with existing guidelines and recommendations in 98% of institutions with structured reporting recorded in 58% of institutions. The vast majority of institutions reported a significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the imaging department's routine activity (83%). Conclusion: We believe that the results of this survey will help to understand current heterogeneities in radiology practice and to identify needs and gaps in the organization and function of radiology departments worldwide in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this survey may inform the development of an overall strategy for radiology department organization and imaging protocols in pandemic conditions. Key points: • The results of this survey, which included responses from 50 radiology departments representing 33 countries, showed important variations in imaging practices related to COVID-19 across the world. • While imaging is usually not performed in asymptomatic patients (69% of institutions), it is used in suspected or confirmed patients with COVID-19, in COVID-19 patients showing severe symptoms or who were critically ill, and at the end of confinement (89%, 94%, 100%, 100%, 60% of institutions, respectively). However, there is a wide variation in imaging modality type used for each clinical scenario. • In 98% of institutions, the use of imaging is applied in line with existing guidelines and recommendations, with structured reporting recorded in 58% of institutions.

"Cytokine pathways and their signaling disorders can be the cause of onset and pathogenesis of many diseases such as autoimmune diseases and COVID-19 infection. Autoimmune patients may be at higher risk of developing infection due to the impaired immune responses, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, and damage to various organs. Increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines and intolerance of the patient's immune system to COVID-19 infection are the leading causes of hospitalization of these patients. The content used in this paper has been taken from English language articles (2005-2020) retrieved from the PubMed database and Google Scholar search engine using ""COVID-19,"" ""Autoimmune disease,"" ""Therapeutic,"" ""Pathogenesis,"" and ""Pathway"" keywords. The emergence of COVID-19 and its association with autoimmune disorders is a major challenge in the management of these diseases. The results showed that the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of autoimmune diseases can make diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 more challenging by preventing the fever. Due to the common pathogenesis of COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases, the use of autoimmune drugs as a possible treatment option could help control the virus. KEY POINTS: • Inflammatory cytokines play an essential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 • ACE2 dysfunctions are related to the with COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases • The use autoimmune diseases drugs can be useful in treating COVID-19.",covid
"This study aims to understand the knowledge, attitudes and practices of COVID-19 in the Chinese context and to provide insights for developing targeted outbreak prevention and control measures among the general public. We conducted an online survey of urban and rural residents in Henan Province. A total of 517 valid questionnaires were collected via the online platform. The mean scores for knowledge and practice were 5.57/9 and 2.04/3, respectively. More than 90% of the participants believed COVID-19 was serious and preventable, were concerned about the disease process, and actively engaged in learning related knowledge. Our results showed that the COVID-19 knowledge level was significantly different among groups with different ages, genders, education levels and marital statuses; COVID-19 practice was significantly different among different regions. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that education level, female sex, unmarried status, and health care worker status had a significant impact on COVID-19 knowledge; urban area was associated with a higher practice score; COVID-19 knowledge was significantly associated with residents' attitude toward preventive measures that can prevent COVID-19 infection; urban area was significantly related to the willingness to go to a fever clinic to check for suspected infection. We found that Chinese urban and rural residents held a moderate level of COVID-19 knowledge and practice and showed a positive attitude toward the disease. It is necessary to develop relevant education programs targeting the general population in China to improve COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes and practices, particularly for rural and undereducated residents.",covid
"Objective: To study the clinical features of asymptomatic or subclinical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 53 children who were confirmed with asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19, including epidemiological history, clinical typing, co-infection, time to clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs, laboratory examination results, length of hospital stay, and treatment outcome. Results: The children with asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19 accounted for 30.5% (53/174) in children with COVID-19 hospitalized in the COVID-19 ward of Wuhan Children's Hospital. All cases occurred with familial aggregation. Among the 53 children, 35 (66%) had asymptomatic infection and 18 (34%) had subclinical infection. Mycoplasma infection was found in 17 children (32%). For the 53 children, the mean time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs was 9±4 days. Most laboratory markers were maintained within the normal range. The mean hospital stay was 11±4 days. Lung CT of 18 children with subclinical COVID-19 showed ground-glass opacities, linear opacities, and patchy opacities, with relatively limited lesions. Conclusions: There is a high proportion of children with asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19 among the children with COVID-19 hospitalized in the COVID-19 ward. The transmission risk of asymptomatic or subclinical COVID-19 should be taken seriously.",covid
"This document addresses the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic for providers and patients in labor and delivery (L&D). The goals are to provide guidance regarding methods to appropriately screen and test pregnant patients for COVID-19 prior to, and at admission to L&D reduce risk of maternal and neonatal COVID-19 disease through minimizing hospital contact and appropriate isolation; and provide specific guidance for management of L&D of the COVID-19-positive woman, as well as the critically ill COVID-19-positive woman. The first 5 sections deal with L&D issues in general, for all women, during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include Section 1: Appropriate screening, testing, and preparation of pregnant women for COVID-19 before visit and/or admission to L&D Section 2: Screening of patients coming to L&D triage; Section 3: General changes to routine L&D work flow; Section 4: Intrapartum care; Section 5: Postpartum care; Section 6 deals with special care for the COVID-19-positive or suspected pregnant woman in L&D and Section 7 deals with the COVID-19-positive/suspected woman who is critically ill. These are suggestions, which can be adapted to local needs and capabilities.",covid
"The World health organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic and a severe public health crisis. Drastic measures to combat COVID-19 are warranted due to its contagiousness and higher mortality rates, specifically in the aged patient population. At the current stage, due to the lack of effective treatment strategies for COVID-19 innovative approaches need to be considered. It is well known that host cellular miRNAs can directly target both viral 3'UTR and coding region of the viral genome to induce the antiviral effect. In this study, we did in silico analysis of human miRNAs targeting SARS (4 isolates) and COVID-19 (29 recent isolates from different regions) genome and correlated our findings with aging and underlying conditions. We found 848 common miRNAs targeting the SARS genome and 873 common microRNAs targeting the COVID-19 genome. Out of a total of 848 miRNAs from SARS, only 558 commonly present in all COVID-19 isolates. Interestingly, 315 miRNAs are unique for COVID-19 isolates and 290 miRNAs unique to SARS. We also noted that out of 29 COVID-19 isolates, 19 isolates have identical miRNA targets. The COVID-19 isolates, Netherland (EPI_ISL_422601), Australia (EPI_ISL_413214), and Wuhan (EPI_ISL_403931) showed six, four, and four unique miRNAs targets, respectively. Furthermore, GO, and KEGG pathway analysis showed that COVID-19 targeting human miRNAs involved in various age-related signaling and diseases. Recent studies also suggested that some of the human miRNAs targeting COVID-19 decreased with aging and underlying conditions. GO and KEGG identified impaired signaling pathway may be due to low abundance miRNA which might be one of the contributing factors for the increasing severity and mortality in aged individuals and with other underlying conditions. Further, in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validate some of these targets and identify potential therapeutic targets.",covid
"COVID-19 has forced governments to make drastic changes to healthcare systems. To start making informed decisions about cancer care, we need to understand the scale of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, we introduced swab testing for patients visiting Guy's Cancer Centre. Our Centre is one of the largest UK Cancer Centers at the epicenter of the UK COVID-19 epidemic. The first COVID-19 positive cancer patient was reported on 29 February 2020. We analyzed data from 7-15 May 2020 for COVID-19 tests in our cancer patients. 2,647 patients attended for outpatient, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy appointments. 654 were swabbed for COVID-19 (25%). Of those tested, 9 were positive for COVID-19 (1.38%) of which 7 were asymptomatic. Cancer service providers will need to understand their local cancer population prevalence. The absolute priority is that cancer patients have the confidence to attend hospitals and be reassured that they will be treated in a COVID-19 managed environment.",covid
"Importance: Solid organ transplants have declined significantly during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the US. Limited data exist regarding changes in heart transplant (HT). Objective: To describe national and regional trends in waitlist inactivations, waitlist additions, donor recovery, and HT volume during COVID-19. Design, setting, and participants: This descriptive cross-sectional study used publicly available data from the United Network for Organ Sharing and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using 8 prespecified United Network for Organ Sharing regions. Adult (18 years or older) HT candidates listed and deceased donors recovered between January 19 to May 9, 2020. Exposures: COVID-19 pandemic. Main outcomes and measures: Changes in waitlist inactivations, waitlist additions, deceased donor recovery, and transplant volumes from the pre-COVID-19 (January 19-March 15, 2020) to the COVID-19 era (March 15-May 9, 2020). Density mapping and linear regression with interrupted time series analysis were used to characterize changes over time and changes by region. Results: During the COVID-19 era, there were 600 waitlist inactivations compared with 343 during the pre-COVID era (75% increase). Waitlist additions decreased from 637 to 395 (37% reduction). These changes were most profound in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions with high rates of COVID-19. Deceased donor recovery decreased by 26% from 1878 to 1395; the most significant decrease occurred in the North Midwest despite low COVID-19 prevalence. Heart transplant volumes were significantly reduced across all regions except the Northwest. The largest decrease was seen in the Northeast where COVID-19 case rates were highest. From the pre-COVID-19 era to the COVID-19 era, there was significant regional variation in waitlist additions (eg, 69% decrease in the Northeast vs 8.5% increase in the South Midwest; P < .001) and deceased donor recovery (eg, 41% decrease in North Midwest vs 16% decrease in South Midwest; P = .02). Conclusions and relevance: Heart transplant volumes have been significantly reduced in recent months, even in regions with a lower prevalence of COVID-19 cases. This has been accompanied by increased waitlist inactivations, decreased waitlist additions, and decreased donor recovery. Future studies are needed to determine if the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with changes in waitlist mortality.",covid
"COVID-19 is a serious multisystem disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, that still keeps its impacts worldwide, numerous scheduled medical activities have been postponed and this interruption has a potential to modify the management of many cutaneous conditions including pemphigus. This narrative review aims to discuss the management of pemphigus in the era of COVID-19, considering the necessity to balance suitable pemphigus treatment with minimal risk of COVID-19-related mortality and morbidity. The data on the effect of treatments used for pemphigus on COVID-19 are limited. However, the evidence to manage patients properly is evolving and our knowledge is updated. Current expert recommendations include that patients with pemphigus should be informed clearly to avoid mismanagement and they should be monitored regularly for symptoms of COVID-19. Patients with mild disease can be managed with topical or intralesional corticosteroids, dapsone, or doxycycline. Systemic corticosteroids should be tapered to the lowest effective dose during the pandemic. Prednis(ol)one ≤10 mg/d can be continued in patients with COVID-19 while prednis(ol)one >10 mg/d may be reduced considering the activity of the disease. Conventional immunosuppressive therapies should only be discontinued in confirmed cases of COVID-19. Postponing rituximab treatment should be considered on a case by case basis. Intravenous immunoglobulin is not likely to increase the risk of infection and may be considered a safe option in patients with COVID-19. Given the psychological burden brought by COVID 19, online or face-to-face psychological support programs should be considered.",covid
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is sweeping through the world. The overwhelming pathology seems to be in the upper and lower respiratory tract; however, the involvement of other organs, including the liver, has also been reported. Whether liver enzyme derangement is a common feature of COVID-19 is not known. For those patients who have concomitant liver enzyme derangement with COVID-19, the prevalence, extent, and rate of progression to liver failure is not known. In view of unclear evidence regarding this, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on liver injury in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this review was to ascertain whether liver enzyme derangement is a common feature in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, determine the relation of deranged liver enzymes with outcome or mortality in COVID-19, and determine if liver failure is a common feature of COVID-19. The PubMed and OVID Medline databases were searched systematically. Cross-sectional studies and case-control studies involving adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 and having data on liver enzymes were included. Independent extraction of the data was done by two independent authors. A total of 23 articles were identified by the initial filtering search. Abstracts were reviewed and screened to shortlist studies. A full-text assessment of the shortlisted articles for eligibility criteria identified five articles. Manual searching via the LitCovid (National Library of Medicine tool) search hub produced a further two studies that were eligible. Many of the COVID-19 patients in the various studies had a varying degree of deranged liver enzymes. The degree of injury was mild in most cases; and it appears to correlate with the severity of COVID-19 infection. Severe liver injury causing significant liver damage, liver failure, or death is uncommon. The main limitations of the study were the heterogeneity of studies and incomplete data on the trajectory of liver tests during the disease course as well as the final outcomes of the patients in the studies.",covid
"Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, no data have been available for hospitalised psychiatric patients who are suspected to have COVID-19. We performed a comprehensive investigation of the clinical features of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with or without suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. Aim: To explore the clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. Methods: 21 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 (COVID-19 suspected group) in the isolation ward of a mental health hospital in Wuhan and 30 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia (clean group) in the general ward of another mental health hospital in Yichang were recruited. We retrospectively reviewed their clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest CT results before 21 February 2020. We also compared the emotional and mental symptoms between the two groups. Results: Medical records revealed that 21 COVID-19 suspected patients were transferred to the isolation ward between 30 January 2020 and 15 February 2020. The mean age (SD) of COVID-19 suspected patients was 43.1 (2.6). 12 (57.1%) patients showed abnormalities on chest CT before onset of respiratory symptoms. 14 (66.7%) patients had psychiatric medications adjustment after detection of abnormal chest CT findings. By 21 February, one patient was confirmed to have COVID-19. Even though the remaining 20 (95.2%) were negative for at least two reverse transcription PCR tests, 11 (52.4%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for clinically confirmed cases. Compared with patients in the clean group, patients in the suspected COVID-19 group showed significantly higher stress, depression and anxiety levels and poorer sleep quality. Conclusion: Setting up an independent isolation ward for hospitalised psychiatric patients who are suspected to have symptoms of COVID-19 helped control the spread of the epidemic. Patients with schizophrenia suspected to have COVID-19 showed increased stress and mood and sleep disturbances, which should be appropriately managed.",covid

"COVID-19 outbreak has promoted many public health measures in the general population. However, its impact on a vulnerable population with severe mental illness (SMI) is less addressed. Aim of this study was to determine the impact of COVID -19 to patients with SMI and identify its relation with their COVID-19 knowledge. A cross-sectional telephonic survey among 132 patients with SMI who were clinically stable before the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. A 23 item interview proforma comprising of self-reported knowledge related to COVID-19 by patients and their illness and treatment status from their caregivers. Eleven patients were completely not aware of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Three fourth of patients were not worried about getting COVID-19 and lacks adequate knowledge to identify symptoms. Two-third of patients lacked adequate knowledge of precautionary measures against COVID-19. One out of five patients lacked knowledge of the mode of transmission and stopped their psychiatric treatment. Thirty percent showed features of relapse of symptoms during this lockdown period. In multivariate regression analysis, patients from lower socioeconomic status, low literacy levels, with inadequate social support showed less knowledge related to COVID-19. Mental health services which target this vulnerable population during early disaster reduce the burden to the community.",covid
"Objective: To explore whether quarantine measures and hospital containment policies among women giving birth in a COVID-19 ""hotspot"" area in northeastern Italy enhanced psycho-emotional distress in the immediate postpartum period. Methods: We designed a non-concurrent case-control study of mothers who gave birth during a COVID-19 quarantine period between March 8 and May 3, 2020 (COVID-19 study group), with an antecedent group of matched postpartum women (control group) who delivered in the same period in 2019. Participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) on the second day postpartum. Results: The COVID-19 study group (n=91) had significantly higher mean EPDS scores compared with the control group (n=101) (8.5 ± 4.6 vs 6.34 ± 4.1; P<0.001). Furthermore, 28.6% of women in the COVID-19 group had a global EPDS score above 12. Analysis of three EPDS subscales revealed significantly higher scores among the COVID-19 group compared with the control group for anhedonia (0.60 ± 0.61 vs 0.19 ± 0.36; P<0.001) and depression (0.58 ± 0.54 vs 0.35 ± 0.45; P=0.001). Conclusions: Concerns about risk of exposure to COVID-19, combined with quarantine measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, adversely affected the thoughts and emotions of new mothers, worsening depressive symptoms.",covid
"Conspiracy theories have been proliferating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that belief in conspiracy theories undermines engagement in pro-health behaviors and support for public health policies. Moreover, previous work suggests that inoculating messages from opinion leaders that expose conspiracy theories as false before people are exposed to them can help to prevent belief in new conspiracies. Goals of this study were to: (a) explore associations between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions, cooperation with public health recommendations, and support for public health policies among U.S. adults and (b) investigate trusted sources of COVID-19 information to inform strategies to address conspiracy beliefs. A cross-sectional, online survey was conducted with 845 U.S. adults in April 2020. Data were analyzed using analyses of variance and multivariable regressions. One-third (33%) of participants believed one or more conspiracies about COVID-19. Participants who believed conspiracies reported that their intentions to vaccinate were 3.9 times lower and indicated less support for COVID-19 public health policies than participants who disbelieved conspiracies. There were no differences in cooperation with public health recommendations by conspiracy belief endorsement in the multivariable regression analysis. Although there were some key differences in trusted sources of COVID-19 information, doctor(s) were the most trusted source of information about COVID-19 overall with 90% of participants trusting doctor(s). Doctor(s) may play a role in addressing COVID-19 conspiracy theories before people are exposed to them to promote COVID-19 prevention efforts.",covid
"Due to its extreme virulence, COVID-19 virus has rapidly spread, developing a severe pandemic. SARS-COV-2 mostly affected the respiratory tract, causing a severe acute lung failure. Although the infection of airways, COVID-19 can be associated with chronic and systemic damages still not so much known. The purpose of this research is to collect recent evidence in literature about systemic diseases caused by COVID-19. The format of the present article has features of a systematic case-based review (level of evidence), and it is structured as a case series report (patients of our COVID-19 Medicine Ward have been selected as cases). Data for this review have been selected systematically, taking evidence only from indexed journals and databases: PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Cochrane systems. Papers chosen included systematic reviews, case series, clinical cases, meta-analysis studies, and RCTs. We start collecting studies since 2003.

"Background: A range of near-real-time online/mobile mapping dashboards and applications have been used to track the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. It remains unknown about small area-based spatiotemporal patterns of COVID-19 in the United States. Methods: We obtained county-based counts of COVID-19 cases confirmed in the United States from January 22 to May 13, 2020 (N=1,386,050). We characterized the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic through detecting weekly hotspots of newly confirmed cases using Spatial and Space-Time Scan Statistics and quantifying the trends of incidence of COVID-19 by county characteristics using the Joinpoint analysis. Results: Along with the national plateau reached in early April, COVID-19 incidence significantly decreased in the Northeast (estimated weekly percentage changes [EWPC]: -16.6%), but remained increasing in the Midwest, South and West Regions (EWPCs: 13.2%, 5.6%, and 5.7%, respectively). Higher risks of clustering and incidence of COVID-19 were consistently observed in metropolitan vs rural counties, counties closest to core airports, most populous counties, and counties with highest proportion of racial/ethnic minority counties. However, geographic differences in the incidence have shrunk since early April, driven by a significant decrease in the incidence in these counties (EWPC range: -2.0% - -4.2%) and a consistent increase in other areas (EWPC range: 1.5% - 20.3%). Conclusions: To substantially decrease the nationwide incidence of COVID-19, strict social distancing measures should be continuously implemented, especially in geographic areas with increasing risks, including rural areas. Spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of COVID-19 should be considered in decision-making on the timeline of re-opening for states and localities.",covid
"The pandemic outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic disease (COVID-19) is spreading like a diffusion-reaction in the world and almost 208 countries and territories are being affected around the globe. It became a sever health and socio-economic problem, while the world has no vaccine to combat this virus. This research aims to analyze the connection between the fast spread of COVID-19 and regional climate parameters over a global scale. In this research, we collected the data of COVID-19 cases from the time of 1st reported case to the 5th June 2020 in different affected countries and regional climatic parameters data from January 2020 to 5th June 2020. It was found that most of the countries located in the relatively lower temperature region show a rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases than the countries locating in the warmer climatic regions despite their better socio-economic conditions. A correlation between metrological parameters and COVID-19 cases was observed. Average daylight hours are correlated to total the COVID-19 cases with a coefficient of determination of 0.42, while average high-temperature shows a correlation of 0.59 and 0.42 with total COVID-19 cases and death cases respectively. The finding of the study will help international health organizations and local administrations to combat and well manage the spread of COVID-19.",covid

"Although it is well established that cigarette smoking is associated with morbidity and mortality in several respiratory infections, data from recent studies suggest that active smokers are underrepresented among patients with COVID-19. This has led to claims that a 'smoker's paradox' may exist in COVID-19, wherein smokers are protected from infection and severe complications of COVID-19. We aimed to review and summarise existing literature in this context. Electronic databases were searched for articles that reported prevalence of smokers among patients with COVID-19 or studied any association of smoking with outcomes among patients with COVID-19. We identified several biases and knowledge gaps which may give the false impression that smoking is protective in COVID-19. As of now, the data supporting smoker's paradox claims are limited and questionable. Plausible biologic mechanisms by which smoking might be protective in COVID-19 include an anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine, a blunted immune response in smokers (reducing the risk of a cytokine storm in COVID-19) and increased nitric oxide in the respiratory tract (which may inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its entry into cells). On the other hand, smoking may worsen susceptibility and prognosis in COVID-19, in a manner similar to other respiratory infections. The claims of a protective effect must be viewed with extreme caution by both the general population as well as clinicians. Further investigations into the interaction between smoking and COVID-19 are warranted to accurately assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 among smokers, and progression to mechanical ventilation or death in patients suffering from it.",covid
"Aims of the study: Many centres have noticed a high number of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events among critically ill inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The aims of this study were (1) to summarise the reported risk of VTE associated with COVID-19 infections and (2) to summarise guidance documents on thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 patients, in a systematic review. Methods: We systematically searched for peer-reviewed evidence on the risk of VTE in patients with COVID-19, in PubMed, Embase and Twitter, and for guidelines or guidance documents for thromboprophylaxis, from international or national societies relevant to the field of thrombosis and haemostasis, up to April 30 2020. Results: We found 11 studies (1 clinical trial, 7 retrospective cohorts and 3 prospective cohorts), which included a range of 16 to 388 in patients with COVID-19 (total of 1369 inpatients). The diagnoses of COVID-19 and VTE were of high quality, but the follow-up was often unclear. Most studies reported universal in-hospital thromboprophylaxis. Among all inpatients and among intensive care unit (ICU) inpatients with COVID-19, reported risks of VTE were 4.4&ndash;8.2% (three studies) and 0&ndash;35.3% (six studies), respectively. Two studies at least partially screened for VTE in ICU inpatients with COVID-19, and found risks of 24.7&ndash;53.8%. We found 12 guidelines for thromboprophylaxis of COVID-19 patients. The majority suggested universal pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in all COVID-19 inpatients, but there was heterogeneity in the suggested intensity of thromboprophylaxis: seven advised considering intensified doses of heparin according to the clinical or biological severity of the disease, especially in the ICU setting. Conclusions: Venous thromboembolism very commonly complicates the clinical course of inpatients with COVID-19, despite thromboprophylaxis. The risk appears highest among critically ill inpatients. We found no estimates of risks among outpatients. Many questions remain unresolved, as delineated by the heterogeneity of national and international guidelines. This situation calls for fast randomised clinical trials, comparing different schemes of thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 inpatients.",covid
"Background: COVID-19 has been associated with increased risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism including ischemic stroke. We report on patients with acute ischemic stroke and concomitant COVID-19 in a diverse patient population. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and COVID-19 to our comprehensive stroke center in Chicago, IL, between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. We reviewed stroke characteristics, etiologies, and composite outcomes. We then compared our cohort with historic patients with AIS without COVID-19 admitted in the same time frame in 2019 and 2020. Results: Out of 13 patients with AIS and COVID-19, Latinos and African-Americans compromised the majority of our cohort (76.8%), with age ranging from 31-80 years. Most strokes were cortical (84.6%) and more than 50% of patients had no identifiable source, and were categorized as embolic stroke of unknown source (ESUS). A trend toward less alteplase administration was noted in the COVID-19 stroke patients compared to the non-COVID group from 2020 and 2019 (7.1 vs. 20.7% p 0.435 and 7.1 vs. 27.2% p 0.178). Endovascular thrombectomy was performed in 3 (23%) patients. Systemic thrombotic complications occurred in 3 (23%) COVID-19 AIS patients. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale at discharge were 11 (IQR 4-23) and 4 (IQR 3-4), respectively. In the logistic regression model corrected for age and sex, COVID-19 was associated with discharge to mRS > 2 (p 0.046, OR 3.82, CI 1.02-14.3). Eight patients (63.8%) were discharged home or to acute rehabilitation, and two deceased from COVID-19 complications. Conclusion: AIS in the setting of COVID-19 is associated with worse outcomes, especially among African-American and Latino populations. Large vessel disease with ESUS was common suggesting an increased risk of coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction as a potential etiology.",covid
"Background: COVID-19 pandemia is a major challenge to worldwide health care systems. Whereas the majority of disease presents with mild symptoms that can be treated as outpatients, severely ill COVID-19 patients and patients presenting with similar symptoms cross their ways in the emergency department. Especially, the variety of symptoms is challenging with primary triage. Are there parameters to distinguish between proven COVID-19 and without before? How can a safe and efficient management of these inpatients be achieved? Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 314 consecutive inpatient patients who presented with possible symptoms of COVID-19 in a German emergency department between March and April 2020 and were tested with a SARS-Cov-2 nasopharyngeal swab. Clinical parameters, Manchester Triage System categories, and lab results were compared between patients with positive and negative test results for SARS-Cov-2. Furthermore, we present the existing COVID-19 workflow model of the university hospital in Essen which proved to be efficient during pandemia. Results: Forty-three of the 314 patients (13.7%) were tested positive for COVID-19 by SARS-Cov-2 nasopharyngeal swab. We did not find any laboratory parameter to distinguish safely between patients with COVID-19 and those with similar symptoms. Dysgeusia was the only clinical symptom that was significantly more frequent among COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Dysgeusia seems to be a typical symptom for COVID-19, which occurred in 14% of our COVID-19 patients. However, no valid parameters could be found to distinguish clinically between COVID-19 and other diseases with similar symptoms. Therefore, early testing, a strict isolation policy, and proper personal protection are crucial to maintain workflow and safety of patients and ED staff for the months to come.

Outcome data at 30 days post-operation were collected, including documented COVID-19 cases in patients and reported cases in healthcare workers directly involved in their care. Recommended modifications to practice to reduce COVID-19 transmission risk, both to patients and healthcare workers in each centre, are described. Results A total of 202 patients underwent surgery in four hospitals delivering breast services in the West Yorkshire region over the six-week period at the peak of the pandemic. The age ranged from 28 to 91 years (median 57, interquartile range, 48-65) with 22% having co-morbidities linked to COVID-19, e.g. diabetes or respiratory disease. No patients presented post-operatively with COVID-19 symptoms and at 30 days there had not been any identified COVID-19 cases. There were no unexpected critical care admissions or deaths. One healthcare worker involved in the delivery of breast surgery was diagnosed with COVID-19 during this time and made an uneventful recovery. Conclusion Breast cancer surgery, in selected groups and with meticulous adherence to measures designed to reduce COVID-19 transmission, does not appear to be associated with elevated risk to patients or healthcare workers.",covid
"Purpose: In the United States, over 2 million cases of COVID-19 cases have been identified and more than 100,000 lives have been lost. While COVID-19 related disparities among those with chronic conditions have been observed, research regarding the uptake of COVID-related preventive behaviors is scarce. Methods: We utilized data from a sample of 2190 U.S. adults from the COVID-19 Impact Survey to examine associations between the presence of underlying chronic health conditions and COVID-19-related preventive behaviors (e.g., use of face masks, hand washing, social distancing, etc.). We used multivariable logistic regression models to model associations between COVID-19 preventive behaviors across demographic and health characteristics. Results: Adults with cardiometabolic disease were more likely to report staying home because they felt unwell, compared with individuals without cardiometabolic disease. Individuals with underlying respiratory conditions were more likely to work from home, compared with individuals without a respiratory condition. Adults with immune conditions were twice more likely to report wearing a face mask when compared with individuals without immune conditions. Conclusion: This study provides U.S. national prevalence estimates and differences in adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors among those with and without the presence of underlying chronic health conditions. The prevalence of key preventive measures was high in the overall sample. Yet, engagement in COVID-19-related preventive behaviors varied significantly across chronic disease conditions. Messages around continued maintenance of the behaviors should be reinforced. Study implications suggest a need for more targeted messaging and resources available for individuals with certain underlying chronic conditions.",covid
"Objective: This study retrospectively examined the health and social determinants of the COVID-19 outbreak in 175 countries from a spatial epidemiological approach. Methods: We used spatial analysis to examine the cross-national determinants of confirmed cases of COVID-19 based on the World Health Organization official COVID-19 data and the World Bank Indicators of Interest to the COVID-19 outbreak. All models controlled for COVID-19 government measures. Results: The percentage of the population age between 15-64 years (Age15-64), percentage smokers (SmokTot.), and out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPExp) significantly explained global variation in the current COVID-19 outbreak in 175 countries. The percentage population age group 15-64 and out of pocket expenditure were positively associated with COVID-19. Conversely, the percentage of the total population who smoke was inversely associated with COVID-19 at the global level. Conclusions: This study is timely and could serve as a potential geospatial guide to developing public health and epidemiological surveillance programs for the outbreak in multiple countries. Removal of catastrophic medical expenditure, smoking cessation, and observing public health guidelines will not only reduce illness related to COVID-19 but also prevent unecessary deaths.",covid
"Background: Healthcare professionals (HPs) are the key figures to keep up the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic and thus are one of the most vulnerable groups in this. To this point, the extent of this psychological burden, especially in Europe and Germany, remains unclear. This is the first study investigating German HPs after the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We performed an online-based cross-sectional study after the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany (10-31 March 2020). In total, 2224 HPs (physicians n = 492, nursing staff n = 1511, paramedics n = 221) and 10 639 non-healthcare professionals (nHPs) were assessed including generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2), current health status (EQ-5D-3L), COVID-19-related fear, subjective level of information regarding COVID-19. Results: HPs showed less generalized anxiety, depression and COVID-19-related fear and higher health status and subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 than the nHPs. Within the HP groups, nursing staff were the most psychologically burdened. Subjective levels of information regarding COVID-19 correlated negatively with generalized anxiety levels across all groups. Among HPs, nursing staff showed the highest and paramedics the lowest generalized anxiety levels. Conclusions: In the context of COVID-19, German HPs seem to be less psychological burdened than nHPs, and also less burdened compared with existing international data.",covid
"Background The use of CT imaging enhanced by artificial intelligence to effectively diagnose COVID-19, instead of or in addition to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), can improve widespread COVID-19 detection and resource allocation. Methods 904 axial lung window CT slices from 338 patients in 17 countries were collected and labeled. The data included 606 images from COVID-19 positive patients (confirmed via RT-PCR), 224 images of a variety of other pulmonary diseases including viral pneumonias, and 74 images of normal patients. We developed, trained, validated, and tested an object detection model which detects features in three categories: ground-glass opacities (GGOs) for COVID-19, GGOs for non-COVID-19 diseases, and features that are inconsistent with a COVID-19 diagnosis. These collected features are passed into an interpretable decision tree model to make a suggested diagnosis. Results On an independent test of 219 images from COVID-19 positive, a variety of pneumonia, and healthy patients, the model predicted COVID-19 diagnoses with an accuracy of 96.80 % (95% confidence interval [CI], 96.75 to 96.86) , AUC-ROC of 0.9664 (95% CI, 0.9659 to 0.9671) , sensitivity of 98.33% (95% CI, 98.29 to 98.40) , precision of 95.93% (95% CI, 95.83 to 95.99), and specificity of 94.95% (95% CI, 94.84 to 95.05). On an independent test of 34 images from asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients, our model achieved an accuracy of 97.06% (95% CI, 96.81 to 97.06) and a sensitivity of 96.97% (95% CI, 96.71 to 96.97). Similarly high performance was also obtained for out-of-sample countries, and no significant performance difference was obtained between genders. Conclusion We present an interpretable artificial intelligence CT analysis tool to diagnose COVID-19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Further, our model is able to differentiate COVID-19 GGOs from similar pathologies suggesting that GGOs can be disease-specific.",covid
"Objective: To investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 135 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin. Methods: The clinical and epidemiological data of 135 cases of COVID-19 in Tianjin were collected, and the data were analyzed with descriptive method. The factors influencing the severity of the illness were analyzed. Results: Among the 135 COVID-19 cases, 72 were males and 63 were females, the age of the cases was (48.62±16.83) years, and the case fatality rate was 2.22%. Local transmission caused 74.81% of the cases. A total of 33 clusters occurred, involving 85.92% of all COVID-19 cases. The median of the incubation period of COVID-19 was 6.50 days, the average generation interval was 5 days, and the household secondary transmission rate was 20.46%. Fever was the main symptom (78.63%), followed by cough (56.48%). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that age (OR=1.038, 95%CI: 1.010-1.167) and the number of chronic underlying diseases (OR=1.709, 95%CI: 1.052-2.777) were the risk factors of severe illness. Conclusions: Fever was the main symptom at the early phase of COVID-19 in Tianjin, and the local cluster cases accounted for high proportion in confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Tianjin. Severe illness was prone to occur in people with old age and multi underlying diseases. Strict isolation of close contacts and intensive care of high-risk groups are the main measures to reduce the morbidity and case fatality of COVID-19.",covid
"It is generally recognized that psychosocial interventions are an essential component in dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak. Research focusing on the handling of psychosocial conditions in the COVID-19 outbreak seems sparse. After reviewing several scholarly articles, we recommend several things that can be used as a basis for developing practical guidelines for handling psychosocial problems, especially in East Java Province, Indonesia. Development of practical guidelines for first-hand response and early treatment of psychosocial aspects of COVID-19 in East Java Province, Indonesia, based on the recommendations of 14 articles related to COVID-19 psychosocial handling was carried out. Some evidence strongly supports the need for knowledge about the stages of COVID-19, understanding of psychosocial responses, understanding of psychosocial interventions, and availability of hotline services in psychosocial interventions at each stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. It is important to provide practical guidance for the early management of psychosocial aspects of the innovative COVID-19 in providing more comprehensive care. There is strong evidence of the need for practical guidance on initial handling of the psychosocial aspects of COVID-19 for the community, especially in Indonesia's East Java Province.",covid
"Rationale and objectives: An increasing number of neurological complications and corresponding radiological findings have been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the current literature on COVID-19-associated neuroradiological findings and examine the prevalence of different findings in patients with both severe and mild COVID-19 infection. Materials and methods: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed and Embase databases was performed. Any studies reporting CT or MRI neuroimaging findings in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. Patient demographics, main radiological findings, neurological symptoms, and severity of COVID-19 infection were tabulated and quantified according to infection severity. Results: Sixty-one studies published between 2019 and 2020 comprising 711 patients were analyzed according to severity of respiratory symptoms. The main neuroradiological findings for patients with mild classification were cranial nerve abnormalities, ischemic infarction, and white matter abnormalities, while the main findings in patients with severe classification were white matter abnormalities, ischemic infarction, and hemorrhagic events. Conclusion: Neuroradiological manifestations in COVID-19 infection are highly heterogeneous and differ based on the severity of COVID-19 infection. Cranial nerve abnormalities appear exclusive to mild infection, with a high degree of olfactory tract involvement, while hemorrhagic events are more common in severe infection. Notably, ischemic infarction was equally prevalent in both mild and severe COVID-19 infection. Healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients should be aware of these potential complications and consider neurological assessment and neuroimaging studies when indicated.",covid
"Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now been declared a global public health disaster with no currently available vaccine. This study was undertaken to analyse the effect of meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed on the spread of ongoing COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Methods: The COVID-19 dashboard for five major cities of Saudi Arabia - Riyadh, Makah, Jeddah, Medina and Dammam was used for data collection. The data on weather were collected from the Weather Underground Company (IBM business GA, USA, 2020). The data were analysed by Spearman's rank correlations using JASP statistical software in two main sections. In the first section the data on COVID-19 from cities were combined to analyse the overall picture of COVID-19 and in the second section, different meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity and wind speed were analysed. Results: Novel data revealed interesting facts on the spreading of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, the data showed that the number of COVID-19 positive cases increases due to the decrease of temperature or humidity, whereas an average decrease in the wind speed was also found to be associated with an elevation of the number of positive cases. Conclusions: This study determined the impact meteorological factors on the infectivity rate of COVID-19. An inverse association was found between the meteorological parameters with the spreading of COIVD-19. Therefore, this study directs the health authorities to implement specific measures against the spreading of this global pandemic based on weather patterns.",covid
"Background: To investigate the association between parameters indicating immunity from BCG at country level (presence of BCG vaccination policy, BCG coverage, age-specific incidence of tuberculosis (TB)) and the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Methods: Country-specific data for COVID-19 cases and deaths, demographic details, BCG coverage and policy, age-specific TB incidence and income level were obtained. The crude COVID-19 cases and deaths per 100,000 population were calculated and assessed against the parameters indicating immunity from BCG using linear regression analysis. Results: Univariate analysis identified higher income level of a country to be significantly associated with COVID-19 cases (p < 0.0001) and deaths (p < 0.0001) but not with its case fatality rate. The association between COVID-19 and TB was strongest for TB incidence in patients > 65-years (Cases (rs = - 0.785,p = 0.0001)) and deaths (rs = - 0.647,p = 0.0001).Multivariate analysis identified the higher income level of a country and not having a universal BCG vaccination policy to affect the COVID-19 cases. The deaths were inversely affected by the presence of BCG vaccination policy and coverage; and positively by the TB incidence in patients > 65-years. Conclusion: Significant inverse correlations observed between cases and deaths of COVID-19 and BCG related parameters highlights immunity from BCG as a likely explanation for the variation in COVID-19 across countries.",covid
"Objectives: This study aimed to examine the link between human mobility and the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected people in countries. Study design: Our data set covers 144 countries for which complete data are available. To analyze the link between human mobility and COVID-19-infected people, our study focused on the volume of air travel, the number of airports, and the Schengen system. Methods: To analyze the variation in COVID-19-infected people in countries, we used negative binomial regression analysis. Results: Our findings suggest a positive relationship between higher volume of airline passenger traffic carried in a country and higher numbers of patients with COVID-19. We further found that countries which have a higher number of airports are associated with higher number of COVID-19 cases. Schengen countries, countries which have higher population density, and higher percentage of elderly population are also found to be more likely to have more COVID-19 cases than other countries. Conclusions: The article brings a novel insight into the COVID-19 pandemic from a human mobility perspective. Future research should assess the impacts of the scale of sea/bus/car travel on the epidemic. The findings of this article are relevant for public health authorities, community and health service providers, as well as policy-makers.",covid
"OBJECTIVE The present study aimed to investigate the role of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an inflammation marker, complete blood count, and biochemical parameters in the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS A total of 80 patients who had been hospitalized in the internal medicine clinic were enrolled in the study. The cases were allocated into two groups, i.e., COVID (+) and (-), based on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory [NLR, platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), complete blood count, biochemistry, and serology] data of the patients were retrospectively obtained from the hospital data management system. RESULTS NLR and fever levels were found to be higher in COVID-19 (+) cases (P=0.021, P=0.001, respectively). There was no difference between males and females with regard to COVID-19 positivity (P=0.527). Total bilirubin levels were found to be lower in COVID-19 (+) cases (P=0.040). When the ROC analysis was carried out for NLR in COVID-19 (+) cases, the AUC value was found to be 0.660 (P=0.021), sensitivity as 69.01 %, specificity as 65.40 %, LR+: 1.98 and LR- : 0.48, PPV: 80.43, and NPV: 50.00, when the NLR was ≥2.4. The risk of COVID-19 was found to be 20.3-fold greater when NLR was ≥ 2.4 in the logistic regression (P=0.007). CONCLUSION NLR is an independent predictor for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We also found that fever and total bilirubin measurements could be useful for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in this population.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has caused a large global pandemic and poses a serious threat to public health. More than four million cases of COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been confirmed as of May 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic and transmissible coronavirus that primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and close contact. A growing body of clinical data suggests that a cytokine storm is associated with COVID-19 severity and is also a crucial cause of death from COVID-19. In the absence of antivirals and vaccines for COVID-19, there is an urgent need to understand the cytokine storm in COVID-19. Here, we have reviewed the current understanding of the features of SARS-CoV-2 and the pathological features, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatments of the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19. Additionally, we suggest that the identification and treatment of the cytokine storm are important components for rescuing patients with severe COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has dramatically changed our habits and routines. Uncertainty, insecurity, instability for the present and future, and reduced autonomy and self-directedness, are common feelings at the time of COVID-19. These aspects are very important during emerging adulthood. In spite of the fact that medical reports suggest that youth are less prone to experience COVID-19 infections, emerging adults might be at higher risk for their psychological adjustment. Emerging adults showed higher concerns about their role as a possible asymptomatic carrier than being positive with COVID-19 themselves. Both worries and concerns about COVID-19 and psychological maladjustment may be related to cultural factors. Individualism, collectivism, equality, and hierarchy seem to be meaningful perspectives to take into account. A total of 1183 Italian emerging adults were asked to fill out an online survey during the second week of the national lockdown in Italy. Results showed they reported an accurate perceived knowledge about COVID-19. At the same time, they showed higher worries and concerns about COVID-19 for their relatives, followed by more general/social worries. The lowest score included worries about COVID-19 related to themselves. State anxiety and stress levels were above the normal cutoff, confirming the challenges that emerging adults are facing during the pandemic. On one hand, emerging adults' collectivistic orientation was related to higher perceived risks of infection; on the other hand, it predicted lower psychological maladjustment, controlling for socio-demographic variables. The study suggests that to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and decrease levels of psychological maladjustment in emerging adulthood, individuals' cultural orientation such as the wish of sharing common goals with others, interdependence, and sociability, have to be emphasized and promoted as protective factors.",covid
"Aims: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The disease severity in 2019 novel coronavirus (Covid 19) infection has varied from mild self-limiting flu-like illness to fulminant pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. Since DM and Covid 19 infection are closely associated with inflammatory status, mean platelet volume (MPV) was suggested to be useful in predicting Covid infection onset. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic role of MPV in Covid patients with diabetes. Methods: A total of 640 subjects (160 Covid patients with type 2 diabetes, 160 healthy controls, 160 patients with non-spesific infections and 160 Covid patients without type 2 diabetes) enrolled in the study. Results: MPV was significantly higher (11.21 ± 0.61 fL) as compared to the results from the last routine visits of the the same individuals with diabetes (10.59 ± 0.96 fL) (p = 0.000). Conclusions: MPV could be used as a simple and cost-effective tool to predict the Covid infection in subjects with diabetes in primary care.",covid
"Background: COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has killed more than 175,000 people in the US. During a time of social distancing measures and increasing social isolation, green spaces may be a crucial factor to maintain a physically and socially active lifestyle while not increasing risk of infection. Objectives: We evaluated whether greenness is related to COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the United States. Methods: We downloaded data on COVID-19 cases and deaths for each US county up through June 7, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. We used April-May 2020 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, to represent the greenness exposure during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the US. We fitted negative binomial mixed models to evaluate associations of NDVI with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, adjusting for potential confounders such as county-level demographics, epidemic stage, and other environmental factors. We evaluated whether the associations were modified by population density, proportion of Black residents, median home value, and issuance of stay-at-home order. Results: An increase of 0.1 in NDVI was associated with a 6% (95% Confidence Interval: 3%, 10%) decrease in COVID-19 incidence rate after adjustment for potential confounders. Associations with COVID-19 incidence were stronger in counties with high population density and high median home values, and in counties with stay-at-home orders. Greenness was not associated with COVID-19 mortality in all counties; however, it was protective in counties with high percentages of Black residents, high median home value, and higher population density. Discussion: Exposures to NDVI had beneficial impacts on county-level incidence of COVID-19 in the US and may have reduced county-level COVID-19 mortality rates, especially in densely populated counties.",covid
"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has caused changes in the surgical treatment of non-Covid patients, especially in thoracic surgery because most procedures are aerosol generating. Hospital Kuala Lumpur, where thoracic procedures are performed, was badly affected. We describe our experience in performing aerosol generating procedures safely in thoracic surgery during the Covid-19 era. Methods: Medical records of patients who underwent thoracic surgery from March 18, 2020 to May 17, 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. All patients undergoing thoracic surgery were tested for Covid-19 using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method. Patients with malignancy were observed for 10 to 14 days in the ward after testing negative. The healthcare workers donned personal protective equipment for all the cases, and the number of healthcare workers in the operating room was limited to the minimum required. Results: A total of 44 procedures were performed in 26 thoracic surgeries. All of these procedures were classified as aerosol generating, and the mean duration of the surgery was 130 ± 43 minutes. None of the healthcare workers involved in the surgery were exposed or infected by Covid-19. Conclusion: Covid-19 will be a threat for a long time and thoracic surgeons must continue to provide their services, despite having to deal with aerosol generating procedures, in the new normal. Covid-19 testing of all surgical candidates, using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, donning full personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, and carefully planned procedures are among the measures suggested to prevent unnecessary Covid-19 exposure in thoracic surgery.",covid
"Introduction: U.S. commercial drivers are entrenched in a stressogenic profession, and exposures to endemic chronic stressors shape drivers' behavioral and psychosocial responses and induce profound health and safety disparities. To gain a complete understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect commercial driver stress, health, and safety over time, and to mitigate these impacts, research and prevention efforts must be grounded in theoretical perspectives that contextualize these impacts within the chronic stressors already endemic to profession, the historical and ongoing forces that have induced them, and the potentially reinforcing nature of the resulting afflictions. Methods: Extant literature reveals how an array of macro-level changes has shaped downstream trucking industry policies, resulting in stressogenic work organization and workplace characteristics. Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates existing stressors and introduces novel stressors, with potentially exacerbatory impacts on health and safety disparities. Results: As COVID-19 exerts an array of multi-level stressors on commercial drivers, syndemic frameworks can provide the appropriate theoretical lens to guide research and prevention. Syndemic frameworks can provide the grounding to allow foregoing commercial driver COVID-19 research to transcend the limitations of prevailing research frameworks by contextualizing COVID-19 stressors holistically within the complex system of endemic chronic stressors and interrelated health and safety afflictions. Syndemic-informed prevention efforts can then be implemented that simultaneously tackle multiple afflictions and the macro-level forces that result in the emergence of commercial drivers' health and safety disparities over time. Conclusions: The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial drivers cannot be adequately understood or acted upon in isolation from the endemic chronic stressors and interrelated health and safety disparities that characterize the profession. Instead, commercial driver COVID-19 research and prevention needs syndemic frameworks to holistically understand the impacts of COVID-19 on commercial driver stress, health, and safety, and to identify high-leverage preventive actions.",covid
"An epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans, which appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019, was caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). This disease was named as ""Coronavirus Disease 2019"" (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 was first identified as an etiological pathogen of COVID-19, belonging to the species of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV). The speed of both the geographical transmission and the sudden increase in numbers of cases is much faster than SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). COVID-19 is the first global pandemic caused by a coronavirus, which outbreaks in 211 countries/territories/areas. The vaccine against COVID-19, regarded as an effective prophylactic strategy for control and prevention, is being developed in about 90 institutions worldwide. The experiences and lessons encountered in the previous SARS and MERS vaccine research can be used for reference in the development of COVID-19 vaccine. The present paper hopes to provide some insights for COVID-19 vaccines researchers.",covid
"COVID-19 is spreading almost all over the world at present, which is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). It was an epidemic firstly in Hubei province of China. The Chinese government has formally set COVID-19 in the statutory notification and control system for infectious diseases according to the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases. China currently is still struggling to respond to COVID-19 though intensive actions with progress made. The Burn Department of our hospital is one of sections with the highest infectious risk of COVID-19. Based on our own experience and the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (7th Version) with other regulations and literature, we describe our experience with suggestions for medical practices for burn units during the COVID-19 outbreak. We hope these experiences and suggestions benefit our international colleagues during the pandemic of the COVID-19.",covid
"Objectives: The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, was officially recognised in the KSA in March 2020. Registered nurses (RNs) play a frontline role in the delivery of healthcare services to the COVID-19 patients. This role has potentially exposed RNs to infection with its associated consequences. We conducted this study to assess the psychological effects of fear and stress, and level of resilience to the COVID-19 outbreak by RNs in KSA. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited all RNs working with patients with the COVID-19 in KSA during the outbreak. All participants completed an anonymous questionnaire, which included items about their sociodemographic details, job stress related to the COVID-19, and fear of infection. Data were analysed with descriptive correlation statistics and multiple regression tests. Results: In total, 314 RNs responded to our survey. The results showed that the RNs had high levels of anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. RNs were fearful about their safety and the well-being of their families. However, RNs felt more responsible for providing care to the COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our results signalled some predictive factors that increased RNs' level of fear, such as social media (β = 0.76, p = 0.03), exposure to trauma prior to the outbreak (β = -0.95, p = 0.003), and readiness to care for infected patients (β = -0.21, p = 0.001). Conclusion: This study reports high levels of perceived stress and fear among RNs in KSA while caring for patients with the COVID-19. Furthermore, certain factors have a significant impact on RNs' psychological status, which may affect the quality of patient care and safety.",covid
"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally and placed healthcare systems under substantial strain. Hip fracture patients represent a high-risk population for severe COVID-19 symptoms, as they are generally older with multiple medical comorbidities. There has been limited information available on the presenting characteristics and outcomes of COVID-positive patients with hip fractures who undergo surgical treatment. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 10 patients ≥60 years of age with a hip fracture and COVID-19 who underwent surgical treatment in New York City during the COVID-19 outbreak from March 1, 2020 to May 22, 2020. Clinical characteristics and early postoperative outcomes were reported. Results: Eight out of the 10 COVID-positive hip fracture patients in our series were asymptomatic on admission with no clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Only 2 patients presented with hypoxia. All 10 patients underwent surgery within 2 days of admission. Five out of the 10 patients - including the patients who presented with hypoxia - subsequently required supplemental oxygen postoperatively. Two patients had persistently elevated oxygen demands requiring prolonged administration of supplemental oxygen therapy beyond postoperative day 3. None of the patients were put on mechanical ventilation. One patient had a presumed venous thromboembolism postoperatively and subsequently died on postoperative day 19, likely due to respiratory failure. There were no other deaths in the early postoperative period. The average length of inpatient stay was 7.8 days. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that hip fracture patients who present with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection may have temporarily increased oxygen demands postoperatively, but they can safely undergo early surgical intervention after appropriate medical optimization.",covid
"Background: The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is poorly understood. Objective: To rapidly identify areas of need and improve care in people with PD during the COVID-19 pandemic, we deployed a survey to assess COVID-19 symptoms and the pandemic's effect among those with and without COVID-19. Methods: People with and without PD participating in the online study Fox Insight (FI) were invited to complete a survey between April 23 and May 23, 2020. Among people reporting COVID-19 diagnoses, we compared symptoms and outcomes in people with and without PD. Among people not reporting COVID-19, we assessed access to healthcare and services and PD symptoms. Results: 7,209/9,762 active FI users responded (approximately 74% response rate), 5,429 people with PD and 1,452 without PD. COVID-19 diagnoses were reported by 51 people with and 26 without PD. Complications were more frequent in people with longer PD duration. People with PD and COVID-19 experienced new or worsening motor (63%) and nonmotor (75%) symptoms. People with PD not diagnosed with COVID-19 reported disrupted medical care (64%), exercise (21%), and social activities (57%), and worsened motor (43%) and non-motor (52%) symptoms. Disruptions were more common for those living alone, with lower income and non-white race. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with wide-ranging effects on people with PD, and certain groups may be at particular risk. FI provides a rapid, patient-centered means to assess these effects and identify needs that can be used to improve the health of people with PD.",covid
"Background: Early detection, isolation and management of COVID-19 are crucial to contain the current pandemic. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently included 'sudden loss of taste (dysgeusia/ageusia) and smell (anosmia/hyposmia)' as symptoms of COVID-19. If indeed these symptoms are reliable and specific forerunner symptoms of COVID-19, then it may facilitate detection and containment of the disease. Hence, we systematically evaluated the contemporary evidence on dysgeusia and anosmia as trigger prodromal symptoms, and their prevalence in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO host and Web of Science databases were searched between 25 December 2019 and 30 May 2020. Results: Of the 13 identified records, eight studies, totalling 11,054 COVID-19 patients, were included, as per the selection criteria. Eligible articles reflected research conducted mostly in the European community, as well as China, the US and Iran. In total, anosmia and dysgeusia symptoms were present in 74.9% and 81.3% ambulatory as well as hospitalized, mild-to-severe cases of COVID-19 patients, respectively. The European, US and Iran data indicate olfactory and gustatory symptoms appear prior to general COVID-19 symptoms in 64.5% and 54.0% of the patients, respectively. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review analysing the meager data based on the prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19. Critical analysis of such macro-data, as and when available, is essential to evaluate their utility as harbingers of COVID-19 onset, and to establish clinical practice guidelines both in dentistry and medicine.",covid
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created anxiety among members of the public, including all women over the childbirth continuum, who are considered to be at a greater risk of contracting most infectious diseases. Understanding the perspectives of health care consumers on COVID-19 will play a crucial role in the development of effective risk communication strategies. This study aimed to examine COVID-19-related risk perceptions, knowledge, and information sources among prenatal and postnatal Chinese women during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was adopted, and a four-section online questionnaire was used to collect data. Using a social media platform, the online survey was administered to 161 participants during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nanjing, China, in February 2020. Results: The participants perceived their risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19 to be lower than their risk of contracting influenza, however many of them were worried that they might contract COVID-19. The participants demonstrated adequate knowledge about COVID-19. The three major sources from which they obtained information about COVID-19 were doctors, nurses/midwives, and the television, and they placed a high level of confidence in these sources. There was no significant relationship between the perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 and knowledge about this disease. Conclusion: The present findings offer valuable insights to healthcare professionals, including midwives, who serve on the frontline and provide care to pregnant women. Although the participants were adequately knowledgeable about COVID-19, they had misunderstood some of the recommendations of the World Health Organisation.",covid
"Purpose: The review aims to provide a summary of the current literature regarding common medications prescribed in orthopaedic surgery and their potential implications in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A systematic review was performed using the PRISMA guidelines. All clinical studies, reviews, consensus and guidelines related to the above medications and COVID-19 were included. Results: A total of 18 articles were included. The use of analgesia, anti-inflammatories, steroids, anticoagulants, antibiotics, vitamin B, vitamin C and vitamin D and their potential impact on COVID-19 patients were reported. Conclusion: Eight main recommendations were derived from the review. Firstly, paracetamol remains the first line of analgesia and antipyretic. Secondly, there is no need to avoid NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, opioids have the potential for immunosuppression in addition to respiratory depression and, therefore, should be prescribed with care in COVID-19 patients. Fourthly, patients with conditions where steroids are proven to be efficacious can continue to receive their steroids; otherwise, systemic steroids are not recommended for COVID-19 patients. Fifthly, orthopaedic surgeons following up on COVID-19 patients who are using steroids should continue to follow them up for possible avascular necrosis. Sixthly, whenever possible, oral anticoagulation should be converted to parental heparin. Seventhly, common orthopaedic antibiotics including penicillin and clindamycin are safe to continue for COVID-19 patients. However, for COVID-19 patients, the antibiotics can potentially be switched to macrolides and tetracyclines if the organisms are sensitive. Lastly, prescription for vitamins B, C and D should continue as per usual clinical practice.",covid
"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has been responsible for thousands of deaths worldwide. Testing remains at a premium, and criteria for testing remains reserved for those with lower respiratory infection symptoms and/or a known high-risk exposure. The role of imaging in COVID-19 is rapidly evolving; however, few algorithms include imaging criteria, and it is unclear what should be done in low-suspicion patients with positive imaging findings. Methods: From 03/01/2020-03/20/2020, a retrospective review of all patients with suspected COVID-19 on imaging was performed. Imaging was interpreted by a board-certified, fellowship-trained radiologist. Patients were excluded if COVID-19 infection was suspected at the time of presentation, was the reason for imaging, or if any lower respiratory symptoms were present. Results: Eight patients with suspected COVID-19 infection on imaging were encountered. Seven patients received testing due to suspicious imaging findings with subsequent lab-confirmed COVID-19. No patients endorsed prior exposure to COVID-19 or recent international travel. COVID-19 was suggested in six patients incidentally on abdominal CT and two on chest radiography. At the time of presentation, no patients were febrile, and seven endorsed gastrointestinal symptoms. Five COVID-19 patients eventually developed respiratory symptoms and required intubation. Two patients expired during the admission. Conclusions: Patients with imaging findings suspicious for COVID-19 warrant prompt reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing even in low clinical suspicion cases. The prevalence of disease in the population may be underestimated by the current paradigm of RT-PCR testing with the current clinical criteria of lower respiratory symptoms and exposure risk.",covid
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, special attention has been addressed in cancer care to mitigate the impact on the patient's prognosis. We addressed our preparation to face COVID-19 pandemic in a Hematological and Stem Cell Transplant Unit in Brazil during the first two months of COVID-19 pandemic and described COVID-19 cases in patients and health care workers (HCW). Modifications in daily routines included a separation of area and professionals, SARS-CoV-2 screening protocols, and others. A total of 47 patients and 54 HCW were tested for COVID-19, by PCR-SARS-CoV-2. We report 11 cases of COVID-19 in hematological patients (including 2 post stem cell transplant) and 28 cases in HCW. Hematological cases were most severe or moderate and presented with several poor risk factors. Among HCW, COVID-19 were mostly mild, and all recovered without hospitalization. A cluster was observed among HCW. Despite a decrease in the number of procedures, the Transplant Program performed 8 autologous and 4 allogeneic SCT during the period, and 49 onco-hematological patients were admitted to continuing their treatments. Although we observed a high frequency of COVID-19 among patients and HCW, showing that SARS-CoV-2 is disseminated in Brazil, hematological patients were safely treated during pandemic times.",covid
"Individuals infected with the novel coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experience many symptoms; however, cutaneous manifestations are relatively rare. The authors encountered three patients with COVID-19 who presented with erythema and suspected viral rash. In all cases, erythema appeared after the onset of the initial symptoms of COVID-19. Erythema was considered to be caused by COVID-19 and not a drug-induced eruption because, in all cases, erythema was relieved merely by external medicine and oral antihistamines, without discontinuing the original medication. The authors' hospital accepted 69 COVID-19 patients between 22 February 2020 and 31 May 2020 and, of these, three (4.3%) exhibited eruptions, and all cases presented erythema. Except for seven patients who exhibited positive nasopharyngeal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA but no symptoms, three (4.8%) of the remaining 62 patients exhibited erythema. Although various types of eruptions have been reported in patients with COVID-19, erythema was the only type in our patients. Erythema in the three patients exhibited many similarities to that previously reported in COVID-19 patients, particularly in the manner it appeared and disappeared. For these reasons, these three cases were considered typical examples of erythema in patients with COVID-19. Considering previous studies and the three cases reported here, there is a high probability that SARS-CoV-2 can cause erythema.",covid
"The COVID-19 infection is increasing at a rapid rate, with the availability of limited number of testing kits. Therefore, the development of COVID-19 testing kits is still an open area of research. Recently, many studies have shown that chest Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used for COVID-19 testing, as chest CT images show a bilateral change in COVID-19 infected patients. However, the classification of COVID-19 patients from chest CT images is not an easy task as predicting the bilateral change is defined as an ill-posed problem. Therefore, in this paper, a deep transfer learning technique is used to classify COVID-19 infected patients. Additionally, a top-2 smooth loss function with cost-sensitive attributes is also utilized to handle noisy and imbalanced COVID-19 dataset kind of problems. Experimental results reveal that the proposed deep transfer learning-based COVID-19 classification model provides efficient results as compared to the other supervised learning models.",covid
"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a novel public health problem threatening the whole world. As an upshot, countrywide lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic has been supportive of changing community mobility trends of various place categories including retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential in India. Objective: To analyze the impact of lockdown for COVID-19 on community mobility using spatial time-series change over different states and union territories (UTs) of India. Data & methods: This study has been organized based on states & UTs wise time-series data of the daily percentage of change of community mobility from baseline in India, collected from 15th February to 30th April 2020. Conditional formatting techniques, time-series trends plotting method, spatial inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation mapping techniques have been employed to show pre and post lockdown mobility trends due to COVID-19 i.e. to fulfill the objective. Results: Across India, retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, visits to parks, transit stations, and workplaces mobility dropped by -73.4%, -51.2%, -46.3%, -66% and -56.7% respectively. Visits to residential places mobility increased by 23.8% as people mostly stayed home during the lockdown. The COVID-19 lockdown started on 24 March 2020 and just gone one day (March 25, 2020) of the beginning of lockdown, there have a decreased in percentage (-70.51% in retail and recreation mobility), (-64.26% in grocery and pharmacy mobility), (-46.17% in parks mobility), (-65.6% in transit stations mobility), (-60.03% in workplaces mobility) from baseline in compared to the pre-lockdown period and residential mobility has been increased in percentage (26.32%) from baseline due to people stayed home during the lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic in India. Conclusion: Study figures out mobility trends over time during pre-lockdown and after lockdown period across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential, which can be used in public health strategies to drop the spread of COVID-19.",covid
"This study aims to develop the expert consensus on nurse's human caring for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in different sites, and thus provide a guideline on providing whole process and systematic caring for COVID-19 patients. Based on the frontline experiences of human caring for COVID-19 patients and the review of literature, the initial draft of consensus was made and finalized after online meeting and revisions. The experts reached consensus on the following parts: terms and definitions, principles of human caring for COVID-19 patients, and human caring measures for COVID-19 patients in different sites. The expert consensus is practical, concise, and reasonable for guiding the nurses providing human caring for COVID-19 patients, as well as other similar infectious diseases.",covid
"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is spread from human to human and has resulted in a global pandemic, posing a disastrous public health risk worldwide. Patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those on dialysis, are considered to be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 due to their immunocompromised status and frail condition. The home treatment setting of peritoneal dialysis (PD) has advantages in terms of implementing self-care when routine hospital visits and social activities are restricted, thus greatly reducing exposure of PD patients to the virus. Methods and results: We outline general operational considerations in PD management during the COVID-19 pandemic, including precautionary measures for PD patients and healthcare staff. Precautionary measures for PD patients include education on prevention of, and screening for, COVID-19, preclinic screening, in-clinic management, meticulous remote patient management and special hospitalization arrangements. The diagnosis and treatment of PD patients with COVID-19 are discussed. Precautionary measures for PD staff include continuous education on, and training in, COVID-19, exposure history surveillance and self-monitoring for COVID-19 among healthcare personnel, appropriate personal protective equipment and hand hygiene, organization of medical activities and staffing, and adequate environment cleaning. Conclusions: This is a battle of the entire human society against the novel coronavirus. Integrated teamwork among healthcare providers, supported by society as a whole, is needed as part of the ongoing public health response to try to slow the spread of COVID-19.",covid
"Tracing and isolation of close contacts is used to control outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. However, risk factors associated with the occurrence of COVID-19 among close contacts have not been well described. A total of 106 household contacts were included in this study, of whom 19 developed into COVID-19 cases, and the secondary attack rate was 17.9%. Multivariable analysis showed that increasing risk of occurrence of COVID-19 among household contacts was associated with female index patients (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 3.84, 95% CI = 1.07-13.78), critical disease index patients (aHR = 7.58, 95% CI = 1.66-34.66), effective contact duration with index patients > 2 days (aHR = 4.21, 95% CI = 1.29-13.73), and effective contact duration > 11 days (aHR = 17.88, 95% CI = 3.26-98.01). The sex and disease severity of index patients with COVID-19 and longer effective contact duration with patients with confirmed COVID-19 could help epidemiologists to identify potential COVID-19 cases among household contacts at an early stage.",covid
"Background and objectives: In the absence of a vaccine or specific drug treatment options for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), attention has been shifted in China to the possible therapeutic use of convalescent plasma. COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) is currently under investigation. We summarized clinical studies and other research data available as of May 5, 2020, on CCP therapy according to the Clinical Treatment Guideline of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma in China, as well as clinical experience at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, as part of a comprehensive anti-epidemic strategy. Materials and methods: As of May 5, 2020, when the epidemic was well-controlled in China, healthcare databases and sources of English literature relating to convalescent plasma were searched and reviewed. Sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity were identified. Results: As of May 5, 2020, up to 2,000 samples of CCP had been collected across China and administered to 700 COVID-19 patients. From donors, 200-400 mL of plasma were collected at each donation, with antibody titers >1:160. We identified three clinical studies for COVID-19 in China. Analyses showed a statistically significant improvement in clinical outcomes compared with untreated cases (P<0.001). No adverse effects were reported. Conclusion: From initial studies, convalescent plasma therapy appears effective and safe for COVID-19. However, there is clearly a need for well-designed RCTs (randomized controlled trials) or other formal studies to further evaluate the efficacy and any potential adverse effects of CCP.",covid
"Background and aims: Tocilizumab (TCZ; interleukine-6 receptor antagonist) has been proposed to treat severe forms of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) because interleukine-6 plays an important role in COVID-19-induced cytokine storm. Several clinical studies have shown very good effects of TCZ in patients with COVID-19, with a few minor side effects reported. Only eight serious liver injuries caused by TCZ were reported before being used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Considering the significantly increased use of TCZ for the treatment of COVID-19, we would like to warn of its rare but possible serious hepatotoxicity, especially when used together with other hepatotoxic drugs. Methods: We describe a patient with COVID-19-induced cytokine storm who developed drug-induced liver injury associated with the use of TCZ. Results: One day after TCZ administration, serum transaminase levels increased 40-fold. Nevertheless, TCZ had a positive effect on clinical and laboratory parameters in cytokine storm, with transaminases values normalizing in 10 days. Conclusions: This is the first reported case of DILI caused by TCZ in a COVID-19 patient. Intensive liver function monitoring is imperative in COVID-19 patients, because of frequent polypharmacy with potentially hepatotoxic drugs.",covid
"Background: Recent news reports state that racial minority groups, such as African-Americans, are experiencing a greater COVID-19 burden, as measured by confirmed cases and deaths. Limited racial data is available on a national level. Methods: We conducted the first nationwide analysis to examine COVID-19 and race on a county level. We obtained datasets on COVID-19 cases and deaths, and racial population totals, by US county. We examined if correlations exist between the racial percentages and percentages of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths by county. Results: A positive correlation existed between percentages of African-Americans living in a county and who have COVID-19 (r = 0.254, P < 0.0001), who have died from COVID-19 (r = 0.268, P < 0.0001), and case mortality (r = 0.055, P = 0.003). Positive correlations also existed between percentages of Asian-Americans living in counties and these factors. Negative correlations existed between percentages of Whites living in counties and these factors. Conclusions: A weak, albeit very significant, positive relationship exists between the percentage of African-Americans living in a county and the percentage of COVID-19 confirmed cases, confirmed deaths and case mortality in the county. This is in support of many city and statewide analyses, and we urge for targeted resources towards work that further examine these racial associations.",covid
"Background: Our aim was to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers (HCW) in a national healthcare system and to understand the risk factors for infection. Methods: The study was conducted at Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar, a national healthcare system with 14 hospitals and >28,000 employees, between March 10-June 24, 2020. Data on COVID-19+ HCW were retrieved from the electronic health records and employment records, followed by an email survey and a focused telephone interview. Results: Among 16,912 HCW tested, 10.6% tested positive. Hospitalization rate was 11.6%, 1.3% required supplemental oxygen, 0.6% needed intensive care unit admission and 0.3% required mechanical ventilation. There were no deaths. In a follow-up survey of 393 HCW, 5% reported acquiring infection at a COVID-19-designated facility and 95% at a non-COVID-19 facility having acquired the infection through accidental exposure to a colleague (45%) or a patient (29%). Full PPE adherence was 82% at COVID-19-designated but only 68% at non-COVID-19 facilities. Conclusions: COVID-19 infection among HCW often occurs among those not directly working with COVID-19 patients. PPE use is less stringent in such settings. Risk of exposure and need for strict PPE must be stressed upon all HCW in all settings.",covid
"A 61-year-old man presented with fever, shortness of breath, and new chest pain. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed Brugada-like ECG pattern. Emergent coronary angiography demonstrated normal coronary arteries. He was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. After a few days he felt better and the ECG Brugada-like pattern resolved.",covid
"Several published and pre-print studies report associations between exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 mortality. While further epidemiological and experimental studies are still needed to prove causality, the association is plausible and consistent with the literature: Air pollution is associated with inferior outcomes in other respiratory infections, may act as carrier for the virus, exerts negative effects on the airways and is associated with cardiopulmonary comorbidities that lead to a poorer prognosis in COVID-19 patients. The lockdown to inhibit the spread of COVID-19 has led to substantial decreases in air pollution levels in many countries.",covid
"We studied the relationship between the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), demographical, and climatological measurements in different regions across the world. Lower solar irradiance and higher population density were independent predictors of greater COVID-19 outbreaks. Further studies on the potential protective effect of sunlight over COVID-19 are warranted.",covid
"Background: Since November 2019, the world has suffered the disastrous consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. No country has been spared either socially or economically. Given the inevitability of the spread of this virus, researches have been active to understand and to counteract the factors that anticipate its spread. In this research, we endorse population density as a catalyst factor for the proliferation of COVID-19 in Algeria. We are interested in the relationship between population density and the spread of COVID-19 in Algerian cities. The latter is characterized by a disparity in the concentration of the population according to the geographic location of each. Results: The cluster analysis allowed us to isolate the groups of cities with the highest numbers of COVID-19 infected cases and the highest population densities. The regression models obtained suggest that there is a strong correlation between the population density and the number of COVID-19 infections in Algeria. This finding is verified by the correlation coefficients. Thus, it is estimated that population density has a positive effect on the spread of COVID-19 in the Algerian context during the study period. Conclusions: The spread of COVID-19 in Algeria is increasing as the population density increases. Once this factor has been demonstrated, the fight against the proliferation of the virus can be thwarted by measures to raise public awareness of social distancing in public places namely supermarkets, markets, and cafes.",covid
"On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the spread of the coronavirus disease, COVID-19, as a pandemic on the basis of ""alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction."" Hence, it is urgent and imperative to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 for as many global locations as possible. This study calculates the relative risk of the importation and exportation of the COVID-19 virus. The study's most important contribution is the calculation of the overall relative risk of the importation and exportation of COVID-19 from every airport in local municipalities around the world, based on global spatial and mapping information. Three scenarios of air travel restriction are considered, and the change in the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19 is calculated. The relative risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19 clearly shows that not only China, Europe, Middle East, and East Asia, but also the U.S., Australia, and countries in northeast Asia and Latin America are subject to risk. Further, a larger reduction in air travel through airports in a large part of the cumulative incidence area would lead to a gradual decrease in the risk flow. Importantly, the exportation risk of the disease from some airports in China, Iran, and European countries has a higher global spread than the importation risk during the pandemic stage. Therefore, every airport, or government with airports in their jurisdiction, should implement strict countermeasures. It is also indispensable for these countries to undertake countermeasures for COVID-19, such as home quarantine within each country and restricting infected or suspected individuals from flying on airplanes.",covid
"Since its eruption in China, novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been reported in most of the countries and territories (>200) of the world with ∼18 million confirmed cases (as of August 3, 2020). In most of the countries, COVID-19 upsurge is uncontrolled with a significant mortality rate. Currently, no treatment effective for COVID-19 is available in the form of vaccines or antiviral drugs and patients are currently treated symptomatically. Although the majority of the patients develop mild symptoms and recover without mechanical ventilation for respiratory management, severe respiratory illness develops in a significant portion of affected patients and may result in death. While the scientific community is working to develop vaccines and drugs against the COVID-19 pandemic, novel alternative therapies may reduce the mortality rate. Recent use of stem cells for critically ill COVID-19 patients in a small group of patients in China and subsequent Emergency Use Authorization of stem cells by Food and Drug Administration to Global Institute of Stem Cell Therapy and Research and Athersys has created excitement among the medical community. As a result, several clinical trials have been registered using stem cells for COVID-19 treatment that aim to use different cell sources, dosage, and importantly diverse targeted patient groups. In this brief review, the possibilities of stem cell use in COVID-19 patients and relevant challenges in their use have been discussed.",covid
"The latest SARS COV2 coronavirus contributes to a pandemic of millions of COVID-19. As there is no defensive immunity in humans and a virus can overcome inborn immune reaction, it can propagate unhindered, mostly in tissues contaminated. No unique therapies for COVID-19 contaminated patients are available at this time. The insights learned from previous respiratory viral infection control have given guidance into COVID- 19 therapy. Several complementary treatments have been tentatively introduced in hospital environments such as immune-modulators, antiviral, convalescent plasma transfusions and natural products. In COVID-19 patients, some of these therapies have provided substantial curative benefits. Moreover, numerous studies and clinical trials are being carried out in order to determine the efficacy of current pharmaceutical and natural products to establish possible therapeutic strategies for producing novel COVID-19 medicines. We summarized and defined the modes of mechanism, protection and efficacy on the existing therapeutic strategies for diseases linked to COVID-19 infection.",covid
"Renal Monomorphology in COVID-19 with Acute Renal Insufficiency Abstract. A 78-year-old ventilator-dependent COVID-19 patient developed severe renal failure with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and nephrotic proteinuria. Sonography showed echo-dense and enlarged kidneys with high resistance indices (>0.8). Echocontrast sonography showed a delayed renal perfusion. In the further course of the disease renal function recovered, kidney size decreased and the renal perfusion normalized. An acute COVID-19-associated interstitial nephritis is postulated.",covid
"Background: The unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on modern society has ignited a ""gold rush"" for effective treatment and diagnostic strategies, with a significant diversion of economic, scientific, and human resources toward dedicated clinical research. We aimed to describe trends in this rapidly changing landscape to inform adequate resource allocation. Methods: We developed an online repository (COVID Trial Monitor) to analyze in real time the growth rate, geographical distribution, and characteristics of COVID-19 related trials. We defined structured semantic ontologies with controlled vocabularies to categorize trial interventions, study endpoints, and study designs. Analyses are publicly available at https://bioinfo.ieo.it/shiny/app/CovidCT. Results: We observe a clear prevalence of monocentric trials with highly heterogeneous endpoints and a significant disconnect between geographic distribution and disease prevalence, implying that most countries would need to recruit unrealistic percentages of their total prevalent cases to fulfill enrolment. Conclusions: This geographically and methodologically incoherent growth casts doubts on the actual feasibility of locally reaching target sample sizes and the probability of most of these trials providing reliable and transferable results. We call for the harmonization of clinical trial design criteria for COVID-19 and the increased use of larger master protocols incorporating elements of adaptive designs. COVID Trial Monitor identifies critical issues in current COVID-19-related clinical research and represents a useful resource with which researchers and policymakers can improve the quality and efficiency of related trials.",covid
"COVID-19 is a pandemic viral disease with catastrophic global impact. This disease is more contagious than influenza such that cluster outbreaks occur frequently. If patients with symptoms quickly underwent testing and contact tracing, these outbreaks could be contained. Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients have symptoms similar to other common illnesses. Here, we hypothesize the order of symptom occurrence could help patients and medical professionals more quickly distinguish COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases, yet such essential information is largely unavailable. To this end, we apply a Markov Process to a graded partially ordered set based on clinical observations of COVID-19 cases to ascertain the most likely order of discernible symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea) in COVID-19 patients. We then compared the progression of these symptoms in COVID-19 to other respiratory diseases, such as influenza, SARS, and MERS, to observe if the diseases present differently. Our model predicts that influenza initiates with cough, whereas COVID-19 like other coronavirus-related diseases initiates with fever. However, COVID-19 differs from SARS and MERS in the order of gastrointestinal symptoms. Our results support the notion that fever should be used to screen for entry into facilities as regions begin to reopen after the outbreak of Spring 2020. Additionally, our findings suggest that good clinical practice should involve recording the order of symptom occurrence in COVID-19 and other diseases. If such a systemic clinical practice had been standard since ancient diseases, perhaps the transition from local outbreak to pandemic could have been avoided.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a life-threatening disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is accounted as global public health concern. Treatment of COVID-19 is primarily supportive and the role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. However, there are no specific anti-COVID-19 drugs and vaccine until now. This review focuses on traditional medicine such as medicinal plant extracts as promising approaches against COVID-19. Chinese, Indian and Iranian traditional medicine, suggests some herbs for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of the diseases including COVID-19. Although, inhibition of viral replication is considered as general mechanism of herbal extracts, however some studies demonstrated that traditional herbal extracts can interact with key viral proteins which are associated with virus virulence. Chinese, Indian and Iranian traditional medicine, suggests some herbs for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of the diseases including COVID-19. However the beneficial effects of these traditional medicines and their clinical trials remained to be known. Herein, we reviewed the latest updates on traditional medicines proposed for treatment of COVID-19.",covid
"We investigated the adoption of World Health Organization (WHO) naming of COVID-19 into the respective languages among the Group of Twenty (G20) countries, and the variation of COVID-19 naming in the Chinese language across different health authorities. On May 7, 2020, we identified the websites of the national health authorities of the G20 countries to identify naming of COVID-19 in their respective languages, and the websites of the health authorities in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Singapore and identify their Chinese name for COVID-19. Among the G20 nations, Argentina, China, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Turkey do not use the literal translation of COVID-19 in their official language(s) to refer to COVID-19, as they retain ""novel"" in the naming of this disease. China is the only G20 nation that names COVID-19 a pneumonia. Among Chinese-speaking jurisdictions, Hong Kong and Singapore governments follow the WHO's recommendation and adopt the literal translation of COVID-19 in Chinese. In contrast, mainland China, Macau, and Taiwan refer to COVID-19 as a type of pneumonia in Chinese. We urge health authorities worldwide to adopt naming in their native languages that are consistent with WHO's naming of COVID-19.",covid
"Purpose: This report describes the development and maintenance of a table to present an assessment of evidence for treatments used in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Summary: AHFS Drug Information (AHFS DI) (American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Bethesda, MD) is ASHP's evidence-based drug compendium that contains drug monographs written for pharmacists and other healthcare professionals. The professional editorial and analytical staff of pharmacists critically evaluate published evidence to develop drug monographs for AHFS DI. In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, these skills were applied to assess emerging evidence for COVID-19-related treatments, and the information was compiled into a new resource for pharmacists and other healthcare professionals to use at the point of care. A list of therapies was developed and prioritized based on review of scientific and public discussions on the use of these therapies in patients with COVID-19; certain therapies used for supportive care and therapies that might theoretically be harmful to patients with COVID-19 also were considered for inclusion. Potential treatments were identified, and the evidence for use in patients with COVID-19 was assessed and summarized in a table format. Information presented for each therapy included the rationale for use, summaries of clinical trials or experience, trial registry numbers, and dosage regimens. Comments on safety and efficacy, including limitations of available data, were presented along with recommendations from recognized authorities. The editorial team continued to add new therapies to the table and update existing entries as new evidence emerged. Conclusion: A comprehensive table that summarized available evidence for potential treatments for patients with COVID-19 was developed.

"Background: With the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak there has been concern that patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who develop COVID-19 may be at risk of greater morbidity and mortality than patients without OSA. COVID-19 is associated with an increased mortality in the elderly and particularly those with obesity, hypertension and diabetes, features which are typically seen in patients with OSA. This article describes the COVID-19 environment in New York City in which patients were evaluated and treated for OSA. Methods: A telephone questionnaire survey of 112 OSA patients determined the occurrence of COVID-19 in the sleep apnea population and the patients' perspective on sleep apnea Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) management during the COVID-19 outbreak. The three main objectives of the survey were as follows: (1) To discover how patients were coping with COVID-19 pandemic in terms of their sleep apnea and PAP use, (2) To determine whether PAP usage changed after the onset of the outbreak in terms of adherence, and (3) To find out if patients were concerned about whether they were at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 because of their sleep apnea and, if they became infected, whether COVID-19 might result in greater complications because of the presence of sleep apnea. Results/conclusions: The adjustment in clinical management of OSA patients is described both during the peak of the outbreak in New York State (NYS), as well as the proposed modifications that will be instituted in order to return to full sleep center activities.",covid

The diagnosis of pancreatitis was based on laboratory as well as radiological evidence, and all the usual etiologies were ruled out. The temporal association with COVID-19 is strongly suggestive of novel coronavirus induced pancreatic injury.",covid
"Coronavirus is an epidemic that spreads very quickly. For this reason, it has very devastating effects in many areas worldwide. It is vital to detect COVID-19 diseases as quickly as possible to restrain the spread of the disease. The similarity of COVID-19 disease with other lung infections makes the diagnosis difficult. In addition, the high spreading rate of COVID-19 increased the need for a fast system for the diagnosis of cases. For this purpose, interest in various computer-aided (such as CNN, DNN, etc.) deep learning models has been increased. In these models, mostly radiology images are applied to determine the positive cases. Recent studies show that, radiological images contain important information in the detection of coronavirus. In this study, a novel artificial neural network, Convolutional CapsNet for the detection of COVID-19 disease is proposed by using chest X-ray images with capsule networks. The proposed approach is designed to provide fast and accurate diagnostics for COVID-19 diseases with binary classification (COVID-19, and No-Findings), and multi-class classification (COVID-19, and No-Findings, and Pneumonia). The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.24%, and 84.22% for binary class, and multi-class, respectively. It is thought that the proposed method may help physicians to diagnose COVID-19 disease and increase the diagnostic performance. In addition, we believe that the proposed method may be an alternative method to diagnose COVID-19 by providing fast screening.",covid
"While Okinawa has been facing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare collapse should be prevented by sufficient supply of ventilators for caring the rapidly growing number of critically ill patients with COVID-19. We estimated the number of invasive and noninvasive ventilators that would be required in Okinawa at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak based on recent data of COVID-19 cases in Okinawa and data on the proportion of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU requiring ventilation. Based on our results using the current supply of all ventilators, demand for ventilators could be prepared for patients with COVID-19 who would require it and demand for noninvasive ventilators could also be prepared for those with COVID-19 who would require it. The higher supply over the demand would be achieved by flattening the epidemic curve by implementing public health interventions to delay and suppress the epidemic peak in Okinawa.",covid
"Background and objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that cardiovascular diseases carry a higher risk of mortality. Doubts have been raised regarding lipid therapy in these patients. The objectives are to analyze the efficacy and safety of lipid lowering therapy in patients with COVID-19. Material and methods: A review of the scientific literature was conducted in PubMed, CDC Reports, NIH, and NCBI SARS-CoV-2 using the keywords: COVID-2, statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, hypercholesterolemia, and hypolipidemic drugs. Results: The statins should continue to use patients with COVID-19 based on their efficacy, safety, immunosuppressive effects, anti-inflammatory availability and accessibility. Depending on the cardiovascular risk levels of these patients, the use of high potency statins and/or ezetimibe and/or iPCSK9 may be necessary in patients with high and very high cardiovascular risk. Patients treated with iPCSK9 should continue treatment for its beneficial effects in preventing cardiovascular disease. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and COVID-19 are especially vulnerable to cardiovascular disease and should continue to receive severe lipid lowering therapy. Conclusions: In patients with COVID-19, the majority of baseline CVDs are of atherosclerotic origin, with the worst prediction for patients with high risk and very high risk of CVD. In these patients, intensive treatment with statins and/or fixed combination with ezetimibe and/or iPCSK9 plays a fundamental role.",covid
"Background: The Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities (CLaRO) supports and facilitates research addressing substance abuse, violence/trauma, and HIV/AIDS among diverse and underserved Latinx populations. CLaRO runs a pilot awards program for early-stage investigators conducting Latinx health disparities research. This pilot awards program was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating innovative responses for research continuity. Purpose: The purpose of this commentary is to describe the challenges and innovative research methods developed in response to COVID-19 to continue Latinx health disparities research in the context of COVID-19. Methods/results: This commentary provides a brief description of each CLaRO pilot project, the challenges introduced by COVID-19, and innovative research methods to continue Latinx health disparities research during and beyond COVID-19. Conclusions: Despite the challenges COVID-19 presents to the continuity of health disparities research, it also presents unprecedented opportunities to innovate. Such innovation is essential for solving persistent scientific, public health, and clinical challenges underlying current and emerging health disparities.",covid
"Reducing personal contacts is a central measure against the spreading of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This troubles mental health, but also mental health care as treatments usually take place in personal contact and switching to remote treatments might be necessary in times of COVID-19. The present study investigated the question how the provision of psychotherapy changed in the early weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and whether there were differences between the four therapeutic orientations eligible in Austria (psychodynamic, humanistic, systemic, behavioral). Psychotherapists (N = 1547) completed an online survey. They entered their number of patients treated on average per week (in personal contact, via telephone, via Internet) in the early weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria as well as (retrospectively) in the months before. The number of patients treated on average per week in personal contact decreased (on average 81%; p < 0.001), whereas the number of patients treated on average per week via telephone and via Internet increased (on average 979% and 1561%; both p < 0.001). Yet, the decrease of psychotherapies through personal contact was not compensated for by increases of remote psychotherapies (p < 0.001). No differences between the four therapeutic orientations emerged. Results imply an undersupply of psychotherapy in the COVID-19 lockdown and that further changes are necessary to cover the increased need for timely psychotherapy in times of COVID-19.",covid
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) which rapidly evolved from an outbreak in Wuhan, China into a pandemic that has resulted in over millions of infections and over hundreds of thousands of mortalities worldwide. Various coagulopathies have been reported in association with COVID-19, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), local microthrombi, venous thromboembolism (VTE), arterial thrombotic complications, and thrombo-inflammation. There is a plethora of publications and conflicting data on hematological and hemostatic derangements in COVID-19 with some data suggesting the link to disease progress, severity and/or mortality. There is also growing evidence of potentially useful clinical biomarkers to predict COVID-19 progression and disease outcomes. Of those, a link between thrombocytopenia and COVID-19 severity or mortality was suggested. In this opinion report, we examine the published evidence of hematological and hemostatic laboratory derangements in COVID-19 and the interrelated SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation, with a focussed discussion on platelet count alterations. We explore whether thrombocytopenia could be a potential disease biomarker and we provide recommendations for future studies in this regard.",covid
"Reports on COVID-19 from the Spanish Health Ministry are valuable, but incomplete, with the perverse effect that the susceptibility to COVID-19 by sex is unclear. Prevalence of COVID-19 by sexes differs between countries. The trend in Spain shows an unequal pattern, initially more frequent in men, but women outnumbered them from March 31, after two weeks lockdown. Infections are more frequent in women than in men in close contact with probable/confirmed COVID-19 cases. Consistent with deaths in men, they are hospitalized more frequently than women: Significant gender differences in signs/symptoms can drive this pattern, already observed in other pathologies. In late April, excess mortality is the same in women (67%) than in men (66%). But, lack of exhaustive information on deaths from COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients may contribute to lower notification of deaths in women. Invisibility of data by sex and gender is probably affecting negatively women with COVID -19 more than men.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infective disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Previous studies of the COVID-19 pneumonia outbreak were based on information from the general population. Limited data are available for hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. This report describes the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in an in-center hemodialysis patient, as well as our experience in implementing steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pneumonia among in-center hemodialysis patients. The diagnosis, infection control, and treatment of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients are discussed in this report, and we conclude with recommendations for how a dialysis facility can respond to COVID-19 based on our experiences.",covid
"To forecast the COVID-19 epidemic trend in Iran, a set of dynamic models were created. In these models, the effect of climate and community behavior change on the reproductive number is modeled. A baseline scenario is also defined as letting the epidemic grow naturally, with no prevention/control interventions. Different levels of intervention are also defined based on the extent of population isolation. Outcomes of each scenario on the number of infected cases are computed. Modeling results shows that if effective isolation occurs in 10% of the population, 307,000 individuals will be infected with COVID-19 in Iran by May 20, 2020. For an isolation rate of 25%, started since March 10, 2020, cumulative number of deaths will be 13,450 individuals by May 20, 2020. If preventive efforts can reach a 32% effective isolation rate, a considerable decrease in the number of new cases would be expected during April and May, and the total number of deaths would decrease to 8,630. If the isolation rate increases to 40%, the total number of infected individuals is expected to be 6,030 individuals. It should be acknowledged that this model predicts the number of deaths of all COVID-19 cases, including those who will not be confirmed as COVID-19, because of non-testing or death prior to COVID-19 identification. This serious health issue requires both long-term and short-term planning and arrangements. Social distancing, and identification and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases are believed to be the most important and effective control measure, and should be strengthened soon.

"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea in January 2020, many South Korean employees have been experiencing work stressors, threats of job insecurity, and feelings of isolation, which together lead to emotional exhaustion. The present study aimed to compare the emotional exhaustion of South Korean employees before and after the pandemic, as well as to examine how the demographic characteristics of employees affected their emotional exhaustion. We administered surveys to 276 employees before the COVID-19 pandemic (from July to October 2019) and 301 employees after its onset (from March to April 2020). A series of t-tests demonstrated that both employee samples were similar demographically. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that even when controlling for baseline emotions, the employees assessed after the COVID-19 experienced significantly higher emotional exhaustion than those assessed before. Furthermore, in reaction to COVID-19, female employees felt more emotionally exhausted than their male counterparts. Finally, after the COVID-19 pandemic, younger and short-tenured employees reported higher emotional exhaustion than older and more experienced employees. These findings provide insight into managing the mental health of employees during the COVID-19 crisis. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The emotional exhaustion of the South Korean workforce increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. After the pandemic, female employees experienced a higher level of emotional exhaustion than their male counterparts. After the pandemic, younger and short-tenured employees experienced a higher level of emotional exhaustion than older and long-tenured employees.",covid
"Background: ADHD limits the ability to comply with Covid-19 prevention recommendations. We hypothesized that ADHD constitutes a risk factor for Covid-19 infection and that pharmacotherapy may lower that risk. Methods: Study population included all subjects (N = 14,022) registered with Leumit Health Services between February 1st and April 30, 2020, who underwent at least one Covid-19 test. Data were collected from the electronic health records. Purchasing consecutively at least three ADHD-medication-prescriptions during past year was considered drug-treatment. Results: A total of 1,416 (10.1%) subjects (aged 2 months-103 years) were Covid-19-positive.They were significantly younger, and had higher rates of ADHD (adjOR 1.58 (95% CI 1.27-1.96, p < .001) than Covid-19-negative subjects. The risk for Covid-19-Positive was higher in untreated-ADHD subjects compared to non-ADHD subjects [crudeOR 1.61 (95% CI 1.36-1.89, p < .001)], while no higher risk was detected in treated ones [crudeOR 1.07 (95% CI 0.78-1.48, p = .65)]. Conclusion: Untreated ADHD seems to constitute a risk factor for Covid-19 infection while drug-treatment ameliorates this effect.",covid
"Background and aims: Covid-19 virus started from Wuhan, China and has brought the world down to its knees. It has catapulted as a venomous global phenomenon. This study focuses on the Covid-19 situation in India and its recovery time. Method: The study period is from March 1, 2020 to April 25, 2020. A random sample of 221 individuals found positive with Covid-19 from March 1, 2020 to 31st March is included in the study which is followed up April 25, 2020. There is a male preponderance in the sample with 66% of the Covid-19 patients being male and about 34% being female. Kaplan-Meier Product limit estimator, Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Log-rank test are used to analyze the recovery time of Covid-19 patients. Result: From the results of the study, it is found that the average recovery time of Covid-19 patients in India is 25 days (95% C.I. 16 days to 34 days). Only 4% of the patients get cured after 10 days of treatment. The recovery time of male and female patients is not statistically different. Recovery time of patients belonging to different age groups is also not statistically significant. Conclusion: This information on recovery time of Covid-19 patients will help planners to chalk out effective strategies.",covid
"Importance: It has been hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may make patients more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to worse outcomes through upregulation of the functional receptor of the virus, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Objective: To examine whether use of ACEI/ARBs was associated with COVID-19 diagnosis and worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Design, setting, and participants: To examine outcomes among patients with COVID-19, a retrospective cohort study using data from Danish national administrative registries was conducted. Patients with COVID-19 from February 22 to May 4, 2020, were identified using ICD-10 codes and followed up from day of diagnosis to outcome or end of study period (May 4, 2020). To examine susceptibility to COVID-19, a Cox regression model with a nested case-control framework was used to examine the association between use of ACEI/ARBs vs other antihypertensive drugs and the incidence rate of a COVID-19 diagnosis in a cohort of patients with hypertension from February 1 to May 4, 2020. Exposures: ACEI/ARB use was defined as prescription fillings 6 months prior to the index date. Main outcomes and measures: In the retrospective cohort study, the primary outcome was death, and a secondary outcome was a composite outcome of death or severe COVID-19. In the nested case-control susceptibility analysis, the outcome was COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: In the retrospective cohort study, 4480 patients with COVID-19 were included (median age, 54.7 years [interquartile range, 40.9-72.0]; 47.9% men). There were 895 users (20.0%) of ACEI/ARBs and 3585 nonusers (80.0%). In the ACEI/ARB group, 18.1% died within 30 days vs 7.3% in the nonuser group, but this association was not significant after adjustment for age, sex, and medical history (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.67-1.03]). Death or severe COVID-19 occurred in 31.9% of ACEI/ARB users vs 14.2% of nonusers by 30 days (adjusted HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.89-1.23]). In the nested case-control analysis of COVID-19 susceptibility, 571 patients with COVID-19 and prior hypertension (median age, 73.9 years; 54.3% men) were compared with 5710 age- and sex-matched controls with prior hypertension but not COVID-19. Among those with COVID-19, 86.5% used ACEI/ARBs vs 85.4% of controls; ACEI/ARB use compared with other antihypertensive drugs was not significantly associated with higher incidence of COVID-19 (adjusted HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.80-1.36]). Conclusions and relevance: Prior use of ACEI/ARBs was not significantly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis among patients with hypertension or with mortality or severe disease among patients diagnosed as having COVID-19. These findings do not support discontinuation of ACEI/ARB medications that are clinically indicated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Introduction: The transmission of COVID-19 virus since the outbreak of viral pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 gave rise to protective operative measures. Aerosol generating procedures such as laparoscopic surgery are known to be associated with increased risks of viral transmission to the healthcare workers. The safety of laparoscopy during the pandemic was then debated. We aimed to systematically review the literature regarding the safe use of laparoscopy during COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic search using PubMed and ScienceDirect databases from inception to 1st May, 2020. The following search terms were used: ''laparoscopic surgery and COVID-19''; ''minimally invasive surgery and COVID-19''. Search items were considered from the nature of the articles, date of publication, aims and findings in relation to use of laparoscopic surgery during COVID-19. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO register for systematic reviews (CRD42020183432). Results: Altogether, 174 relevant citations were identified and reviewed for this study, of which 22 articles were included. The analysis of the findings in relation to laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic were presented in tabular form. We completed the common recommendations for performing laparoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic in forms of pre-, intra- and postoperative phases. Conclusion: There is no scientific evidence to date for the transmission of COVID-19 by laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopy can be used with precautions because of its benefits compared to open surgery. If safe, conservative management is the primary alternative during the pandemic. We concluded that recommended precautions should be respected while performing laparoscopy during the pandemic.",covid
"Since the start of the SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak in China in December 2019 COVID‐19 has affected nearly 4,5 million people around the world, with almost 286,000 fatalities reported as of the current date(1). The World Health Organization declared COVID‐19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30th, 2020 and on March 11th COVID‐19 was declared a pandemic disease(2). In Spain, first cases were diagnosed in early February, with the incidence peak occurring between the last week of March and the first week of April. At the time of writing this article 227,000 patients were infected and 26,000 patients had died of COVID‐19(1). The rapid spread of the virus and the severity of the disease has been a real challenge to the health systems of most affected countries, compelling to the transformation of hospitals in COVID‐19 monographic centres. In order to cover COVID‐19 overwhelming necessities, non‐COVID activity was reduced to the minimum, cancelling non‐urgent surgery, outpatient clinics and treatments, and diagnostic tests.",covid
"Objective: SARS-CoV-2 infection and its oft-associated illness COVID-19 may lead to neuropsychological deficits, either through direct mechanisms (i.e., neurovirulance) or indirect mechanisms, most notably complications caused by the virus (e.g., stroke) or medical procedures (e.g., intubation). The history of past human coronavirus outbreaks resulting in similar health emergencies suggests there will be a substantial prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among COVID-19 survivors. To prepare neuropsychologists for the difficult task of differentiating PTSD-related from neuropathology-related deficits in the oncoming wave of COVID-19 survivors, we integrate research across a spectrum of related areas. Methods: Several areas of literature were reviewed: psychiatric, neurologic, and neuropathological outcomes of SARS and MERS patients; neurological outcomes in COVID-19 survivors; PTSD associated with procedures common to COVID-19 patients; and differentiating neuropsychological deficits due to PTSD from those due to acquired brain injuries in other patient groups. Conclusions: Heightened risk of PTSD occurred in MERS and SARS survivors. While data concerning COVID-19 is lacking, PTSD is known to occur in patient groups who undergo similar hospital courses, including ICU survivors, patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated, and those that experience delirium. Research with patients who develop PTSD in the context of mild traumatic brain injury further suggests that PTSD may account for some or all of a patient's subjective cognitive complaints and neuropsychological test performance. Recommendations are provided for assessing PTSD in the context of COVID-19.",covid
"Understanding the immunological behavior of COVID-19 cases at molecular level is essential for therapeutic development. In this study, multi-omics and systems pharmacology analyses were performed to unravel the multi-targeted mechanisms of novel bioactives to combat COVID-19. Immuno-transcriptomic dataset of healthy controls and COVID-19 cases was retrieved from ArrayExpress. Phytocompounds from ethnobotanical plants were collected from PubChem. Differentially expressed 98 immune genes associated with COVID-19 were derived through NetworkAnalyst 3.0. Among 259 plant derived compounds, 154 compounds were targeting 13 COVID-19 immune genes involved in diverse signaling pathways. In addition, pharmacological properties of these phytocompounds were compared with COVID-19 drugs prescribed by WHO, and 25 novel phytocompounds were found to be more efficient with higher bioactive scores. The current study unravels the virogenomic signatures which can serve as therapeutic targets and identified phytocompounds with anti-COVID-19 efficacy. However, further experimental validation is essential to bring out these molecules as commercial drug candidates.",covid
"Deep learning models are widely used in the automatic analysis of radiological images. These techniques can train the weights of networks on large datasets as well as fine tuning the weights of pre-trained networks on small datasets. Due to the small COVID-19 dataset available, the pre-trained neural networks can be used for diagnosis of coronavirus. However, these techniques applied on chest CT image is very limited till now. Hence, the main aim of this paper to use the pre-trained deep learning architectures as an automated tool to detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 in chest CT. A DenseNet201 based deep transfer learning (DTL) is proposed to classify the patients as COVID infected or not i.e. COVID-19 (+) or COVID (-). The proposed model is utilized to extract features by using its own learned weights on the ImageNet dataset along with a convolutional neural structure. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the propose DTL model on COVID-19 chest CT scan images. Comparative analyses reveal that the proposed DTL based COVID-19 classification model outperforms the competitive approaches.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",covid
"Since the COVID-19 infection first appeared in December 2019, patient profile of outpatient and inpatient clinics has changed. Various cutaneous findings associated with COVID-19 have been reported in the literature. The main objective of this study was to describe and analyze the profile of the consultations requested from dermatology department during the COVID pandemic. Retrospective, cohort study. In this study, we observed the dermatology consultations of the hospitalized patients over a period of 2 months, corresponding to the peak of COVID outbreak in a tertiary care hospital in Turkey. We reviewed the inpatient dermatology consult database retrospectively. Both pediatric and adult dermatology inpatient consultations were evaluated. A total of 166 inpatient dermatology consultations were requested from dermatology department during March-May, 2020. The mean age of the patients was 53.12 (1-89) years. Almost 32.5% (n = 54) of dermatology consultations were requested from the COVID wards and the COVID intensive care unit. The second most common consultations were requested from internal medicine departments (n = 46, 27.7%). The most common indications for the consultations were cutaneous infections (36%), followed by inflammatory disorders (32%), and urticaria (11%). Dermatology consultations have an essential role on the management of hospitalized patients, especially at that pandemic time. Careful dermatological examination improves diagnostic accuracy in skin disorders and skin manifestations of COVID-19 infection that provides an early diagnosis and treatment, helps to improve the quality of the patient care and management.",covid
"Background: Social media platforms have long been recognised as major disseminators of health misinformation. Many previous studies have found a negative association between health-protective behaviours and belief in the specific form of misinformation popularly known as 'conspiracy theory'. Concerns have arisen regarding the spread of COVID-19 conspiracy theories on social media. Methods: Three questionnaire surveys of social media use, conspiracy beliefs and health-protective behaviours with regard to COVID-19 among UK residents were carried out online, one using a self-selecting sample (N = 949) and two using stratified random samples from a recruited panel (N = 2250, N = 2254). Results: All three studies found a negative relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and COVID-19 health-protective behaviours, and a positive relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and use of social media as a source of information about COVID-19. Studies 2 and 3 also found a negative relationship between COVID-19 health-protective behaviours and use of social media as a source of information, and Study 3 found a positive relationship between health-protective behaviours and use of broadcast media as a source of information. Conclusions: When used as an information source, unregulated social media may present a health risk that is partly but not wholly reducible to their role as disseminators of health-related conspiracy beliefs.",covid
"Background: Early studies of patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated markedly dysregulated coagulation and a high risk of morbid arterial and venous thrombotic events. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described in patients with COVID-19, their potential role in COVID-19-associated thrombosis remains unknown. Objectives: To elucidate the potential role of hyperactive neutrophils and NET release in COVID-19-associated thrombosis. Patients/methods: This is a retrospective, case-control study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who developed thrombosis (n=11), as compared with gender- and age-matched COVID-19 patients without clinical thrombosis (n=33). In addition to capturing clinical data, we measured remnants of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, and citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in patient sera. Results: The majority of patients (9/11) were receiving at least prophylactic doses of heparinoids at the time thrombosis was diagnosed. As compared with controls, patients with COVID-19-associated thrombosis had significantly higher blood levels of markers of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil activation (calprotectin). The thrombosis group also had higher levels of D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, and platelets, but not troponin or neutrophils. Finally, there were strong associations between markers of hyperactive neutrophils (calprotectin and cell-free DNA) and D-dimer. Conclusion: Elevated levels of neutrophil activation and NET formation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are associated with higher risk of morbid thrombotic complications. These observations underscore the need for urgent investigation into the potential relationship between NETs and unrelenting thrombosis in COVID-19.",covid
"The scientific literature of coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly expanding. There is a growing evidence on the discrepancy between clinical symptoms and radiologic findings in many patients. This case report gives details about a patient with only mild symptoms but relatively severe radiological findings. The 75-year-old patient suffering from oncologic disease had a planned a F18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron-emission tomography/computer tomography scan with a routine oncological indication where incidental radiomorphologic findings of pneumonia suspect for COVID-19 were detected. After immediate isolation, the patient was transferred to the corresponding medical department, where further investigations verified the diagnosis of COVID-19. With this case, our aim is to raise the awareness for the importance of the instant evaluation of chest computer tomography series when performing planned imaging examination, especially in frail patients. With this practice, potential radiomorphologic findings of pneumonia suspect for COVID-19 could be identified in time, which fundamentally determines further patient management steps.

"The purpose of this paper is to reveal the spread rules of the three pneumonia: COVID-19, SARS and MERS. We compare the new spread characteristics of COVID-19 with those of SARS and MERS. By considering the growth rate and inhibition constant of infectious diseases, their propagation growth model is established. The parameters of the three coronavirus transmission growth models are obtained by nonlinear fitting. Parametric analysis shows that the growth rate of COVID-19 is about twice that of the SARS and MERS, and the COVID-19 doubling cycle is two to three days, suggesting that the number of COVID-19 patients would double in two to three days without human intervention. The infection inhibition constant in Hubei is two orders of magnitude lower than in other regions, which reasonably explains the situation of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei.",covid
"The new coronavirus (COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan city of China in December 2019. Most patients infected with COVID-19 had clinical presentations of dry cough, fever, dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue and malaise, pneumonia, and bilateral infiltration in chest CT. Soon COVID-19 was spread around the world and became a pandemic. Now many patients around the world are suffering from this disease. Patients with predisposing diseases are highly prone to COVID-19 and manifesting severe infection especially with organ function damage such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and death. Till now many drugs have been considered in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, but pharmacotherapy in elderly patients and patients with pre-existing comorbidities is highly challenging. In this review, different potential drugs which have been considered in COVID-19 treatment have been discussed in detail. Also, challenges in the pharmacotherapy of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with the underlying disease have been considered based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of these drugs.",covid
"Background and aims: Meteorological parameters play a major role in the transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. In this study, we aim to analyze the correlation between meteorological parameters and COVID-19 pandemic in the financial capital of India, Mumbai. Methods: In this research, we collected data from April 27 till July 25, 2020 (90 days). A Spearman rank correlation test along with two-tailed p test and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique have been used to predict the associations of COVID-19 with meteorological parameters. Results: A significant correlation of COVID-19 was found with temperature (Tmin), dew point (DPmax), relative humidity (RHmax, RHavg, RHmin) and surface pressure (Pmax, Pavg, Pmin). The parameters which showed significant correlation were then taken for the modeling and prediction of COVID-19 infections using Artificial Neural Network technique. Conclusions: It was found that the relative humidity and pressure parameters had the most influencing effect out of all other significant parameters (obtained from Spearman's method) on the active number of COVID-19 cases. The finding in this study might be useful for the public, local authorities, and the Ministry of Health, Govt. of India to combat COVID-19.",covid
"Background: The Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine has immunity benefits against respiratory infections. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized to have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal BCG childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate, thus allowing us to estimate the BCG's effect without the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. Methods: Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after 1975, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a randomized controlled trial. Results: The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 1·0005 (CI95: [0·8130-1·1881]) and 1·2046 (CI95: [0·7532-1·6560]), allowing us to reject fairly modest effects of universal BCG vaccination. We can reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by 19% and the number of hospitalizations by 25%. Conclusions: While the effect of a recent vaccination must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19 among middle-aged individuals.",covid
"Background and aims: The number of positive and death cases from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still increasing. The identification of risk factors for severe outcomes is important. Dyslipidemia has been shown as a long-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to analyze the potential association between dyslipidemia and the severity of COVID-19 infection. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed database using specific keywords related to our aims until July 9th, 2020. All articles published on COVID-19 and dyslipidemia were retrieved. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 software. Results: A total of 7 studies with a total of 6922 patients were included in our analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that dyslipidemia is associated with severe COVID-19 infections [RR 1.39 (95% CI 1.03-1.87), p = 0.03, I2 = 57%, random-effect modelling]. Conclusion: Dyslipidemia increases the risk of the development of severe outcomes from COVID-19 infections. Patients with dyslipidemia should be monitored closely to minimize the risk of COVID-19.",covid
"The central aim of our study was to widen the mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic by developing and evaluating a measure that could be used to identify the presence of anxiety syndrome features associated with COVID-19. In Study 1, a community sample of 292 participants completed the newly developed COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C-19ASS) and results were subjected to a Principal Components Analysis. An 11-item two-factor structure was identified. In Study 2, a community sample of 426 participants completed a battery of questionnaires including the C-19ASS. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis was performed on the C-19ASS. A 9-item two-factor structure was confirmed. Results also indicated that the C-19ASS has acceptable levels of reliability and concurrent validity. The C-19ASS perseveration factor was found to explain an additional 9.3% variance in COVID-19 anxiety, and additional 2.2% variance in work and social adjustment (functional impairment), over and above all other variables. The C-19ASS appears to be a reliable and valid measure of the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome. The implications of these findings are discussed.",covid
"Rheumatology practice, during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has faced multifaceted challenges. Rheumatologists routinely prescribe immunosuppressant medications to their patients with multisystem autoimmune rheumatic diseases who are concerned about the increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection and are anxious to know if they should continue or hold these medications. Rheumatologists are often inundated by calls from their patients and physician colleagues caring for COVID-19 patients in hospitals, about how to manage the immunosuppression. Physicians face the challenging task of keeping up with the most up-to-date information on COVID-19. There are uncertainties about the mode of spread, clinical features, management options as well as long-term complications of COVID-19. Data are rapidly evolving and different studies on treatment options are showing contradictory results. It is known that viral illnesses can trigger a flare-up of underlying rheumatic disease that was previously in remission. To further complicate the scenario, some of the immunosuppressants have shown to have antiviral properties. This has created dilemma in the light of current COVID-19 crisis, as whether to continue or stop the immunosuppressive agents which could be essential to prevent complications of the rheumatic diseases including organ failure but also there is concern about acquiring COVID-19 or developing serious infection. Until we get an effective vaccine, immunosuppressant management for rheumatic diseases as well as other autoimmune diseases and transplants will pose difficult questions. This article is an attempt to review and understand COVID-19 and its impact on the immune system with special emphasis on managing medications used for autoimmune rheumatic diseases. We have provided general guidance about decision making, in regards to the immunosuppressive agents used in rheumatology practice with an understanding that this may change in near future.",covid
"OBJECTIVE. The virtual imaging trial is a unique framework that can greatly facilitate the assessment and optimization of imaging methods by emulating the imaging experiment using representative computational models of patients and validated imaging simulators. The purpose of this study was to show how virtual imaging trials can be adapted for imaging studies of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), enabling effective assessment and optimization of CT and radiography acquisitions and analysis tools for reliable imaging and management of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We developed the first computational models of patients with COVID-19 and as a proof of principle showed how they can be combined with imaging simulators for COVID-19 imaging studies. For the body habitus of the models, we used the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) model that was developed at Duke University. The morphologic features of COVID-19 abnormalities were segmented from 20 CT images of patients who had been confirmed to have COVID-19 and incorporated into XCAT models. Within a given disease area, the texture and material of the lung parenchyma in the XCAT were modified to match the properties observed in the clinical images. To show the utility, three developed COVID-19 computational phantoms were virtually imaged using a scanner-specific CT and radiography simulator. RESULTS. Subjectively, the simulated abnormalities were realistic in terms of shape and texture. Results showed that the contrast-to-noise ratios in the abnormal regions were 1.6, 3.0, and 3.6 for 5-, 25-, and 50-mAs images, respectively. CONCLUSION. The developed toolsets in this study provide the foundation for use of virtual imaging trials in effective assessment and optimization of CT and radiography acquisitions and analysis tools to help manage the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Probably in the history of medicine, doctors were not as united as they are today, in that fight against COVID-19, when the pandemic spread incredibly fast - from East to West, from North to South. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have unprecedented and unforeseeable consequences, from those on a worldwide/global level to those at the local level - at the level of local communities and families, and individuals (and not just humans, but all other living beings), of which the future will testify in various ways. The consequences will be political, economic, social, but probably to the greatest degree, the consequences of a health nature - systemic and individual. The death toll is high, despite the therapy being applied. We do not currently have a specific and effective therapy against COVID-19. In addition, we do not have a single clinical study that would support prophylactic therapy that could affect COVID-19. All of the therapeutic options now available to us are based on the experience we have gained in treating SARS and MERS. When the vaccine is discovered, at that moment we will be able to say that we have an appropriate and effective method in fighting against COVID-19. Some historians of medicine believe that voluntary vaccination against COVID-19 would be, not only less politically risky but also more effective in protecting the population from coronavirus. It remains to be seen what the new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, announced by WHO experts these days, and which is expected in the fall of 2020, will bring us.",covid
"Background: Recent psychological research into the effects of COVID-19 has focused largely on understanding excessive fear reactions (""over-responses""). Equally important, but neglected phenomena concern ""under-responses"", in which people downplay the significance of COVID-19. People who do not take the pandemic seriously may be less likely to adhere to social distancing policies. The present study is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate the differential predictors of over- and under-responses to COVID-19. Methods: A large community sample from the United States and Canada (N = 6,854) completed measures of beliefs associated with over- and under-responses, along with measures of distress, excessive avoidance, and nonadherence to social distancing. Over-response beliefs were assessed by scales measuring beliefs about the dangerousness of COVID-19 (personal health and socio-economic threats) and COVID-19-related xenophobia (beliefs that foreigners are spreading the virus). Under-response beliefs were assessed by scales measuring beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, and beliefs that one is sufficiently healthy to be robust against the effects of COVID-19. Results: In regression analyses, medium or large effects were obtained whereby over-response beliefs predicted distress (including distress associated with self-isolation) and excessive avoidance during the pandemic, whereas under-response beliefs predicted the disregard for social distancing. Limitations: This study relied on self-reported cross-sectional data and focused on extreme forms of disregard for social distancing guidelines, CONCLUSION: : It is important to understand under-responses to COVID-19 and how these relate to distress, excessive avoidance, and nonadherence to social distancing. Implications for addressing the problems of over- and under-response are discussed.",covid
"The disease COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic. Hyperinflammation and high levels of several cytokines, for example, IL-6, are observed in severe COVID-19 cases. However, little is known about the cellular origin of these cytokines. Here, we investigated whether circulating leukocytes from patients with COVID-19 had spontaneous cytokine production. Patients with hyperinflammatory COVID-19 (n = 6) and sepsis (n = 3) were included at Skåne University Hospital, Sweden. Healthy controls were also recruited (n = 5). Cytokines were measured in COVID-19 and sepsis patients using an Immulite immunoassay system. PBMCs were cultured with brefeldin A to allow cytokine accumulation. In parallel, LPS was used as an activator. Cells were analyzed for cytokines and surface markers by flow cytometry. High levels of IL-6 and measurable levels of IL-8 and TNF, but not IL-1β, were observed in COVID-19 patients. Monocytes from COVID-19 patients had spontaneous production of IL-1β and IL-8 (P = 0.0043), but not of TNF and IL-6, compared to controls. No spontaneous cytokine production was seen in lymphocytes from either patients or controls. Activation with LPS resulted in massive cytokine production by monocytes from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, but not from sepsis patients. Finally, monocytes from COVID-19 patients produced more IL-1β than from healthy controls (P = 0.0087) when activated. In conclusion, monocytes contribute partly to the ongoing hyperinflammation by production of IL-1β and IL-8. Additionally, they are responsive to further activation. This data supports the notion of IL-1β blockade in treatment of COVID-19. However, the source of the high levels of IL-6 remains to be determined.",covid
"To assess the current epidemic trend of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 in India, the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 cases in India in terms of Case Fatality Rate (CFR), Case Recovery Rate (CRR) and Mortality rate (MR) COVID-19 have been evaluated during Lockdown-1. The analysis includes (i) epidemic curve of Covid-19 cases (ii) demographic analysis (iii) calculation of the CFR and CRR by different methods (iv) calculation of MR (v) Geo-temporal analysis (vi) epidemiological transmission factor (vii) evaluation of the effects and impact of infection, prevention and control in India. A total of 10,815 COVID-19 confirmed cases have been reported in 31 states/union territories as of April 14, 2020 with 9272 active cases (85.73%), 1190 cured/discharged (11%), and 353 deaths (3.23%). Among confirmed cases, most cases (59%) are aged 20-49 which is working age in India and 76% cases are reported for men. The median age of Indian COVID-19 patients found to be 39. As of April 14, the CFR per total cases in India is 3.32% and per closed cases is 23.27%. The CRR per total cases in India is 11.00% and per closed cases is 76.72%, which indicates that the recovery rate of COVID-19 is more than the fatality rate in India. The prevention and control measures taken by the state and central governments at all levels and measure of maintenance of social distancing by people have resulted in effective curbing in the COVID-19 transmission in India.",covid
"Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions (OGD) are pathognomonic symptoms in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study reviews the associations of OGD with COVID-19 which will be useful for early diagnosis and self-isolation. Systematic searches of PubMed, Ovid Medline, Scopus, and EMBASE electronic databases were performed. Studies reporting OGD in COVID-19 patients were included. Data were pooled for meta-analysis. The outcomes were odds ratios (OR) of OGD in COVID-19 patients. Proportions of smell and/or taste dysfunctions in the COVID-19 patients were assessed. Fourteen studies (21,515 participants, age 49.12 years, 26% male) were included. The OR of olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients were 11.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.41 to 23.4) when compared with acute respiratory infection (ARI) without detectable virus and 6.46 (95% CI 2.79 to 14.97) in patients with other respiratory viruses. The OR of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients were 11.67 (95% CI 6.43 to 21.17) when compared with the ARI patients without detectable virus and 4.17 (95% CI 1.34 to 12.98) with other respiratory viruses. The OR of gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients were 12.70 (95% CI 7.9 to 20.44) when compared with the ARI patients without detectable virus and 4.94 (95%CI 1.59 to 15.31) with other respiratory viruses. Fifty percent (95% CI 36.7 to 63.3%) of COVID-19 patients had olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunctions. In summary, there are associations between OGD and COVID-19 patients. Patients presenting with ARI should be assessed for olfactory and gustatory functions.",covid
"The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a vast disaster throughout the world. There is increasing evidence that olfactory dysfunction can present in COVID-19 patients. Anosmia can occur alone or can be accompanied by other symptoms of COVID-19, such as a dry cough. However, the pathogenic mechanism of olfactory dysfunction and its clinical characteristics in patients with COVID-19 remains unclear. Multiple cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that the incidence rate of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients varies from 33.9-68% with female dominance. Anosmia and dysgeusia are often comorbid in COVID-19 patients. Otolaryngologists should be mindful of the symptom of anosmia in outpatients so as not to delay the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this paper, we have reviewed the relevant knowledge based on up-to-date literature.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a surge of patients requiring post-acute care. In order to support federal, state and corporate planning, we offer a four-stage regionally oriented approach to achieving optimal systemwide resource allocation across a region's post-acute service settings and providers over time. In the first stage, the post-acute care system must, to the extent possible, help relieve acute hospitals of non-COVID-19 patients to create as much inpatient capacity as possible over the surge period. In the second stage after the initial surge as subsided, post-acute providers must protect vulnerable populations from COVID-19, prepare treat-in-place protocols for non-COVID-19 admissions, and create and formalize COVID-19 specific settings. In the third stage after a vaccine has been developed or an effective prophylactic option is available, post-acute care providers must assist with distribution and administration of vaccinations and prophylaxis, develop strategies to deliver non-COVID-19 related medical care, and begin to transition to the post-COVID-19 landscape. In the final stage, we must create health advisory bodies to review post-acute sector's response, identify opportunities to improve performance going forward, and develop a pandemic response plan for post-acute care providers.

"Objective: In this systematic review, we will discuss the evidence on the occurrence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement and neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19. Methods: MEDLINE (accessed from PubMed) and Scopus from December 01, 2019 to March 26, 2020 were systematically searched for related published articles. In both electronic databases, the following search strategy was implemented and these key words (in the title/abstract) were used: ""COVID 19"" OR ""coronavirus"" AND ""brain"" OR ""CNS"" OR ""neurologic"". Results: Through the search strategy, we could identify two articles about neurological involvement by COVID-19. One of these publications was a narrative review and the other one was a viewpoint. However, the authors scanned the reference lists of the included studies and could identify multiple references. One study, specifically investigated the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and could document CNS manifestations in 25% of the patients. Most of the studies investigated the manifestations of COVID-19 in general. Conclusion: While neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have not been studied appropriately, it is highly likely that some of these patients, particularly those who suffer from a severe illness, have CNS involvement and neurological manifestations. Precise and targeted documentation of neurological symptoms, detailed clinical, neurological, and electrophysiological investigations of the patients, attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from cerebrospinal fluid, and autopsies of the COVID-19 victims may clarify the role played by this virus in causing neurological manifestations.",covid
"Purpose: The study aims to describe the clinical and demographic profile of patients who required vitreoretinal surgeries during the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) lockdown in India. It also reports our operating protocols and initial experience while performing vitreoretinal surgeries during COVID-19 times at a government tertiary eye care hospital. Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional observational study of patients requiring emergent/urgent vitreoretinal surgeries between March 25, 2020 and May 31, 2020. A modified working protocol focussing on the enforcement of standard COVID-19 precautions, OT sterilization, and formation of dedicated infection control and disease surveillance committee was adopted. Patients underwent standard vitreoretinal procedures under general/local anesthesia. Relevant demographic and clinical data were recorded and analyzed. Surveillance data of healthcare workers (HCW) was also analyzed. Results: Eighty six patients were considered for vitreoretinal surgery in this period. Finally, 83 patients underwent surgery. The mean age of the patients was 38.4 ± 20.1 years (Range, 1 month - 75 years). Majority of them were males (66%) and adults (82.6%). Majority of them came from nearby hotspot areas. Most common indications were acute retinal detachment (38.5%) and diabetic vitrectomies (22.9%). Trauma-related cases (14.4%) were less. Surgery was deferred in 3 patients who turned out to be COVID-19 positive. 4 HCWs were quarantined but none of them developed COVID-19 disease. Conclusion: During COVID-19 lockdown, vitreoretinal surgeries were most commonly performed for retinal detachment and diabetic complications. Proper implementation of infection control protocols helps in delivering adequate patient care while ensuring the safety of caregivers during this pandemic.",covid
"COVID-19 outbreak has caused a pandemonium in modern world. As the virus has spread its tentacles across nations, territories, and continents, the civilized society has been compelled to face an unprecedented situation, never experienced before during peacetime. We are being introduced to an ever-growing new terminologies: ""social distancing,"" ""lockdown,"" ""stay safe,"" ""key workers,"" ""self-quarantine,"" ""work-from-home,"" and so on. Many countries across the globe have closed their borders, airlines have been grounded, movement of public transports has come to a grinding halt, and personal vehicular movements have been restricted or barred. In the past couple of months, we have witnessed mayhem in an unprecedented scale: social, economic, food security, education, business, travel, and freedom of movements are all casualties of this pandemic. Our experience about this virus and its epidemiology is limited, and mostly the treatment for symptomatic patients is supportive. However, it has been observed that COVID-19 not only attacks the respiratory system; rather it may involve other systems also from the beginning of infection or subsequent to respiratory infection. In this article, we attempt to describe the systemic involvement of COVID-19 based on the currently available experiences.

"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has swiftly and remarkably altered community mental health service delivery and evidence-based practice (EBP) implementation. This study reports provider perspectives on the impact that COVID-19 had on their work and EBP implementation. Methods: Providers (n = 93) completed online surveys with quantitative measures and open-ended items targeting their responses and/or reactions to COVID-19, and to the transition to providing services via telehealth. Results: Perceptions of personal risk and rumination around COVID-19 were low, while telehealth was viewed positively by providers. Three major themes emerged regarding the major impacts of COVID-19 on work: 1) the altered nature of interactions between patient/client and provider, 2) changes in provider expectations regarding productivity, and 3) challenges maintaining work-life balance. In regard to the major impacts of COVID-19 on EBP implementation, three themes emerged: 1) increased difficulty delivering certain therapies via telehealth, 2) potential limitations to session confidentiality, and 3) challenge of engaging children in telehealth. Conclusions: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, community mental health providers continued to engage with clients and implement EBPs while navigating a number of changes related to the transition to telehealth. This study highlights the need for further work on what supports providers need to effectively engage with clients and deliver EBPs via telehealth and has implications for how telehealth is sustained or de-implemented in response to COVID-19.",covid
"Objective: The objective of this paper is to prepare the government and citizens of India to take or implement the control measures proactively to reduce the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Method: In this work, the COVID-19 outbreak in India has been predicted based on the pattern of China using a machine learning approach. The model is built to predict the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and death cases based on the data available between January 22, 2020, and April 3, 2020. The time series forecasting method is used for prediction models. Results: The COVID-19 effects are predicted to be at peak between the third and fourth weeks of April 2020 in India. This outbreak is predicted to be controlled around the end of May 2020. The total number of predicted confirmed cases of COVID-19 might reach around 68 978, and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 are predicted to be 1557 around April 25, 2020, in India. If this outbreak is not controlled by the end of May 2020, then India will face a severe shortage of hospitals, and it will make this outbreak even worse. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic may be controlled if the Government of India takes proactive steps to aggressively implement a lockdown in the country and extend it further. This presented epidemiological model is an effort to predict the future forecast of COVID-19 spread, based on the present scenario, so that the government can frame policy decisions, and necessary actions can be initiated.",covid
"As the number of COVID-19 cases emerge, new complications associated with the disease are recognized. We present three cases of spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with COVID-19. They show that a pneumothorax can occur during different phases of disease, in patients without a pulmonary disease history and is not necessarily associated to positive pressure ventilation or severity of COVID-19. Although the exact causative mechanisms remain unknown, this observation might imply that extensive alveolar destruction due to COVID-19 may lead to bulla formation resulting in subsequent pneumothorax.",covid
"COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus disease with a higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion. The high pulmonary tropism and contagiousness of the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have stimulated new approaches to combat its widespread diffusion. In developing new pharmacological strategies, the chemical characteristic of volatility can add therapeutic value to the hypothetical drug candidate. Volatile molecules are characterized by a high vapor pressure and are consequently easily exhaled by the lungs after ingestion. This feature could be exploited from a pharmacological point of view, reaching the site of action in an uncommon way but allowing for drug delivery. In this way, a hypothetical molecule for COVID-19 should have a balance between its lung exhalation characteristics and both antiviral and anti-inflammatory pharmacological action. Here, the feasibility, advantages, and disadvantages of a therapy based on oral administration of possible volatile drugs for COVID-19 will be discussed. Both aerosolized antiviral therapy and oral intake of volatile molecules are briefly reviewed, and an evaluation of 1,8-cineole is provided in view of a possible clinical use and also for asymptomatic COVID-19.",covid
"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) arises from the virus SARS-CoV-2 which is similar to the original SARS virus. The most common symptoms of the COVID-19 infection are fever, coughing and shortness of breath. According to the current data, the primary mode of transmission for the COVID-19 virus is between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. The virus may lead to worse respiratory complications, including pneumonia, especially in older patients and patients with pre-existing illnesses, such as cancer. Cancer patients are at a significantly higher risk of getting infected with COVID-19 since their immune system can be compromised and that reality has to do with both that they have cancer and that they are on therapy for their cancer. COVID-19 crisis has impacted every aspect of the practice, including outpatient, elective, wards, emergency care, conferences, teaching and research. We should make sure cancer patients on active treatment are treated appropriately. In this review, we tried to explain how to prevent the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer patients.",covid
"Background/aim: To evaluate the research trends in coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Materials and methods: A bibliometric analysis was performed using a machine learning bibliometric methodology. Information regarding publication outputs, countries, institutions, journals, keywords, funding and citation counts was retrieved from Scopus database. Results: A total of 1883 eligible papers were returned. An exponential increase in the COVID-19 publications occurred in the last months. As expected, China produced the majority of articles, followed by the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Italy. There is greater collaboration between highly contributing authors and institutions. The ""BMJ"" published the highest number of papers (n=129) and ""The Lancet"" had the most citations (n=1439). The most ubiquitous topic was COVID-19 clinical features.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the world and now affects more people within the United States than any other country. New York City has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States. Both locally and across the country, there is great concern in our ability to deliver appropriate medical care during this time. Radiation therapy is another essential clinical service that cannot afford to suffer prolonged delays without compromising patient outcomes. Early action and guidance are therefore critical to minimize transmission events and ensure safe and timely delivery of radiation therapy. The New York Proton Center (NYPC) is a high-volume free-standing multi-institutional proton center located in Manhattan.

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented challenge to world health systems substantially increasing hospitalization and mortality rates in all affected countries. Being primarily a respiratory disease, COVID-19 is mainly associated with pneumonia or minor upper respiratory tract symptoms; however, different organs can sustain considerable (if not terminal) damage because of coronavirus. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common complication of COVID-19-related pneumonia and more than 20% of patients requiring ventilatory support develop renal failure. Additionally, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major risk factor for COVID-19 severity and mortality. All these data demonstrate the relevance of renal function assessment in COVID-19 patients and the need of early kidney-directed diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. However, the sole assessment of renal function could be not entirely indicative of kidney tissue status. In this viewpoint, we argument about the clinical significance and the potential relevance of renal functional reserve evaluation in COVID-19 patients.",covid
"Background: By law, covid-19 disease and deaths in workers may lead to coroners' inquests and/or Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigations. Aims: This study assesses the adequacy of these statutory means to yield recommendations for prevention of acquiring covid-19 infection from work. Methods: Covid-19 guidance from the chief coroner and the HSE was appraised, including using Office for National Statistics (ONS) data. Practitioners were asked to estimate the likelihood that covid-19 disease may have arisen from 'near-miss' scenarios. Data from the judiciary and the HSE were analysed. Results: The coroners' guidance allowed a wider range of reports of death than did the HSE and conformed better with ONS data on covid-19 mortality by occupation. In the practitioner survey, 62 respondents considered a higher likelihood that reported covid-19 cases would have arisen from the scenario deemed unreportable as a 'dangerous occurrence' by HSE than the reportable scenario (P < 0.001). On average there was only one coroner's report to prevent future death from occupational disease every year in England and Wales. The HSE dealt with a yearly average of 1611 reports of work-related disease including 104 on biological agents, but has received about 9000 covid-19 reports. Conclusions: Current HSE guidance for reporting work-related covid-19 may miss many thousands of cases and needs further iteration. Coroners have very limited experience of inquiry into occupational disease caused by biological agents compared with the HSE. Concerns regarding national policy such as on protective equipment warrant a full public inquiry.",covid
"COVID-19 'lockdown' policies may have unintended consequences for individuals, households and country economies. Hence lockdown may be unsustainable despite the risk of a resurgence of new COVID-19 infections. The repeal and alteration of lockdown policies mark a symbolic transfer of responsibility for epidemic control from state to individual. This has the potential to catalyse fear, blame and judgement within and between populations. We draw on experience from the HIV pandemic to show that this will worsen during later phases of the pandemic if COVID-19 stigma increases, as we fear it could. We suggest policy recommendations for 'lockdown lifting' to limit COVID-19 stigma. We suggest three policy priorities to minimise potential increases in COVID-19 stigma: limit fear by strengthening risk communication, engage communities to reduce the emergence of blaming, and emphasise social justice to reduce judgement. 'Lockdown' policies cannot continue uninterrupted. However, lifting lockdown without unintended consequences may prove harder than establishing it. This period has the potential to see the emergence of fear, blame and judgement, intersecting with existing inequalities, as governments seek to share responsibility for preventing further Sars-Cov-2 transmission. As we have learned from HIV, it is critical that a wave of COVID-19 stigma is prevented from flourishing.",covid
"Background: There are still many unknowns about COVID-19. We do not know its exact mortality rate nor the speed through which it spreads across communities. This lack of evidence complicates the design of appropriate response policies. Methods: We source daily death registry data for 4100 municipalities in Italy's north and match them to Census data. We augment the dataset with municipality-level data on a host of co-factors of COVID-19 mortality, which we exploit in a differences-in-differences regression model to analyze COVID-19-induced mortality. Results: We find that COVID-19 killed more than 0.15% of the local population during the first wave of the epidemic. We also show that official statistics vastly underreport this death toll, by about 60%. Next, we uncover the dramatic effects of the epidemic on nursing home residents in the outbreak epicenter: in municipalities with a high share of the elderly living in nursing homes, COVID-19 mortality was about twice as high as in those with no nursing home intown. Conclusions: A pro-active approach in managing the epidemic is key to reduce COVID-19 mortality. Authorities should ramp-up testing capacity and increase contact-tracing abilities. Adequate protective equipment should be provided to nursing home residents and staff.",covid
"Introduction: The starting months of 2020 witnessed a global pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in December, 2019 in Wuhan, China and millions of cases and thousands of deaths were reported within five months. Currently, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and computed tomography (CT) are clinically prescribed for COVID-19 detection across the globe. Areas covered: This systematic review is focused on currently used diagnostic methods for COVID-19 detection and their future prospects. Online searches on Google scholar, PubMed and online resources were conducted on the period of year 2017 to mid-2020. Studies investigating laboratory examinations, radiographical analysis, and potential sensors for COVID-19 detection were included. Along with this, the current status of commercially available kits for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus detection is discussed. Expert opinion: The search has identified the potential applications of nucleic acid technology, diagnostics radiology examinations, and in-vitro diagnostic kits in detection of COVID-19 infections. Despite having their own limitations of each technology, the emerging diagnostic technologies for COVID-19 detection along with undergoing clinical trials are summarized suggesting more collaborations and funding are required for fast track clinical trials.",covid
"The rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus around the world poses a real threat to public safety. Some COVID-19 symptoms are similar to other viral chest diseases, which makes it challenging to develop models for effective detection of COVID-19 infection. This article advocates a model to differentiate between COVID-19 and other four viral chest diseases under uncertainty environment using the viruses primary symptoms and CT scans. The proposed model is based on a plithogenic set, which provides higher accurate evaluation results in an uncertain environment. The proposed model employs the best-worst method (BWM) and the technique in order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Besides, this study discusses how smart Internet of Things technology can assist medical staff in monitoring the spread of COVID-19. Experimental evaluation of the proposed model was conducted on five different chest diseases. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model effectiveness in detecting the COVID-19 in all five cases achieving detection accuracy of up to 98%.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection can involve many organs, such as central nervous system, including in relapse. We describe the case of a 64-year-old woman with microbiologically confirmed COVID-19-induced respiratory distress whose treatment resulted in a negative nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) result for COVID-19. However, after a few weeks, relapse occurred, as indicated by symptoms of acute meningoencephalitis. Results of COVID-19 RT-PCR testing from her cerebrospinal fluid, nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspiration specimens became positive again, but COVID-19 serum antibodies were negative. We therefore note that symptoms with neurologic involvement can be one of COVID-19's first presentations, or they can appear at relapse. Regular evaluation of patients during convalescence is therefore necessary.",covid
"The encounter with the rampant novel Corona virus infection has led the healthcare system across the world to update and modify its tools to fight this pandemic. Pregnancy, childbirth and breast feeding are a set of special situations to be dealt in women afflicted with Covid-19. Currently there is no universal consensus on managing the issue of breast feeding with rooming-in of the neonates in women with suspected or confirmed Covid-19. Literature is still evolving with contradictory guidelines from various authorities across the globe. This review intends to analyse the available evidence on managing breast feeding in such women and to derive a practically plausible approach in handling such situations.",covid
"The high prevalence of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and inefficient preventive measures taken to curb the disease are significant public health concerns. Rapid and innovative advances in digital media offer opportunities for health education, which could result in increased preventive behaviors. This study assessed preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 and tested mediation pathways linking four types of digital media consumption (social media, mobile social networking apps [MSNs], online news media, and social live steaming services [SLSSs]) to preventive behaviors, mediated by worry. Results from an online survey (N = 511) revealed that the vast majority (>90 percent) of respondents had very often or always practiced preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 such as washing their hands more regularly with soap and water, staying away from crowded places, and wearing face masks out in public. In addition, COVID-19 information seeking through the four types of digital media was a salient parameter that encouraged people to practice preventive behaviors either directly or indirectly. Specifically, seeking COVID-19-related information on MSNs, SLSSs, and online news media was directly associated with preventive behaviors. Whereas COVID-19 information consumption on social media, MSNs, and SLSSs during the infectious disease outbreak could elicit intense worry and, in turn, increase preventive behaviors. The reasons for and implications of the results are discussed.",covid
"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an extremely complex existential threat that requires cohesive societal effort to address health system inefficiencies. When our society has faced existential crises in the past, we have banded together by using the technology at hand to overcome them. The COVID-19 pandemic is one such threat that requires not only a cohesive effort, but also enormous trust to follow public health guidelines, maintain social distance, and share necessities. However, are democratic societies with civil liberties capable of doing this? Mobile technology has immense potential for addressing pandemics like COVID-19, as it gives us access to big data in terms of volume, velocity, veracity, and variety. These data are particularly relevant to understand and mitigate the spread of pandemics such as COVID-19. In order for such intensive and potentially intrusive data collection measures to succeed, we need a cohesive societal effort with full buy-in from citizens and their representatives. This article outlines an evidence-based global digital citizen science policy that provides the theoretical and methodological foundation for ethically sourcing big data from citizens to tackle pandemics such as COVID-19.",covid

"Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Several dental care facilities in affected countries have been completely closed or have been only providing minimal treatment for emergency cases. However, several facilities in some affected countries are still providing regular dental treatment. This can in part be a result of the lack of universal protocol or guidelines regulating the dental care provision during such a pandemic. This lack of guidelines can on one hand increase the nosocomial COVID-19 spread through dental health care facilities, and on the other hand deprive patients' in need of the required urgent dental care. Moreover, ceasing dental care provision during such a period will incense the burden on hospitals emergency departments already struggle with the pandemic. This work aimed to develop guidelines for dental patients' management during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidelines for dental care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic were developed after considering the nature of COVID-19 pandemic, and were based on grouping the patients according to condition and need, and considering the procedures according to risk and benefit. It is hoped that the guidelines proposed in this work will help in the management of dental care around the world during and after this COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Older adults experience increased risk for suicide compared to the general population, and the circumstances surrounding the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) may potentiate this risk. We discuss how current COVID-19 pandemic-related policies are likely to harm older adults disproportionately. COVID-19 pandemic social distancing policies and ethical guidelines for COVID-19 treatment may exacerbate experiences of social isolation, perceived expendability, and exposure to suffering, which are related to the 3 main components of the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (i.e., thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness to society, and capability for suicide). The COVID-19 pandemic poses a drain on services and has drawn ethical debates about policies around treating younger adults first. These experiences may lead older adults to have reduced access to needed medical and psychiatric services and may convey damaging messages of expendability. Furthermore, the potential prolonged stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may affect neurological, immunological, and health functioning-exacerbating suicide risk. Potential venues to increase treatment options and decrease social isolation are discussed. We acknowledge optimistic effects as well, such as ""pulling together"" as a society and the many valuable ways older adults may contribute during this crisis.",covid
"The pandemic of the Covid-19 virus has become the main issue all over the world. In its current form, the disease is more severe in geriatric cases and individuals with chronic disease, even causing death. In older adults and atypical presentations, testing strategies for Covid-19, potential drug interactions of experimental Covid-19 therapies, and ageism are important issues in the course of the disease. Therefore, health-care professionals should be aware of these, and screening policies for Covid-19 should also include atypical presentations with or without classical symptoms of the illness in older adults. Furthermore, evaluation of individuals > 65 years of age from a geriatrician's perspective is very important, because Covid-19 is severe and fatal in seniors.",covid
"Since December 2019 SARS-Cov-2 was found responsible for the disease COVID-19, which has spread worldwide. No specific therapies/vaccines are yet available for the treatment of COVID-19. Drug repositioning may offer a strategy and a number of drugs have been repurposed, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab. This paper describes the main pharmacological properties of such drugs administered to patients with COVID-19, focusing on their antiviral, immune-modulatory and/or anti-inflammatory actions. Where available, data from clinical trials involving patients with COVID-19 are reported. Preliminary clinical trials seem to support their benefit. However, such drugs in COVID-19 patients have peculiar safety profiles. Thus, adequate clinical trials are necessary for these compounds. Nevertheless, while waiting for effective preventive measures i.e. vaccines, many clinical trials on drugs belonging to different therapeutic classes are currently underway. Their results will help us in defining the best way to treat COVID-19 and reducing its symptoms and complications.",covid
"While we and our patients have many transferences to the modality of video or telephone therapy, these meanings are ultimately not intrinsic to the medium itself. Rather, they are symbolic meanings we make of the modality.

It also explores the clinical opportunities in identifying these dissociated countertransferential experiences and embodying them in our own and our patients' experiences.",covid
"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread world over causing morbidity and mortality in affected patients, especially elderly and those with co-morbidities. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients frequently require immunosuppressive therapy and are known to be at risk of opportunistic infections. Areas covered: We hereby review the available literature pertaining to COVID-19 in IBD based on published consensus guidelines, expert opinions, case series, registries and reports. Expert opinion: Preliminary data suggests no increase in incidence of COVID-19 in IBD patients as compared to general population. Morbidity and mortality rates attributable to COVID-19 are also similar in IBD patients as compared to general population. Though exact reason is unknown, some aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis may explain this paradox. Medications for IBD need to be carefully reviewed during COVID-19 crisis. Steroids may need dose tapering or substitution to avoid complications based on anecdotal evidence. Endoscopic procedures for IBD maybe deferred unless absolutely necessary. General measures recommended for COVID-19 tailored to specific needs of IBD patients maybe the best way to prevent infection. Our understanding of the disease outcomes and optimal management protocols are likely to evolve as we move ahead in this pandemic.",covid
"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in China at the end of 2019. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents the most common and serious complication of COVID-19. Cytokine storms are a pathophysiological feature of COVID-19 and play an important role in distinguishing hyper-inflammatory subphenotypes of ARDS. Accordingly, in this review, we focus on hyper-inflammatory host responses in ARDS that play a critical role in the differentiated development of COVID-19. Furthermore, we discuss inflammation-related indicators that have the potential to identify hyper-inflammatory subphenotypes of COVID-19, especially for those with a high risk of ARDS. Finally, we explore the possibility of improving the quality of monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 patients and in reducing the incidence of critical illness and mortality via better distinguishing hyper- and hypo-inflammatory subphenotypes of COVID-19.",covid
"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a world health emergency. The disease predominantly effects individuals between 30 and 79 years of age with 81% of cases being classified as mild. Despite the majority of the general population displaying symptoms similar to the common cold, COVID-19 has also induced alveolar damage resulting in progressive respiratory failure with fatalities noted in 6.4% of cases. Direct viral injury, uncontrolled inflammation, activation of coagulation, and complement cascades are thought to participate in disease pathogenesis. Patients with COVID-19 have displayed kidney damage through acute kidney injury, mild proteinuria, hematuria, or slight elevation in creatinine possibly as consequence of kidney tropism of the virus and multiorgan failure. The impact of COVID-19 on patients with pre-existing kidney impairment, including those with chronic kidney disease, kidney transplant recipients, and individuals on hemodialysis (HD) has not yet been clearly established. No specific treatments for COVID-19 have been found yet. Research has revealed several agents that may have potential efficacy against COVID-19, and many of these molecules have demonstrated preliminary efficacy against COVID-19 and are currently being tested in clinical trials.",covid
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached a pandemic level. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells through ACE2 receptors, leading to COVID-19-related pneumonia. The rapid increase in confirmed cases makes the prevention and control of COVID-19 extremely serious. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays remain the molecular test of choice for the etiologic diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection while radiographic findings (chest computed tomography [CT]) and antibody-based techniques are being introduced as supplemental tools. Novel virus also cause chronic damage to the cardiovascular system, and attention should be given to cardiovascular protection during treatment for COVID-19. Acute cardiac injury determined by elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels is commonly observed in severe cases and is strongly associated with mortality. This review suggests that cardiovascular comorbidities are common in patients with COVID-19 and such patients are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. The continuation of clinically indicated ACE inhibitor and ARB medications is recommended in COVID-19. We review the basics of coronaviruses, novel molecular targets for the coronaviruses with a focus on COVID-19, along with their effects on the cardiovascular system.",covid
"As the whole world is witnessing what novel coronavirus (COVID-19) can do to the mankind, it presents several unique features also. In the absence of specific vaccine for COVID-19, it is essential to detect the disease at an early stage and isolate an infected patient. Till today there is a global shortage of testing labs and testing kits for COVID-19. This paper discusses about the role of machine learning techniques for getting important insights like whether lung computed tomography (CT) scan should be the first screening/alternative test for real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is COVID-19 pneumonia different from other viral pneumonia and if yes how to distinguish it using lung CT scan images from the carefully selected data of lung CT scan COVID-19-infected patients from the hospitals of Italy, China, Moscow and India? For training and testing the proposed system, custom vision software of Microsoft azure based on machine learning techniques is used. An overall accuracy of almost 91% is achieved for COVID-19 classification using the proposed methodology.",covid
"Objective: Past research has linked older age with greater emotional well-being and decreased reactivity to stressors, but it is unknown whether age-related advantages in emotional well-being are maintained in the wake of COVID-19. We examined age differences in exposure and affective reactivity to daily stressors and positive events in the first several weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: In March and April 2020, 776 adults from Canada and the U.S. ages 18-91 (mean age 45) reported COVID-19 threats at baseline, then completed nightly surveys for one week about their daily stressors, positive events, and affect. Results: Younger age predicted more concerns about the threat of COVID-19 across multiple domains, in addition to lower positive affect, higher negative affect, and less frequent positive events. Younger adults had more non-COVID-19 daily stressors and higher perceived control over stressors, but lower perceived coping efficacy than older adults. There were no age differences in the frequency of COVID-19 daily stressors nor perceived stressor severity. Younger adults had greater reductions in negative affect on days when more positive events occurred and greater increases in negative affect on days when non-COVID-19 stressors occurred. Age moderation was attenuated for negative affective reactivity to COVID-19 stressors. Age did not moderate positive affective reactivity to daily events. Discussion: In the early weeks of the pandemic, older adults showed better emotional well-being and less reactivity to stressors but did not differ from younger adults in their exposure to COVID-19 stressors. Additionally, younger adults benefited more from positive events.",covid
"In order to accurately admit children with COVID-19 to an isolation ward, our study retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of children in isolation wards during the COVID-19 epidemic. It was found that 55 cases (83.3%) had fever and 48 cases (72.7%) coughed in the isolated area, 31 cases (47%) had a history of exposure, 26 cases (39.4%) had a decrease in lymphocytes (LYM), more than half had an increase in lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase isoenzyme, 14 cases (21.2%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, 58 cases (87.9%) had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT), and 11 cases (16.7%) had sinus arrhythmia. Therefore, for some suspected children with COVID-19, we can make a comprehensive judgment through clinical symptoms, epidemiological history, LYM number, myocardial enzyme spectrum, chest CT, and electrocardiogram; put these children in an isolation ward for treatment; and then transfer them to a general ward for treatment after excluding COVID-19.",covid
"Introduction: The fact that little is yet known about the possible implications of COVID-19 for pregnancy, puts pregnant women at greater risk of heightened anxiety and psychological distress. In this study, we sought to explore the psychological distress and COVID-19-related anxiety of pregnant women during the crisis. Methods: Israeli Jewish and Arab pregnant women (n = 336) aged 20-47 completed a set of questionnaires during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Results: The levels of all COVID-19-related anxieties were quite high (much or very much), with the highest regarding public places and transportation (87.5%, 70%, respectively), followed by concerns over the possible infection of other family members and the health of the foetus (71.7%, 70%, respectively), going for pregnancy check-ups (68.7%,), being infected themselves, and the delivery (59.2%, 55.4%, respectively). Although COVID-19-related anxieties were shared by pregnant women characterised by diverse sociodemographic variables, with very small nuances, Arab women were more anxious about each of the issues than Jewish women. Discussion: Our findings highlight the importance of assessing anxiety and distress in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the need to be attentive to the double stress of pregnant women in times of crisis and to the potential vulnerability of subgroups, such as cultural minorities.",covid
"While COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that has spread to all regions of the globe, local historic, health, and socio-environmental factors shape the epidemiological contours, response, and social challenges present within each affected nation. Thus, while countries like China, Italy, Iran, Brazil, and the United States have all been hard hit by the pandemic, there are critical differences across these nations in a number of variables (e.g. demographic features, health histories, healthcare systems, infection case rates, case fatality rates, national responses). In other words, within the global pandemic there are multiple importantly distinct national epidemics. Overcoming the grave threats to public health presented by COVID-19 requires both international cooperation and country-specific efforts that reflect local histories, needs, and resources. Already concerns are being expressed among health officials about how COVID-19 might be devastating in Africa. Currently, South Africa has the highest number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases on the continent and has been identified as being at high risk in the pandemic. This paper examines the public health response to the COVID-19 threat, how the prior and ongoing HIV and TB epidemics shape the COVID-19 epidemic and influence the response, and the potential ramifications of the response.",covid
"Introduction: The current COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a timely response from the healthcare system train a large and diverse group of healthcare workers/responders swiftly. Methods: In order to address this need, we created a downloadable pedagogical video content through first-person point-of-view to rapidly train users on COVID-19 procedures in the Revinax® Handbook mobile App. Eight new tutorials were designed through this technology platform to assist healthcare workers/responders caring for COVID-19 patients. A survey was then sent to assess their interest. Results: In one-month since the App was created, it was downloaded by 12,516 users and a feedback survey determined that the users valued the tutorials in helping them learn COVID-19 procedures efficiently in real-time. The fast-growing number of downloads and positive user feedback evidences that we created a valuable educational tool with an emergent- and growing-demand. Discussion: The 71.48% App user response rate, showed largely positive feedback of the COVID-19 tutorial. The fact that these healthcare workers/responders took the time to complete the survey during a pandemic was indicative of its immediate value. Further, the App users indicated that they FPV tutorial was rather helpful in addressing their training needs regarding their roles in COVID-19 patient care during the pandemic. Conclusion: The tutorials were deployed to offer efficient and rapid global public health educational outreach as a tool to address COVID-19 healthcare training in a timely manner.",covid
"Importance: With the surge in COVID-19 cases worldwide, the medical community should be aware of atypical clinical presentations to help with correct diagnosis, to take the proper measures to place the patient in isolation and to avoid healthcare professionals being infected by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Objective: To report that patients who subsequently test positive for COVID-19 may present with acute abdominal pain and no pulmonary symptoms, although they already have typical lung lesions on computed tomography (CT) scan. Design, setting and participants: This case series is about three patients who presented to the emergency department of a community hospital in Montpellier, France, with acute abdominal pain. Results: The three patients had an elevated C-reactive protein level. CT scans demonstrated no abdominal anomaly, but bilateral lung lesions at the lung bases, typical of COVID-19 lesions, were observed. COVID-19 RT-PCR tests were positive for the three patients.The patients were transferred to the COVID-19 centre for disease control at Montpellier University Hospital. As of 29 March 2020, two of those patients are still intubated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the third was discharged home. Conclusion and relevance: COVID-19 infections may present as an acute abdominal pain. In our case series, CT scan findings helped us to suspect the correct diagnosis, which was subsequently confirmed with COVID-19 RT-PCR tests.",covid
"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected over 2 million people worldwide over the course of just several months. Various studies have highlighted that patients infected with COVID-19 may develop various degrees of liver injury. Here, we discuss the impact of underlying liver disease and manifestations of hepatic injury with COVID-19. We also review mechanisms of hepatic injury. Methods: We searched the database PubMed for all studies focused on hepatic injury in COVID-19. Results: We identified 13 studies that assessed the impact of underlying liver disease in patients infected with COVID-19 (N=3046). Underlying liver disease was one of the most common known comorbid categories in patients infected with COVID-19. Overall, 25% of the patients identified from the 13 studies had hepatic injury. Twenty-one percent and 24% had elevated alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase values, respectively. Nine percent of the patients had elevated total bilirubin values. Ten of the 13 studies assessed COVID-19 acuity with severity of hepatic injury. In 9 of the 10 studies, clinical outcomes were worse with hepatic injury. Conclusions: Liver injury is highly prevalent in patients that present with COVID-19. Since the liver is one of the most affected organs outside of the respiratory system in COVID-19, more intensive surveillance is warranted for severe cases, particularly among those with pre-existing advanced liver disease.",covid
"The possibility to use widespread and simple chest X-ray (CXR) imaging for early screening of COVID-19 patients is attracting much interest from both the clinical and the AI community. In this study we provide insights and also raise warnings on what is reasonable to expect by applying deep learning to COVID classification of CXR images. We provide a methodological guide and critical reading of an extensive set of statistical results that can be obtained using currently available datasets. In particular, we take the challenge posed by current small size COVID data and show how significant can be the bias introduced by transfer-learning using larger public non-COVID CXR datasets. We also contribute by providing results on a medium size COVID CXR dataset, just collected by one of the major emergency hospitals in Northern Italy during the peak of the COVID pandemic. These novel data allow us to contribute to validate the generalization capacity of preliminary results circulating in the scientific community. Our conclusions shed some light into the possibility to effectively discriminate COVID using CXR.",covid
"Background and aims: People with diabetes have multiple psychosocial issues related to diabetes and its complications and this may be exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We reviewed the psychological adaptative difficulties in people with diabetes especially during natural disasters including the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. Results: There are significant concerns regarding worsening of glycemic control, unavailability of appropriate medicines, inaccessibility to health care or acquiring SARS- CoV-2 infection and subsequent poorer outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there are some guidance documents for managing diabetes and associated complications during COVID-19 pandemic but very few address the psychological issues in people with diabetes. We discuss the psychological adaptive difficulties and an approach to address the psychosocial concerns in people with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: People with diabetes have significant diabetes distress and psychological adaptive difficulties that is aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. An integrated multidisciplinary approach is needed to manage the prevailing psychological issues amongst people with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"The non-specific beneficial effects of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination suggest that this vaccine might play a role in protecting individuals against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several studies propose that BCG vaccination may increase the body's immunity, thereby preventing respiratory infections caused by other respiratory pathogens. As the number of deaths due to COVID-19 is increasing rapidly and there is no specific treatment available to date, scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of already approved drugs as therapies against COVID-19, and the results were found to vary widely: from no significant effect being observed to a reduction in the time taken for clinical improvement. This study thus aims to evaluate whether it is worth performing clinical trials to examine the effects of the BCG vaccine on COVID-19. We herein emphasize the need to conduct phase III randomized controlled trials with adequate sample size and quality to investigate the effects of the BCG vaccine on COVID-19. In the event that BCG vaccination provides non-specific protection against COVID-19, administering it could be helpful in controlling the transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases during future pandemics.",covid
"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) seems to be an underdiagnosed complication in COVID-19 patients. We present three male patients, aged 67, 29 and 71 years, who were admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. They all showed deterioration in the course of their disease caused by VTE. In our hospital, VTE was diagnosed in 10% of COVID-19 patients admitted to the general ward (non-ICU patients) despite regular thromboprophylaxis. Deterioration in the course of COVID-19 has differential diagnoses such as progression of the infection itself, secondary bacterial pneumonia, left heart failure and in our experience not infrequently VTE. We therefore recommend to consider VTE in COVID-19 patients with a sudden clinical deterioration such as hypotension, tachycardia, unexplained hypoxaemia or insufficient clinical improvement and to perform CT-angiography if indicated. A high dose of thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 patients may be considered because of increased coagulation activation.",covid
"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020. Approximately 30% of infected individuals are asymptomatic. We present the case of a 68-year-old female who underwent outpatient breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for assessment of a left breast mass. The study demonstrated abnormal sub-pleural high T2 signal intensity change within in the partially visualised lungs, which showed enhancement following administration of contrast. Concern was raised that the pulmonary changes may represent COVID-19 infection. The patient was urgently contacted and denied any current symptoms but reported suffering mild upper respiratory tract symptoms two weeks earlier. An outpatient chest radiograph demonstrated changes consistent with COVID-19 infection and the patient was treated as COVID-19 positive and advised to self-isolate for 7 days as per Public Health England guidance. Due to increasing breathlessness the patient presented to our emergency department the next day and underwent a CT pulmonary angiogram which demonstrated segmental pulmonary emboli and sub-pleural consolidation in keeping with COVID-19 infection. This represents the first case of COVID-19 identified on breast MR imaging that the authors have seen and highlights the importance of prompt identification and flagging of incidental pulmonary findings to minimise further transmission of the virus in asymptomatic carriers.",covid
"With the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the amount of used personal protective equipment (PPE) including face masks and protective clothes has significantly increased. This used PPE in a hospital can lead to the indirect infection by COVID-19. Accordingly, it has been recognized that the management of used PPE is very important to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Through the experience of spreading some infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus in South Korea (Republic of Korea), a safe management method of waste related to infectious diseases has been developed. In addition, regarding waste related to COVID-19, the Ministry of Environment, SK, proposed special measures to strengthen the management process of waste related to COVID-19 based on principles such as sustainability, transparency and safety.",covid
"Current understanding of the impact of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on arrhythmias continues to evolve as new data emerge. Cardiac arrhythmias are more common in critically ill COVID-19 patients. The potential mechanisms that could result in arrhythmogenesis among COVID-19 patients include hypoxia caused by direct viral tissue involvement of lungs, myocarditis, abnormal host immune response, myocardial ischemia, myocardial strain, electrolyte derangements, intravascular volume imbalances, and drug sides effects. To manage these arrhythmias, it is imperative to increase the awareness of potential drug-drug interactions, to monitor QTc prolongation while receiving COVID therapy and provide special considerations for patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes. It is also crucial to minimize exposure to COVID-19 infection by stratifying the need for intervention and using telemedicine. As COVID-19 infection continues to prevail with a potential for future surges, more data are required to better understand pathophysiology and to validate management strategies.",covid
"In this position paper, I examine how the history, philosophy and sociology of science (HPS) can contribute to science education in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. I discuss shortcomings in the ways that history is often used in school science, and examine how knowledge of previous pandemics might help in teaching about COVID-19. I look at the potential of issues to do with measurement in the context of COVID-19 (e.g. measurement of mortality figures) to introduce school students to issues about philosophy of science, and I show how COVID-19 has the affordance to broaden and deepen the moral philosophy that students typically meet in biology lessons. COVID-19 also provides opportunities to introduce students to sociological ways of thinking, examining data and questioning human practices. It can also enable students to see how science, economics and politics inter-relate. In the final part of the paper, I suggest that there are strong arguments in favour of an interdisciplinary approach in tackling zoonoses like COVID-19 and that there is much to be said for such interdisciplinarity in school science lessons when teaching about socio-scientific issues and issues intended to raise scientific literacy.",covid
"This paper analyzes the insurability of pandemic risk and outlines how underwriting policies and scenario analysis are used to build resilience upfront and plan contingency actions for crisis scenarios. It then summarizes the unique ""lessons learned"" from the Covid-19 crisis by baselining actual developments against a reasonable, pre-Covid-19 pandemic scenario based on the 2002 SARS epidemic and 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. Actual developments support the pre-Covid-19 hypothesis that financial market developments dominate claims losses due to the demographics of pandemics and other factors. However, Covid-19 ""surprised"" relative to the pre-Covid-19 scenario in terms of its impact on the real economy as well as on the property and casualty segment as business interruption property triggers and exclusions are challenged, something that may adversely impact the insurability of pandemics as well as the perception of the industry for some time to come. The unique lessons of Covid-19 reinforce the need for resilience upfront in solvency and liquidity, the need to improve business interruption wordings and re-underwrite the book, and the recognition that business interruption caused by pandemics may not be an insurable risk due to its large accumulation potential and the threat of external moral hazard. These insurability limitations lead to a discussion about the structure and financing of protection against the impact of future pandemics.",covid
"Fast diagnostic methods can control and prevent the spread of pandemic diseases like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and assist physicians to better manage patients in high workload conditions. Although a laboratory test is the current routine diagnostic tool, it is time-consuming, imposing a high cost and requiring a well-equipped laboratory for analysis. Computed tomography (CT) has thus far become a fast method to diagnose patients with COVID-19. However, the performance of radiologists in diagnosis of COVID-19 was moderate. Accordingly, additional investigations are needed to improve the performance in diagnosing COVID-19. In this study is suggested a rapid and valid method for COVID-19 diagnosis using an artificial intelligence technique based. 1020 CT slices from 108 patients with laboratory proven COVID-19 (the COVID-19 group) and 86 patients with other atypical and viral pneumonia diseases (the non-COVID-19 group) were included. Ten well-known convolutional neural networks were used to distinguish infection of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups: AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and Xception. Among all networks, the best performance was achieved by ResNet-101 and Xception. ResNet-101 could distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases with an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 99.02%; accuracy, 99.51%). Xception achieved an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 98.04%; specificity, 100%; accuracy, 99.02%). However, the performance of the radiologist was moderate with an AUC of 0.873 (sensitivity, 89.21%; specificity, 83.33%; accuracy, 86.27%). ResNet-101 can be considered as a high sensitivity model to characterize and diagnose COVID-19 infections, and can be used as an adjuvant tool in radiology departments.",covid
"SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread worldwide. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic (1). That same day, the first confirmed COVID-19-associated fatality occurred in New York City (NYC). To identify confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, defined as those occurring in persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, on March 13, 2020, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) initiated a daily match between all deaths reported to the DOHMH electronic vital registry system (eVital) (2) and laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. Deaths for which COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, or an equivalent term is listed on the death certificate as an immediate, underlying, or contributing cause of death, but that do not have laboratory-confirmation of COVID-19 are classified as probable COVID-19-associated deaths. As of May 2, a total of 13,831 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated deaths, and 5,048 probable COVID-19-associated deaths were recorded in NYC (3). Counting only confirmed or probable COVID-19-associated deaths, however, likely underestimates the number of deaths attributable to the pandemic. The counting of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths might not include deaths among persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection who did not access diagnostic testing, tested falsely negative, or became infected after testing negative, died outside of a health care setting, or for whom COVID-19 was not suspected by a health care provider as a cause of death. The counting of confirmed and probable COVID-19-associated deaths also does not include deaths that are not directly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective of this report is to provide an estimate of all-cause excess deaths that have occurred in NYC in the setting of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Excess deaths refer to the number of deaths above expected seasonal baseline levels, regardless of the reported cause of death. Estimation of all-cause excess deaths is used as a nonspecific measure of the severity or impact of pandemics (4) and public health emergencies (5). Reporting of excess deaths might provide a more accurate measure of the impact of the pandemic.",covid
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, a novel coronavirus from the same family as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, has spread worldwide leading the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents flu-like symptoms which can become serious in high-risk individuals. Here, we provide an overview of the known clinical features and treatment options for COVID-19. We carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase and Web of Science) with the following keywords: 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', 'coronavirus' and 'SARS-CoV-2'. We included publications from 1 January 2019 to 3 April 2020 which focused on clinical features and treatments. We found that infection is transmitted from human to human and through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Hand hygiene is fundamental to prevent contamination. Wearing personal protective equipment is recommended in specific environments. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal issues. Real-time PCR is used as a diagnostic tool using nasal swab, tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Computed tomography findings are important for both diagnosis and follow-up. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and respiratory therapy. In conclusion, although many therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate. Specifically designed randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the most appropriate evidence-based treatment modality.",covid
"Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is rapidly spreading across the world. As of March 26, 2020, there are more than 500,000 cases and more than 25,000 deaths related to COVID-19, and the numbers are increasing by the hour. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases in North Carolina, and to understand patterns in virtual visits related to symptoms of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a cohort study of confirmed COVID-19 cases and patients using an on-demand, statewide virtual urgent care center. We collected data from February 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020. Institutional Review Board exemption was obtained prior to the study. Results: As of March, 18 2020, there were 92 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 733 total virtual visits. Of the total visits, 257 (35.1%) were related to COVID-19-like symptoms. Of the COVID-19-like visits, the number of females was 178 (69.2%). People in the age groups of 30-39 years (n=67, 26.1%) and 40-49 years (n=64, 24.9%) were half of the total patients. Additionally, approximately 96.9% (n=249) of the COVID-like encounters came from within the state of North Carolina. Our study shows that virtual care can provide efficient triaging in the counties with the highest number of COVID-19 cases. We also confirmed that the largest spread of the disease occurs in areas with a high population density as well as in areas with major airports. Conclusions: The use of virtual care presents promising potential in the fight against COVID-19. Virtual care is capable of reducing emergency room visits, conserving health care resources, and avoiding the spread of COVID-19 by treating patients remotely. We call for further adoption of virtual care by health systems across the United States and the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Background and purpose: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents an unprecedented health crisis to the entire world. As reported, the body mass index (BMI) may play an important role in COVID-19; however, this still remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the association between BMI and COVID-19 severity and mortality. Methods: The Medline, PubMed, Embase and Web of science were systematically searched until August 2020. Random-effects models and dose-response meta-analysis were used to synthesize the results. Combined odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and the effect of covariates were analyzed using subgroup analysis and meta-regression analyses. Results: A total of 16 observational studies involving 109,881 patients with COVID-19 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that patients with a BMI≥30kg/m2 had a 2.35-fold risk(OR = 2.35, 95%CI = 1.64 - 3.38, P < 0.001) for critical COVID-19 and a 2.68-fold risk for COVID-19 mortality (OR = 2.68, 95%CI = 1.65 -4.37, P < 0.001 ) compared with patients with a BMI <30kg/m2. Subgroup analysis results showed that patients with obesity and age > 60 years was associated with a significantly increased risk of critical COVID-19(OR = 3.11, 95%CI = 1.73 - 5.61, P < 0.001) and COVID-19 mortality(OR = 3.93, 95%CI = 2.18 - 7.09, P < 0.001). Meta-regression analysis results also showed that age had a significant influence on the association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality(Coef.=0.036, p=0.048). Random-effects dose-response meta-analysis showed a linear association between BMI and both critical COVID-19(Pnon-linearity = 0.242) and mortality (Pnon-linearity = 0.116). The risk of critical COVID-19 and mortality increased by 9%(OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 1.04 -1.14, P < 0.001) and 6%(OR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.02 -1.10, P = 0.002) for each 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI, respectively. Conclusions: Evidence from this meta-analysis suggested that a linear dose-response association between BMI and both COVID-19 severity and mortality. Further, obesity(BMI≥30kg/m2) was associated with a significantly increased risk of critical COVID-19 and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19.",covid
"Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019, a substantial body of COVID-19 medical literature has been generated. As of June 2020, gaps and longitudinal trends in the COVID-19 medical literature remain unidentified, despite potential benefits for research prioritisation and policy setting in both the COVID-19 pandemic and future large-scale public health crises. Methods: In this paper, we searched PubMed and Embase for medical literature on COVID-19 between 1 January and 24 March 2020. We characterised the growth of the early COVID-19 medical literature using evidence maps and bibliometric analyses to elicit cross-sectional and longitudinal trends and systematically identify gaps. Results: The early COVID-19 medical literature originated primarily from Asia and focused mainly on clinical features and diagnosis of the disease. Many areas of potential research remain underexplored, such as mental health, the use of novel technologies and artificial intelligence, pathophysiology of COVID-19 within different body systems, and indirect effects of COVID-19 on the care of non-COVID-19 patients. Few articles involved research collaboration at the international level (24.7%). The median submission-to-publication duration was 8 days (interquartile range: 4-16). Conclusions: Although in its early phase, COVID-19 research has generated a large volume of publications. However, there are still knowledge gaps yet to be filled and areas for improvement for the global research community. Our analysis of early COVID-19 research may be valuable in informing research prioritisation and policy planning both in the current COVID-19 pandemic and similar global health crises.",covid
"Purpose: Based on the recent literature, chest computed tomography (CT) examination could aid for management of patients during COVID-19 pandemic. However, the role of chest CT in management of COVID-19 patients is not exactly the same for medical or surgical specialties. In orthopaedic or trauma emergency, abdomen, pelvis, cervical, dorsal, and lumbar spine CT are performed to investigate patients; the result is a thoracic CT scan incorporating usually the thorax; however, information about lung parenchyma can be obtained on this thorax CT, and manifestations of COVID-19 can be diagnosed. The objective of our study was to evaluate this role in orthopedic patients to familiarize orthopaedists with the value and limits of thoracic CT in orthopaedic surgery. Materials and methods: Among the 1397 chest CT scans performed during the pandemic period from 1 March 2020 to 10 May 2020, in two centres with orthopaedic surgery, we selected all the 118 thoracic or chest CT performed for patients who presented to the Emergency Department of the hospital with a diagnosis of trauma for orthopaedic surgical treatment. Thirty-nine of these 118 patients were tested with PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Depending on clinical status (symptomatic or non-symptomatic), the information useful for the orthopaedist surgeon and obtained from the Chest CT scan according to the result of the PCR (gold standard) was graded from 0 (no or low value) to 3 (high value). The potential risks of chest CT as exposure to radiation, and specific pathway were analyzed and discussed. A group of patients treated during a previous similar period (1 March 2018 to 15 April 2018) was used as control for evaluation of the increase of CT scanning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Among the 118 patients with chest CT, there were 16 patients with positive COVID-19 chest CT findings, and 102 patients with negative chest CT scan. With PCR results as reference, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value of chest CT in indicating COVID-19 infection were 81%, 93%, and 86%, respectively (p = 0.001). A useful information for the orthopaedic surgeon (graded as 1 for 71 cases, as 2 for 5 cases, and as 3 for 11 cases) was obtained from 118 chest CT scans for 87 (74%) patients, while the CT was no value in 30 (25%) cases, and negative value in one (1%) case. Roughly 20% of the total number of CT scanner performed over the pandemic period was dedicated to COVID-19, but only 2% were for orthopaedic or trauma patients. However, this was ten times higher than during the previous control period of comparison. Conclusion: Although extremely valuable for surgery management, these results should not be overstated. The CT findings studied are not specific for COVID-19, and the positive predictive value of CT will be low unless disease prevalence is high, which was the case during this period.",covid
"Following the unprecedented global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, multiple medical countermeasures ramped up to combat the virus and contain the spread of the pandemic.

In this article, we focus on the use of convalescent plasma as therapeutic approach against COVID-19 infection.",covid
"The NHS in England has rapidly expanded staff testing for COVID-19 in order to allow healthcare workers who would otherwise be isolating with symptoms suspicious of COVID-19 to be cleared to work. However, the high false negative rate associated with current RT-PCR tests could put other staff, family members and patients at risk. We believe combining swab testing with real-time lung ultrasound (LUS) would improve the ability to rule-in COVID-19 infection in those requiring screening.",covid
"I read with interest the recent published article from Professor Robert L. Medcalf, entitled ""Fibrinolysis and COVID-19: a plasmin paradox"" [1]. As an indirect marker of thrombin and plasmin activation, D-dimer has been suggested to guide anticoagulant treat in COVID-19 patients [2, 3]. However, D-dimer may not be able to reflect accurate fibrinolysis status of COVID-19 patients, and therefore can't guide the possible antifibrinolysis or thrombolytic therapy in different stages of COVID-19, as Professor Robert L. Medcalf discussed. Hence, we speculated that measuring direct markers of thrombin, plasmin and so on, may provide more therapeutic targets in COVID-19 patients with coagulopathy.",covid

"SARS-CoV-2 virus causing COVID-19 disease has brought tremendous strain on health care sectors around the world. Being a respiratory disease, COVID-19 has tremendous implications on the otolaryngology residency. Otolaryngology residents are dealing with great apprehension of getting infected while working with both COVID-19 and non-COVID patients. Further, drastic change in the routine has affected their residency training. Outpatient and Inpatient care, elective and emergency surgeries which are a crucial part of the residency training have taken a back seat. India being a densely populated country is still in the midst of the pandemic with cases increasing exponentially each day.

"COVID-19 is known for its magical infectivity, fast transmission and high death toll based on the large number of infected people. From the perspective of the clinical manifestation, autopsy examination and pathophysiology, the essence of COVID-19 should be viewed as a sepsis induced by viral infection, and has the essential characteristics as sepsis induced by other pathogens. Therefore, in addition to etiological and supportive treatment, immunomodulatory therapy is also appropriate to severe COVID-19. Although there is still a lack of consensus on immunotherapy for sepsis so far, relatively rich experiences have been accumulated in the past decades, which will help us in the treatment of severe COVID-19. This article will elaborate immunotherapy of sepsis, though it may not be consistent.",covid
"The number of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been exponentially increasing everyday. It is important to recognize the comorbidities and risk factors associated with this highly contagious and serious disease that has caused thousands of deaths worldwide. Patients with certain conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and chronic lung diseases have been reported to develop serious complications from COVID-19. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease that is more prevalent in the elderly population, the same group that are more susceptible to serious complications from COVID-19. Our literature search did not reveal any review about COVID-19 in IPF patients. We report a patient with IPF who was exposed to COVID-19 from her spouse and died from its complications. This case would help to raise the awareness among IPF patients to follow the necessary precautions to reduce the risk of contracting the disease.",covid
"Previous studies have down that erroneous Conspiracy Theory (CT) beliefs develop more strongly in people who have underlying conspiratorial reasoning styles and psychopathological traits and particularly when they are faced with stressful external events (Swami et al., 2013; van Prooijen, 2018). In this study, we test this proposition by examining the individual differences associated with the development of COVID-19-related CT beliefs during the pandemic. A total of 660 adults completed a survey that captured COVID-related CT beliefs and broader conspiracy beliefs, education, perceived stress and attitudes towards government responses. The results showed that COVID-19 related CT beliefs were: strongly related to broader CT beliefs, higher in those with lower levels of education; and, positively (although weakly) correlated with more negative attitudes towards government responses. However, no relationship was found between COVID-19 beliefs and self-reported stress. These findings hold implications for why some people are more likely to be resistant to public health interventions relating to COVID-19. The findings encourage more detailed exploration of the causes and sources of CTs and, in particular, the role of social media use and other information sources in the development and perpetuation of health-related CT beliefs.",covid
"This article presents the status of countries affected by COVID-19 (as of mid-May 2020) and their preparedness to combat the after-effects of the pandemic. The report also provides an analysis of how human behavior may have triggered such a global pandemic and why humans need to consider living sustainably to make our future world livable for all. COVID-19 originated in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. As of mid-May, it has spread to 213 countries and territories worldwide. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, with a death toll of over 300,000 to date. The U.S. is currently the most impacted country. Collaborative efforts of scientists and politicians across the world will be needed to better plan and utilize global health resources to combat this global pandemic. Machine learning-based prediction models could also help by identifying potential COVID-19-prone areas and individuals. The cause of the emergence of COVID-19 is still a matter of research; however, one consistent theme is humanity's unsustainable behavior. By sustainably interacting with nature, humans may have avoided this pandemic. If unsustainable human practices are not controlled through education, awareness, behavioral change, as well as sustainable policy creation and enforcement, there could be several such pandemics in our future.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic represents a crisis that affects several aspects of people's lives around the globe. Most of the affected countries took several measures, like lockdowns, business shutdowns, hygiene regulations, social distancing, school and university closings, or mobility tracking as a means of slowing down the distribution of COVID-19. These measures are expected to show short-term and long-term effects on people's working lives. However, most media reports focused on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in work arrangements (e.g., short-time work, flexible location and hours) for workers in a regular employment relationship. We here focus on workers in flexible employment relationships (e.g. temporary agency work and other forms of subcontracted labor, as well as new forms of working, such as in the gig economy). Specifically, we will discuss (a) how the work and careers of individuals in flexible employment relationships might get affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) outline ideas how to examine period effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the work and careers of those individuals, and (c) outline how the pandemic can contribute to the ramification of flexible employment relationships.",covid
"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused substantial disruptions in routine clinical care. Emerging data show that surgery in coronavirus disease (COVID)-positive cases can be associated with worsening of clinical outcomes and increased postoperative mortality. Hence, preoperative COVID-19 testing for all patients before elective surgery was implemented in our institution. Materials and methods: Two hundred and sixty-two asymptomatic cancer patients were preoperatively tested for COVID-19 using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction technique with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabbing. All negative patients were operated within 72 hours, and positive patients were quarantined for a minimum 14 days before re-swabbing. Results: In our cohort, 21 of 262 (8.0%) asymptomatic preoperative patients, who were otherwise fit for surgery, tested positive. After adequate quarantine and a negative follow-up test report, 12 of 21 (57%) had an operation. No major postoperative morbidity due to COVID-19 was noted during the immediate postoperative period before discharge from the hospital. Conclusion: Routine preoperative COVID-19 testing was successful in identifying asymptomatic viral carriers. There was no incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in the postoperative period, and there was no incidence of morbidity attributable to COVID-19. These data suggested a beneficial role for mandatory preoperative COVID-19 testing.",covid
"While COVID-19 has primarily been characterized by the respiratory impact of viral pneumonia, it affects every organ system and carries a high consequent risk of death in critically ill patients. Higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores have been associated with increased mortality in patients critically ill patients with COVID-19. It is important that clinicians managing critically ill COVID-19 patients be aware of the multisystem impact of the disease so that care can be focused on the prevention of end-organ injuries to potentially improve clinical outcomes. We review the multisystem complications of COVID-19 and associated treatment strategies to improve the care of critically ill COVID-19 patients.",covid
"Introduction and objectives: Cardiac troponin, a marker of myocardial injury, is frequently observed in patients with COVID-19 infection. Our objective was to analyze myocardial injury and its prognostic implications in patients with and without COVID-19 infection treated in the same period of time. Methods: The present study included patients treated in a university hospital with cardiac troponin I measurements and with suspected COVID-19 infection, confirmed or ruled out by polymerase chain reaction analysis. The impact was analyzed of cardiac troponin I positivity on 30-day mortality. Results: In total, 433 patients were distributed among the following groups: confirmed COVID-19 (n = 186), 22% with myocardial injury (n = 41); and ruled out COVID-19 (n = 247), 21.5% without myocardial injury (n = 52). The confirmed and ruled out COVID-19 groups had a similar age, sex, and cardiovascular history. Mortality was significantly higher in the confirmed COVID-19 group than in the ruled out group (19.9% vs 5.3%, P < .001). In Cox multivariate regression analysis, cardiac troponin I was a predictor of mortality in both groups (confirmed COVID-19 group: HR, 3.54; 95%CI, 1.70-7.34; P = .001; ruled out COVID-19 group: HR, 5.57; 95%CI, 1.70-18.20; P = .004). The predictive model analyzed by ROC curves was similar in the 2 groups (P = .701), with AUCs of 0.808 in the confirmed COVID-19 group (0.750-0.865) and 0.812 in the ruled out COVID-19 group (0.760-0.864). Conclusions: Myocardial injury is detected in 1 in every 5 patients with confirmed or ruled out COVID-19 and predicts 30-day mortality to a similar extent in both circumstances.",covid

"The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in an unprecedented public health crisis worldwide. Recent studies indicate that a hyperinflammatory syndrome induced by SARS-CoV-2 contributes to disease severity and mortality in COVID-19. In this Review, an overview of the pathophysiology underlying the hyperinflammatory syndrome in severe COVID-19 is provided. The current evidence suggests the hyperinflammatory syndrome results from a dysregulated host innate immune response. The gross and microscopic pathological findings as well as the alterations in the cytokine milieu, macrophages/monocytes, natural killer cells, T cells, and neutrophils in severe COVID-19 are summarized. Data also highlighted include the potential therapeutic approaches undergoing investigation to modulate the immune response and abrogate lung injury in severe COVID-19.",covid
"Thromboembolic events with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, such as pulmonary embolism, have been described in recent literature as a manifestation in patients during their hospital admission. Our case report describes a delayed manifestation of bilateral pulmonary embolism in a patient who was discharged home. The patient is a 40-year-old COVID-19 positive male that presented to the emergency department eight days after his discharge with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. On triage, the patient was hypoxic and tachycardic, prompting a high index of suspicion for pulmonary embolism. Computed tomographic angiography of the chest was performed confirming the presence of a bilateral pulmonary embolism. Subsequently, the patient was started on heparin and transferred to a tertiary facility for thrombectomy. Pulmonary embolism is a manifestation of acute COVID-19 infection. It is important for clinicians to have an increased suspicion for pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with worsening dyspnea and hypoxia who were recently admitted for acute COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients that were hospitalized for acute presentation of COVID-19 infection should reasonably be considered for extended anticoagulant therapy after discharge.",covid
"Although Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents primarily as a respiratory condition, a growing body of evidence shows it is a systemic disease.

In a situation such as the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, where healthcare resources are placed under enormous stress, readily available tests such as this play an important role in helping clinicians identify patients at greater risk of developing severe forms of the disease, and should be included in the initial triage panel.",covid
"In this article, several scholars of nationalism discuss the potential for the COVID-19 pandemic to impact the development of nationalism and world politics. To structure the discussion, the contributors respond to three questions: (1) how should we understand the relationship between nationalism and COVID-19; (2) will COVID-19 fuel ethnic and nationalist conflict; and (3) will COVID-19 reinforce or erode the nation-state in the long run? The contributors formulated their responses to these questions near to the outset of the pandemic, amid intense uncertainty. This made it acutely difficult, if not impossible, to make predictions. Nevertheless, it was felt that a historically and theoretically informed discussion would shed light on the types of political processes that could be triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, the aim is to help orient researchers and policy-makers as they grapple with what has rapidly become the most urgent issue of our times.",covid
"We describe the details of a COVID-19 outbreak in a 25-bedded Birmingham neurology/stroke ward in the early phase of the pandemic (March to May 2020). Twenty-one of 133 admissions (16%) tested positive for COVID-19 and of those, 8 (6% of all admissions to the ward) were determined to be nosocomial. Thus 38% (8/21) of COVID-19 infections were hospital-acquired. Ten of the patients that contracted COVID-19 died; of these three were hospital-acquired cases. Five of the 21 patients had negative swabs prior to receiving a positive test result. This study highlights the importance of appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) with high-risk patients (including those with stroke and complex brain injury with tracheostomies) and the difficulties of COVID-19 management in a high-risk patient population.",covid
"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has become an evolving worldwide health crisis. With the rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes has come an increasing awareness of their impacts on infectious diseases, including increased risk for various infections, post-infection complications and mortality from critical infections. Although epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Covid-19 have been constantly reported, no article has systematically illustrated the role of obesity and diabetes in Covid-19, or how Covid-19 affects obesity and diabetes, or special treatment in these at-risk populations. Here, we present a synthesis of the recent advances in our understanding of the relationships between obesity, diabetes and Covid-19 along with the underlying mechanisms, and provide special treatment guidance for these at-risk populations.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Transplant patients are particularly at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 because of their immunosuppressed state, and they have the propensity to develop opportunistic infections. The pre-immunosuppressed state, along with other existing comorbidities, can influence the outcomes of COVID-19 in transplant patients. We describe a case of a renal transplant patient who developed COVID-19. Real-time nucleic acid testing (NAT) should be done in deceased and living donors. The most common management strategy is the modification of immunosuppression along with current experimental strategies for COVID-19.",covid
"In response to provocative comments by 2 European clinicians and scientists, the World Health Organization Director General has declared that Africa will not host COVID-19 vaccine trials. Such a stance risks stigmatizing COVID-19 vaccine trials in Africa and depriving Africa of critical research. To the contrary, there is a critical need for Africa to host COVID-19 vaccine trials on public health, scientific, and ethics grounds.",covid
"Background: Many patients with COVID-19 have pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) co-morbidities or develop acute heart damage during the course of the disease. Objectives: To study the risk of COVID-19 infection in the presence of preexisting CV diseases and to describe new CV manifestations during COVID-19. Methods: A ""scoping review"" was carried out via PubMed, to synthesize the results of research currently published on this subject. Results: Patients with cardiovascular disease were at greater risk of developing COVID-19, especially in its severe form. These patients were five to ten times more at risk of death. Cardiac manifestations, de novo, were dominated by acute myocardial damage, defined by a significant elevation of cardiac troponins. These occurred in 7 to 17% of hospitalized patients. The presence of a new heart lesion in patients with COVID-19 was consistently associated with a poor prognosis. Conclusion: Given the enormous cardiovascular challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the prognostic impact of heart damage, additional research at a high level of evidence will be necessary.",covid
There has been the need to make major modifications to the way cardiology is practised in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. There has also been the need to recognise the complex cardiovascular manifestations and complications of COVID-19. In this article we provide guidance on the management of cardiac patients without COVID-19 in the current pandemic as well as patients with cardiac disease and COVID-19 and patients with cardiac complications of COVID-19. There is also a focus on indications and interpretation of commonly performed cardiac investigations in the setting of COVID-19.

"COVID-19 as an emerging disease has spread to 183 countries and territories worldwide as of 20 March 2020. The first COVID-19 case (i.e. the index case) in Iran was observed in the city of Qom on 19 February 2020. One of the cities of Markazi Province is Delijan, which shares a border with Qom. Consequently, COVID-19 has quickly spread in this city because a large population commutes daily between the two cities. This study aimed to report the challenges and considerations of community-based preparedness at the onset of COVID-19 outbreak in a city of Iran in 2020.",covid
"The novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, responsible of the COVID-19 is now causing a pandemic. Detecting all possible cases and eliminating differential diagnoses in front of any acute respiratory distress has become a daily challenge for doctors around the world.

"COVID-19, a new illness secondary to a novel Coronavirus emerged in December 2019 in China. Our early understanding of the clinical features of COVID-19 has been based on case series emerging from the first outbreak in Wuhan. These features included fever, a dry cough, myalgia and dyspnea. Gastrointestinal symptoms were rarely reported as a key feature. We present a case report of a 74-year-old male who presented with symptoms of gastroenteritis and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. This article aims to highlight an uncommon presentation of COVID-19 and that a high index of suspicion is required for COVID-19 in older people given their greater likelihood of presenting atypically.",covid
"Background: Pneumonia caused by COVID-19 shares overlapping imaging manifestations with other types of pneumonia. How to objectively and quantitatively differentiate pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 virus remains clinical challenge. Objective: To formulate standardized scoring criteria and an objective quantization standard to guide decision making in detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 virus induced pneumonia in clinical practice. Methods: A retrospective dataset includes computed tomography (CT) images acquired from 43 pneumonia patients with COVID-19 virus detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and 49 pneumonia patients without COVID-19 virus. All patients were treated during the same time period in two hospitals. Key indicators of differential diagnosis were identified in relevant literature and the scores were quantified namely, patients with more than 8 points were identified as high risk, those with 6-8 points as moderate risk, and those with fewer than 6 points as low risk for COVID-19 virus. In the study, 3 radiologists determined the scores for all patients. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were subsequently calculated. Results: A total of 61 patients were determined as high risk, among which 42 were COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR tests. Next, 9 were identified as moderate risk, one of whom was COVID-19 positive. Last, 22 were classified into the low-risk group, all of them are COVID-19 negative. Based on these results, the sensitivity of detection COVID-19 positive cases between the high-risk group and the non-high-risk group was 0.98 with 95% confidence interval [0.88, 1.00], and the specificity was 0.61 [0.46, 0.75]. The detection sensitivity between the moderate-/high-risk group and the low-risk group was 1.00 [0.92, 1.00], and the specificity was 0.45 [0.31, 0.60]. Conclusion: The proposed quantitative scoring criteria showed high sensitivity and moderate specificity in detecting COVID-19 using CT images, which indicates that these criteria may be beneficial for screening in real-world practice and helpful for long-term disease control.",covid
"Background: Prevention is the best way to manage a pandemic like COVID-19. The World Health Organization has issued public advice to create awareness by providing people knowledge to prevent/protect them from COVID-19. Hence, the present study was planned to assess knowledge of prevention and its practical use amongst samples from the Saudi Arabian population. It can be used to bring awareness among the masses not only in expanding their knowledge about COVID-19 but also on how to enforce a practicing behavior in relation to the prevention of COVID-19. The study is among the pioneer studies on the issue related to knowledge and practice of the prevention of COVID-19 among Saudis and foreign nationals residing in Saudi Arabia. Objective: The prime objective of this study is to examine the existence of knowledge among the Saudi and non-Saudi nationals about COVID-19 and its impact on their behavior to practice the protocols to prevent the disastrous infection of COVID-19. This study has also examined how the residents in Saudi Arabia react to the methods and protection measures adopted by the government for their dominions to eradicate the spread of COVID-19. Methods: The study used a survey-based methodology and data was collected from Saudi nationals as well as expatriates living and working in five different regions of Saudi Arabia. Non-probability snowball sampling was used to reach and select the population of the current study. A self-designed, structured, and validated questionnaire was electronically distributed among the respondents. SPSS version 21 was used to analyze the data of the current study. Results: Out of the 443 respondents, 356 respondents (84%) knew they had to wash their hands for 20 seconds and did this as well, 303 respondents (75%) knew that sneezing or coughing into the arm/elbow can prevent the spread of COVID-19 and were doing this as well, 357 respondents (82%) knew that COVID-19 can be transferred by shaking hands and avoided this, 333 respondents (79%) knew that they had to maintain a safe distance of at least one meter and kept this distance, 315 respondents (76%) knew that touching one's face can transfer the virus and avoid this, and 414 respondents (95%) knew that staying at home can decrease the chances of getting infected. The relationship between different regions and most of the knowledge-based and practice-based questions was significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Results reveal that there is a significant relationship between knowledge and practice, but the strength of association is weak. It was found that knowledge and practice of COVID-19 was followed differently in the five regions of Saudi Arabia and the level of education of the respondents influenced their choice of practice to protect themselves from the effects of COVID-19. The study has contributed in the body of literature by examining the inter-relationship between knowledge and practice and their use in prevention of COVID-19 among the Saudi population.",covid
"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought critical challenges to anesthesiologists and perioperative practice. Whereas anesthesiologists may be primarily concerned with airway and respiratory management, the COVID-19 data accumulated to date indicate that primary and/or secondary cardiovascular complications are common. Previous studies have demonstrated that the mortality rate is significantly higher in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) than in patients without CVD. Dysregulation of immune function in patients with CVD may be involved in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Anesthesia and surgical procedures can modulate the immune system, and some patients undergoing surgery, particularly those undergoing cardiovascular procedures, have CVD. In perioperative management for patients with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 and those who have recovered from COVID-19, it is important for anesthesiologists to be concerned not only with airway and respiratory management, but also with cardiovascular complications and perioperative circulatory management to control the progression of the disease in patients with COVID-19.",covid
"Immune dysregulation characterized by T cell exhaustion and high level of inflammatory cytokines is associated with severe COVID-19. Figuring out the early event of immune dysregulation would provide a potential treatment for COVID-19. Recent evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction participates in the development of COVID-19 and may be responsible for the dysregulated immune response. Mitochondrial-targeted ubiquinone (MitoQ), a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, shows beneficial effects on various diseases through improving mitochondrial dysfunction. We hypothesize that MitoQ could act as a potential treatment in COVID-19. MitoQ may alleviate cytokine storm and restore the function of exhausted T cells in COVID-19 patients through improving mitochondrial dysfunction. In this article, we provide evidence to support the use of MitoQ as a potential treatment or adjunct therapy in the context of COVID-19.",covid
"Increasing insight into the clinical phenotype and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 has identified damage of the kidneys as a key player in the course of the disease. This manuscript summarizes the current knowledge on direct viral infection of kidney tissue, proteinuria and acute kidney injury in COVID-19, and management of patients on chronic dialysis as well as after kidney transplantation. Direct infection of podocytes and proximal tubular cells by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed and results in proteinuria and hematuria at an early stage of COVID-19. In this context, any kidney affection is a predictor of worse outcomes among COVID-19 patients irrespective of the initial presentation and increases the risk of acute kidney injury. Specific therapies for kidney damage and acute kidney injury within COVID-19 that could be generally recommended are currently lacking. Patients on chronic hemodialysis in particular are at risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infections as indicated by outbreaks and super-spreading events in hemodialysis facilities. Immunosuppressive therapy after kidney transplantation needs to be adapted upon diagnosis of COVID-19 depending on the severity of the initial presentation.",covid
"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the worldwide pandemic of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) On March 11, 2020, just three months after the first outbreak of COVID-19 caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in China in December 2019. COVID-19 is a contagious disease that can affect anyone, anytime, anywhere, and has had a huge impact on our lives, including social, economic, educational, and cultural life.

"The use of masks as a means of reducing transmission of COVID-19 outside healthcare settings has proved controversial. Masks are thought to have two modes of effect: they prevent infection with COVID-19 in wearers; and prevent transmission by individuals with subclinical infection. We used a simple next-generation matrix approach to estimate the conditions under which masks would reduce the reproduction number of COVID-19 under a threshold of 1. Our model takes into account the possibility of assortative mixing, where mask users interact preferentially with other mask users. We make 3 key observations: 1. Masks, even with suboptimal efficacy in both prevention of acquisition and transmission of infection, could substantially decrease the reproduction number for COVID-19 if widely used. 2. Widespread masking may be sufficient to suppress epidemics where R has been brought close to 1 via other measures (e.g., distancing). 3. ""Assortment"" within populations (the tendency for interactions between masked individuals to be more likely than interactions between masked and unmasked individuals) would rapidly erode the impact of masks. As such, mask uptake needs to be fairly universal to have an effect. This simple model suggests that widespread uptake of masking could be determinative in suppressing COVID-19 epidemics in regions with R(t) at or near 1.",covid
"This study aims to analyze the correlation between weather and covid-19 pandemic in the capital city of Norway, Oslo. This study employed a secondary data analysis of covid-19 surveillance data from the Norwegian public health institute and weather data from the Norwegian Meteorological institute. The components of weather include minimum temperature (°C), maximum temperature (°C), temperature average (°C), normal temperature (°C), precipitation level (mm) and wind speed (m/s). Since normality was not fulfilled, a non-parametric correlation test was used for data analysis. Maximum temperature (r = 0.347; p = .005), normal temperature(r = 0.293; p = .019), and precipitation level (r = -0.285; p = .022) were significantly correlated with covid-19 pandemic.

"In the near future, the overlap of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and dengue epidemics is a concrete threat in tropical regions. Co-epidemics of COVID-19 and dengue could be an overwhelming challenge for health systems in low- and middle-income countries. In this work, we investigated potential serological cross-reactions between COVID-19 and dengue patients. Among 32 COVID-19 positive sera, no positive Dengue virus (DENV) IgG/IgM results were observed. On the other hand, one false-positive result was observed among 44 DENV-positive sera tested for COVID-19 antibodies with each of the two rapid tests used.

"The COVID-19 pandemic revealed and exacerbated existing social and economic health disparities and actionable epidemiological evidence is needed to identify potential vulnerability factors to help inform targeted responses. In this commentary, methodological challenges and opportunities regarding the links between air pollution and COVID-19 are discussed with a focus on: i) the role of differential exposure to air pollution across populations and explain spatio-temporal variability of the epidemic spread and resultant mortality; ii) the indirect impacts of interventions treated as natural experiments to control COVID-19 person-to-person spread on air pollution and population health. I first discuss the potential mechanisms between exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 and the opportunity to clearly formulate causal questions of interest through the target trial framework. Then, I discuss challenges regarding the use of quasi-experimental designs that capitalize on the differential timing of COVID-19 policies including the selection of control groups and potential violations of the common shock assumption. Finally, I discuss environmental justice implications of this many-headed beast of a crisis.",covid

"During the ongoing pandemic, anosmia, whether or not associated with aguesia, has been a common symptom in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection causing COVID-19. We here report two cases of anosemia without aguesia in adults with COVID-19. The onset was brutal and symptomsa persisted for a few weeks after healing. The patients presented to the ENT Department where they received no therapy and underwent outpatient surveillance. After 5 weeks, patients reported they had recovered the sense of smell. This study highlights that anosmia can occur without aguesia and persist after healing in COVID-19 patients. Recovery of the smell is possible after a few weeks without medical treatment. That is why, patients follow-up is essential in subjects recovered from COVID-19 to better understand the course of persistent symptoms.",covid

"Background: Increasing evidence suggests pernio-like lesions are cutaneous manifestations of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: To describe clinical and pathologic findings of pernio-like lesions in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Methods: An international dermatology registry was circulated to health care providers worldwide through the American Academy of Dermatology, International League of Dermatologic Societies, and other organizations. Results: We documented 505 patients with dermatologic manifestations associated with COVID-19, including 318 (63%) with pernio-like lesions. Patients with pernio-like lesions were generally young and healthy, with relatively mild COVID-19. Of 318 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 by providers, 23 (7%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive, and 20 others (6%) were close contacts of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Given current testing criteria, many patients lacked COVID-19 testing access. For 55% of patients, pernio-like lesions were their only symptom. In patients with other COVID-19 symptoms, pernio-like lesions typically appeared after other symptoms. Pernio-like lesions lasted a median of 14 days (interquartile range, 10-21 days). Limitations: A case series cannot estimate population-level incidence or prevalence. In addition, there may be confirmation bias in reporting. We cannot exclude an epiphenomenon. Conclusions: Pernio-like skin changes of the feet and hands, without another explanation, may suggest COVID-19 infection and should prompt confirmatory testing.",covid
"Background: According to the required reorganization of all hospital activities, the recent COVID-19 pandemic had dramatic consequences on the orthopedic world. We think that informing the orthopedic community about the strategy that we adopted both in our hospital and in our Department of Orthopedics could be useful, particularly for those who are facing the pandemic later than Italy. Methods: Changes were done in our hospital by medical direction to reallocate resources to COVID-19 patients. In the Orthopedic Department, a decrease in the number of beds and surgical activity was stabilized. Since March 13, it has been avoided to perform elective surgery, and since March 16, non-urgent outpatient consultations were abolished. This activity reduction was associated with careful evaluation of staff and patients: extensive periodical swab testing of all healthcare staff and swab testing of all surgical patients were applied. Results: These restrictions determined an overall reduction of all our surgical activities of 30% compared to 2019. We also had a reduction in outpatient clinic activities and admissions to the orthopedic emergency unit. Extensive swab testing has proven successful: of more than 160 people tested in our building, only three COVID-19 positives were found, and of over more than 200 surgical procedures, only two positive patients were found. Conclusions: Extensive swab test of all people (even if asymptomatic) and proactive tracing and quarantining of potential COVID-19 positive patients may diminish the virus spread.",covid
"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted the practice of endoscopy, but characteristics of COVID patients undergoing endoscopy have not been adequately described. Aims: To compare findings, clinical outcomes, and patient characteristics of endoscopies performed during the pandemic in patients with and without COVID-19. Methods: This was a retrospective multicenter study of adult endoscopies at six academic hospitals in New York between March 16 and April 30, 2020. Patient and procedure characteristics including age, sex, indication, findings, interventions, and outcomes were compared in patients testing positive, negative, or untested for COVID-19. Results: Six hundred and five endoscopies were performed on 545 patients during the study period. There were 84 (13.9%), 255 (42.2%), and 266 (44.0%) procedures on COVID-positive, negative, and untested patients, respectively. COVID patients were more likely to undergo endoscopy for gastrointestinal bleeding or gastrostomy tube placement, and COVID patients with gastrointestinal bleeding more often required hemostatic interventions on multivariable logistic regression. COVID patients had increased length of stay, intensive care unit admission, and intubation rate. Twenty-seven of 521 patients (5.2%) with no or negative COVID testing prior to endoscopy later tested positive, a median of 13.5 days post-procedure. Conclusions: Endoscopies in COVID patients were more likely to require interventions, due either to more severe illness or a higher threshold to perform endoscopy. A significant number of patients endoscoped without testing were subsequently found to be COVID-positive. Gastroenterologists in areas affected by the pandemic must adapt to changing patterns of endoscopy practice and ensure pre-endoscopy COVID testing.",covid

"Objective: To explore ABO blood group distribution and clinical characteristics in patients with COVID-19. Methods: The clinical data of 187 patients with COVID-19 seen between January 20, 2020 and March 5, 2020 at the First Hospital of Changsha were retrospectively analyzed. The differences in the ABO blood group distribution between COVID-19 patients and the control group (1991 cases) were analyzed. The relationship between blood type and clinical characteristics was analyzed. Results: Of the 187 patients with COVID-19, 69 had type A (36.90%), 63 had type B (33.69%), 41 had type O (21.92%), and 14 had type AB blood (7.49%). The proportion of patients with type A blood in the COVID-19 group was significantly higher than that in the control group (36.90% vs. 27.47%, P = 0.006), while the proportion of patients with type O blood in the COVID-19 group was significantly lower than that in the control group (21.92% vs. 30.19%, P = 0.018). The risk of COVID-19 was higher for individuals with blood group A than for those with blood group O (OR = 1.849, 95% CI = 1.228-2.768, P = 0.003). The risk of COVID-19 was higher for patients with blood group A than for those with a blood group other than A (OR = 1.544, 95% CI = 1.122-2.104, P = 0.006). Patients with blood group O had a lower risk of COVID-19 than non-O blood group patients (OR = 0.649, 95% CI = 0.457-0.927, P = 0.018). The ABO blood group distribution was related to COVID-19 status. Conclusions: Patients with blood group A had an increased risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, whereas blood group O was associated with a decreased risk, indicating that certain ABO blood groups were correlated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Blood type was related to some clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19.",covid

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has become a global pandemic. The deleterious effects of coronavirus have prompted the development of diagnostic tools to manage the spread of disease. While conventional technologies such as quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) have been broadly used to detect COVID-19, they are time-consuming, labor-intensive and are unavailable in remote settings. Point-of-care (POC) biosensors, including chip-based and paper-based biosensors are typically low-cost and user-friendly, which offer tremendous potential for rapid medical diagnosis. This mini review article discusses the recent advances in POC biosensors for COVID-19. First, the development of POC biosensors which are made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), papers, and other flexible materials such as textile, film, and carbon nanosheets are reviewed. The advantages of each biosensors along with the commercially available COVID-19 biosensors are highlighted. Lastly, the existing challenges and future perspectives of developing robust POC biosensors to rapidly identify and manage the spread of COVID-19 are briefly discussed.",covid
"This study presents an in-depth investigation on the transmission of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from the urban perspective. It focuses on the ""aftermath"" of the outbreak and the spread of the infection among cities. Especially, this study provides insights of the fundamentals of the factors that may affect the spread of the infection in cities, where the marginal effects of some most influential factors to the virus transmission are estimated. It reveals that the distance to epicenter is a very strong influential factor, and is negatively linked with the spread of COVID-19. In addition, subway, wastewater and residential garbage are positively connected with the virus transmission. Moreover, both urban area and population density are negatively associated with the spread of COVID-19 at the early stage of the epidemic. Furthermore, this study also provides high precision estimation of the number of COVID-19 infection in Wuhan city, which is the epicenter of the outbreak in China. Based on the real-world data of cities outside Wuhan on March 2, 2020, the estimated number is 56,944.866 (mean value), which is very close to the officially reported number. The methodology and main conclusions shown in this paper are of general interest, and they can be applied to other countries to help understand the local transmission of COVID-19 as well.",covid

This analysis outlines basic features and principles involved in economic studies, specifically economic impact studies and economic evaluations, which have formed a significant part of the ever-increasing evidence base about COVID-19. This analysis introduces economic studies in this context, highlighting what they can do, their limitations, and key steps involved in conducting them. It highlights examples of economic analysis focused on COVID-19 and on health emergencies and disasters more broadly. Knowing how economic studies are conducted, and their limitations, will help introduce how their findings can be a useful, usable, and used part of efforts to tackle this global health crisis.",covid
"According to WHO recommendations, everyone must protect themselves against Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which will also protect others. Due to the lack of current effective treatment and vaccine for COVID-19, screening, rapid diagnosis and isolation of the patients are essential (1, 2). Therefore, identifying the early symptoms of COVID-19 is of particular importance and is a health system priority. Early studies from COVID-19 outbreak in China have illustrated several non-specific signs and symptoms in infected patients, including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, lymphopenia, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia (3, 4). Recently, a probability of association between COVID-19 and altered olfactory function has been reported in South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, UK and the United States (5-8). However, to our knowledge, the definite association between COVID-19 and anosmia has not been published.",covid
Drugs that are specifically efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be established. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have garnered considerable attention for their potential to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Increasing evidence obtained from completed clinical studies indicates the prospects for chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. More randomized control clinical studies are warranted to determine the feasibility of these two drugs in treating COVID-19.,covid

"Typical manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) involve the upper and lower respiratory tract. But as the pandemic surges, we are encountering numerous case reports and series of extrapulmonary presentations of COVID-19 in the outpatient department. Abundant retrospective data have also cited various extrapulmonary complications in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This knowledge needs to be condensed and disseminated in order to improve COVID-19 surveillance and to reduce the accidental exposure of healthcare workers. Our review suggests that gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, nervous system, renal system, and manifestations due to hematological abnormalities are common masqueraders to watch out for.

"Aim: To provide recommendations for the management of patients with cancer in the COVID-19 era. Background: The current global pandemic of COVID-19 has severely impacted global healthcare systems. Several groups of people are considered high-risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including patients with cancer. Therefore, protocols for the better management of these patients during this viral pandemic are necessary. So far, several protocols have been presented regarding the management of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, none of them points to a developing country with limited logistics and facilities. Methods: In this review, we have provided a summary of recommendations on the management of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic based on our experience in Shohada-e Tajrish Hospital, Iran. Results: We recommend that patients with cancer should be managed in an individualized manner during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Our recommendation provides a guide for oncology centers of developing countries for better management of cancer.",covid
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has within months turned the world upside down. With personal distancing and shortage of personal protective equipment, face-to-face health care encounters are increasingly becoming problematic. Neurological manifestations are also being observed in clinical presentations. Objective: Worldwide most countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centre for Disease Control (USA) have recommended use of Telemedicine during the current pandemic.With acute shortage of neurologists and neurosurgeons and their lopsided distribution, it becomes more difficult to provide neurological care to those who need it the most, particularly with travel restrictions. The author has since 2002 been advocating use of Telemedicine in Neurosciences. Materials and methods: This article reviews the increasing deployment of Telemedicine in neurological practice in the last few years, particularly the radical exponential use in the last few months due to COVID-19. Conclusions: With possible reduction in face-to-face consultations, remote evaluation may become mainstream. Webinars will play an increasing role. CME's and resident training will become more and more digital. The world will never be the same again. It is imperative that we accept and start deploying the ""New Normal"".",covid
"During the COVID-19 outbreak, some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia also suffered from acute abdomen requiring surgical treatment; however, there is no consensus for the treatment of such patients. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed 34 patients with acute abdomen who underwent emergency surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak. Among the 34 patients with acute abdomen, a total of six cases were found with COVID-19 pneumonia (clinical classification for COVID-19 pneumonia: all were the common type). On the premise of similar demographics between both groups, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had worse indicators of liver and coagulation function. Compared with acute abdomen patients without COVID-19, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had a longer hospital stay, but there were no significant differences in postsurgical complications (P = 0.58) or clinical outcomes (P = 0.56). In addition, an obvious resolution of lung inflammation after surgery was observed in five COVID-19 patients (83.3%). No new COVID-19 cases occurred during the patients' hospital stays. Therefore, for the common type of COVID-19 pneumonia, emergency surgery could not only improve the outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with acute abdomen, but also benefit the resolution of pulmonary inflammation.",covid
"Purpose: Given incomplete data reporting by race, we used data on COVID-19 cases and deaths in U.S. counties to describe racial disparities in COVID-19 disease and death and associated determinants. Methods: Using publicly available data (accessed April 13, 2020), predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths were compared between disproportionately (≥13%) black and all other (<13% black) counties. Rate ratios were calculated, and population attributable fractions were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. National maps with county-level data and an interactive scatterplot of COVID-19 cases were generated. Results: Nearly 90% of disproportionately black counties (656/677) reported a case and 49% (330/677) reported a death versus 81% (1987/2465) and 28% (684/2465), respectively, for all other counties. Counties with higher proportions of black people have higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater air pollution. Counties with higher proportions of black residents had more COVID-19 diagnoses (Rate Ratio (RR): 1.24, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-1.33) and deaths (RR: 1.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.40), after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration. COVID-19 deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties. The population attributable fraction of COVID-19 diagnosis due to lack of health insurance was 3.3% for counties with less than 13% black residents and 4.2% for counties with greater than or equal to 13% black residents. Conclusions: Nearly 20% of U.S. counties are disproportionately black, and they accounted for 52% of COVID-19 diagnoses and 58% of COVID-19 deaths nationally. County-level comparisons can both inform COVID-19 responses and identify epidemic hot spots. Social conditions, structural racism, and other factors elevate risk for COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths in black communities.",covid
"This commentary provides an overview of the impact of COVID-19 on the commercial fishing industry. The information highlighted in the article was gathered from fishermen, fishing industry experts, health and safety advisors, and advocates. From these first-hand accounts, we provide the immediate and expansive impacts of COVID-19 on fishermen's health and wellbeing. In particular, we discuss the economic impact of COVID-19 market disruptions, as well as the very real, logistical challenges of protecting workers on fishing vessels. We also provide examples of how these combined issues have led to increased occupational risk in one of the nation's most deadly industries. Lastly, we identify a number of recommendations for providing much-needed support for commercial fishermen in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid

"COVID-2019 disease mainly affects the respiratory tract and can progress in severe cases to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. Patients with prior cardiovascular disease are at higher risk of developing an infection and progressing to a severe form of the disease. Also, due to the growing number of infected cases, it is clear that, in addition to the typical respiratory symptoms caused by the infection, some patients suffer from cardiovascular damage. This condition can, in fact, cause significant myocardial damage, which worsens the disease and affects the prognosis. Based on the results of currently published research, it seems important to discuss the manifestations and characteristics of myocardial damage induced by COVID-19 and its impact on patient prognosis.",covid

"Job loss and evictions tied to the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to significantly increase homelessness in the coming months. Reciprocally, homelessness and the many vulnerabilities that inevitably accompany it are driving COVID-19 outbreaks in U.S. shelters and other congregate living situations. Unless we intervene to address homelessness, these co-existing and synergistic situations will make the current public health crisis even worse. Preventing homelessness and providing permanent affordable housing has reduced the ravages of the HIV epidemic. We must take the lessons learned in 40 years of fighting HIV to respond effectively to the COVID-19 crisis. Housing is an investment that will curb the spread of COVID-19 and help protect all of us from future pandemics.",covid

"Thrombosis, especially venous thromboembolism, is a complication often associated with COVID-19. However, there have been relatively few reports of arterial thrombosis. Here, we describe a case of non-severe COVID-19 in a patient with dilated cardiomyopathy. After admission, symptoms, laboratory data, and imaging findings improved, but D-dimer levels gradually increased. Contrast computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography revealed a left ventricular thrombus. Anti-coagulant treatment diminished the thrombus, and the patient recovered and was discharged. Although a left ventricular thrombus is a rare COVID-19 complication, performing appropriate diagnostic tests could improve COVID-19 mortality in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.",covid
"Background: The 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global health emergency. The extreme actions aimed to reduce virus diffusion have profoundly changed the lifestyles of the Italian population. Moreover, fear of contracting the infection has generated high levels of anxiety. This study aimed to understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on sleep quality, general anxiety symptomatology, and psychological distress. Methods: An online survey collected information on socio-demographic data and additional information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, sleep quality, sleep disorders, generalized anxiety symptoms, psychological distress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology related to COVID-19 were assessed. Results: This study included 2291 respondents. The results revealed that 57.1% of participants reported poor sleep quality, 32.1% high anxiety, 41.8% high distress, and 7.6% reported PTSD symptomatology linked to COVID-19. Youth and women, those uncertain regarding possible COVID-19 infection, and greater fear of direct contact with those infected by COVID-19 had an increased risk of developing sleep disturbances, as well as higher levels of anxiety and distress. Finally, a significant relationship between sleep quality, generalized anxiety, and psychological distress with PTSD symptoms related to COVID-19 was evidenced. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be a risk factor for sleep disorders and psychological diseases in the Italian population, as previously reported in China. These results should be used as a starting point for further studies aimed to develop psychological interventions to minimize the brief and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Objective: To provide a descriptive account of the challenges and administrative preparedness for establishing and sustaining safe obstetric services during the COVID-19 pandemic at Topiwala National Medical College & BYL Nair Charitable Hospital (NH), Mumbai, India. Methods: The management of pregnant women with COVID-19 was implemented as per international (WHO, RCOG, ACOG) and national (Indian Council of Medical Research) recommendations and guidelines at an academic, tertiary care, COVID-19 hospital in India. Results: Using a multidisciplinary approach and active engagement of a multispecialty team, obstetric services were provided to over 400 women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. A sustainable model is established for providing services to pregnant women with COVID-19 in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, India. Conclusion: With limited resources, it is possible to set up dedicated maternity services, aligned to international guidelines, for safe pregnancy outcomes in COVID-19 settings. This COVID-19 hospital addressed the challenges and implemented several known and novel methods to establish and sustain obstetric services for women with COVID-19. The model established in the present study can be replicated in other low- and middle-income countries.",covid
"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a serious infectious disease that causes severe respiratory illness. This pandemic represents a serious public health risk. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is essential to control disease progression. Radiological examination plays a crucial role in the early identification and management of infected patients. Objective: The aim of this review was to identify the diagnostic value of different imaging modalities used for diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. The keywords diagnostic imaging, radiology, respiratory infection, pneumonia, coronavirus infection and COVID-19 were used to identify radiology articles focusing on the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to determine the diagnostic value of various imaging modalities, including x-ray, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and nuclear medicine for identification and management of infected patients. Results: We identified 50 articles in the literature search. Studies that investigated the diagnostic roles and imaging features of patients with COVID-19, using either chest CT, lung ultrasound, chest x-ray, or positron emission topography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan, were discussed. Of these imaging modalities, chest x-ray and CT scan are the most commonly used for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients, with chest CT scan being more accurate and sensitive in identifying COVID-19 at early stages. Only a few studies have investigated the roles of ultrasound and PET/CT scan in diagnosing COVID-19. Conclusions: Chest CT scan remains the most sensitive imaging modality in initial diagnosis and management of suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19. Other diagnostic imaging modalities could add value in evaluating disease progression and monitoring critically ill patients with COVID-19.",covid
"Importance: The newly emerged coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), is threatening the world. Olfactory or gustatory dysfunction is reported as one of the symptoms worldwide. As reported so far, different clinical features have been reported according to outbreak sites and gender; most of the patients, who complained of anosmia or hyposmia, were Europeans. We had a fast review for novel articles about COVID-19 infection and olfactory function. Observations: Rapid reviews for COVID-19 or other viral infection and olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunctions were done in this review. Up to date, a lot of reports have shown that olfactory dysfunction is related to viral infections but no exact mechanism, clinical course, and definite treatment have been discovered, which is also same in COVID-19. In general, intranasal steroid (INS) and oral steroid for short time help improve the recovery of the olfactory function in case of olfactory dysfunction after virus infection. Considering severe respiratory complications and immunocompromised state of COVID-19, the use of steroid should be limited and cautious because we do not have enough data to support the usage of steroid to treat olfactory dysfunction in the clinical course of COVID-19. Conclusions and relevance: In the days of pandemic COVID-19, we should keep in mind that olfactory dysfunctions, even without other upper respiratory infection or otolaryngologic symptoms, might be the early signs of COVID-19.",covid
"Background: Little is known regarding what people who use drugs (PWUD) know about COVID-19 related issues and changes in the drug market due to COVID-19. We therefore conducted a survey to explore these issues. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we interviewed 226 PWUD from three Norwegian cities in May/June 2020. Participants completed an interview-administrated questionnaire. Three separate multiple binary logistic regression models were estimated with the outcomes (no/yes): 1. Familiarity with COVID-19 symptoms, 2. Awareness of COVID-19 services tailored towards PWUD and, 3. Willingness to take a COVID-19 test. Results: The mean age was 44.1 years and 73 % were males. Fifty-four percent were injectors, and heroin/other opioids (35.8 %) and cocaine/amphetamine (25.2 %) were the most common main drugs used. Overall, 54.9 % were in opioid maintenance treatment (OMT). The majority (65.9 %) stated they knew the COVID-19 symptoms. Almost all the participants (91.2 %) reported they would take a COVID-19 test if experiencing relevant symptoms. The majority (63.7 %) were not aware of COVID-19 services available to PWUD. OMT patients were more likely to be familiar with COVID-19 symptoms (aOR = 3.4, 95 % CI 1.7; 6.8), and to be aware of COVID-19 services (aOR = 2.7, 95 % CI 1.1; 6.3). Overall, 35.4 % reported reduced drug availability, mainly for tranquilizers, while 61.5 % reported increased drug prices, mainly for cannabis. Conclusion: Drug treatment may play an important role in COVID-19 prevention, as those in OMT were more likely to be aware of symptoms and of availability of services.",covid
"All aspects of family law have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It has posed challenges for the operation of the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court, the obtaining of expert reports, the conduct of hearings, the functioning of contact centres, and the mode of delivery of children's schooling. In Australia and in Ontario an attempt has been made to be clear about what is expected of parents during the period of crisis. An Australian innovation has been the establishment of a COVID-19 List and communication by the Chief Justice of the Family Court about what is expected of parents by way of compliance with orders from chief health officers and safe practices to protect children against infection, especially those with particular health vulnerabilities. This column reviews such initiatives and a number of the significant family law decisions during the early phase of Australia's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Research shows that Covid-19 enhanced inequality in families' learning environments. We use register data from Denmark to analyze inequality in families' takeout of digital children's books from public libraries. Our register data, which include more than 55 million observations of families' daily library takeout, show that the socioeconomic gradient in library takeout (by parents' education and income) that existed before the Covid-19 lockdown increased after the lockdown. We also find that the increase in the socioeconomic gradient during Covid-19 was weaker in immigrant than in native families, stronger in families with recent experience in taking out digital materials from the library, and stronger in families with children in the early stages of elementary school. Overall, our results suggest that Covid-19 increased inequality in learning opportunities because better off families were more successful at using libraries during the pandemic than worse off families.",covid
"The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that began in Wuhan, China, became an international emergency when thousands of people were infected around the world. COVID-19 emerged in Pakistan in April 2020, precipitating a nationwide lockdown. While some countries are now recovering from the pandemic, its peak is not estimated to occur in Pakistan until August 2020. We present a case of rheumatic heart disease with fever, myalgia and an unusual radiological finding of the virus.

"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from Wuhan, China in December 2019 leads to the present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The various symptoms identified for COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, sore throat, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia, and headache. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are emerging as a new symptom more in the European patients. Taste disturbances are common in various oral and systemic diseases. Varying severity and onset of taste disturbances are reported in COVID-19 positive patients in this pandemic. But a sudden onset of taste disturbances without an established and recognized cause should raise suspicion of COVID-19.

"In December 2019, there was an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. The number of patients in China has risen to 31,000. We collected patient data from four Chinese cities (Hefei, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Shenzhen) and described epidemiologic characteristics. As of 6 February 2020, we extracted data from 950 patients from the four cities. There were 477 (50.21%) males and 473 (49.79%) females of age (mean ± SD) 45.64 ± 15.59 years. Before contracting COVID-19, 299 patients had contact with Wuhan residents or contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (31.47%). Also, 138 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection of unknown source (14.53%). COVID-19 patients in the four cities were mainly from Wuhan originally, and had spread infection locally. Therefore, the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in cities outside Wuhan were mainly input. Cutting off input and controlling community communication would reduce local incidence.",covid
"The emergence of COVID-19 has recently dominated public discourse given its serious impact on vulnerable patient groups. Advice in relation to reducing risk of contamination has justifiably been circulated widely during the COVID-19 crisis. Contamination fear is a common obsessional theme in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and there is a need for increased research on how infectious disease epidemics affect patients with OCD. We present the case of a lady in her 30s with a history of well-controlled contamination OCD who presented acutely with a significant exacerbation of OCD symptoms precipitated by media reports of COVID-19. The case highlights the potential psychological impacts of infectious disease epidemics on individuals with mental illness. We also highlight some of the risks posed to such patients in response to epidemics such as the COVID-19 crisis.",covid
"Introduction: This report summarises the early experience of implementing elective colorectal cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODS: A pathway to minimize the risk of including COVID-19 positive patients for elective surgery was established. Prioritization and additional safety measures were introduced into clinical practice. Minimal-invasive surgery (MIS) was used where appropriate. Results: Thirty-eight patients were prioritised, and 23 patients underwent surgery (8 colon, 14 rectal and 1 anal cancer). MIS rate was 78%. There were no major postoperative complications or patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Histopathological outcomes were similar to normal practice. Conclusion: A safe pathway to offer standard high-quality surgery to colorectal cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is feasible.",covid

"Background/objectives: Nursing homes have experienced a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Early analyses indicated that baseline quality was not predictive of nursing home cases, but a more nuanced study of the role of nurse staffing is needed to target resources and better respond to future outbreaks. We sought to understand whether baseline nurse staffing is associated with the presence of COVID-19 in nursing homes and whether staffing impacts outbreak severity. Design: We analyzed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) facility-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths merged with nursing home and county characteristics. We used logistic regressions to examine the associations of staffing levels from Nursing Home Compare with the outcomes of any COVID-19 cases and, conditional on at least one case, an outbreak. Among facilities with at least one case, we modeled count of deaths using hurdle negative binomial-2 regressions. Setting: All nursing homes in the CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset with reports that passed the CMS Quality Assurance Check as of June 25, 2020. Participants: Residents of nursing homes that met COVID-19 reporting requirements. Measurements: A nursing home is defined as having at least one case is if one or more confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case among residents or staff is reported. Conditional on at least one case, we examine two outcomes: an outbreak, defined as confirmed cases/certified beds >10% or total confirmed and suspected cases/beds >20% or >10 deaths, and the total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 among residents and staff. Results: A total of 71% of the 13,167 nursing homes that reported COVID-19 data as of June 14 had at least one case among residents and/or staff. Of those, 27% experienced an outbreak. Higher registered nurse-hours are associated with a higher probability of experiencing any cases. However, among facilities with at least one case, higher nurse aide (NA) hours and total nursing hours are associated with a lower probability of experiencing an outbreak and with fewer deaths. The strongest predictor of cases and outbreaks in nursing homes is per capita cases in the county. Conclusion: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the community remains the strongest predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes, but higher NA hours and total nursing hours may help contain the number of cases and deaths.",covid
"Background: Cardiometabolic morbidity and medications, specifically Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs), have been linked with adverse outcomes from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aims to investigate, factors associated with COVID-19 positivity in hospital for 1,436 UK Biobank participants; compared with individuals who tested negative, and with the untested, presumed negative, rest of the cohort. Methods: We studied 7,099 participants from the UK Biobank who had been tested for COVID-19 in hospital. We considered the following exposures: age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, ACEi/ARB use, prior myocardial infarction (MI), and smoking. We undertook comparisons between (1) COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative tested participants; and (2) COVID-19 tested positive and the remaining participants (tested negative plus untested, n = 494,838). Logistic regression models were used to investigate univariate and mutually adjusted associations. Results: Among participants tested for COVID-19, Black, Asian, and Minority ethnic (BAME) ethnicity, male sex, and higher BMI were independently associated with a positive result. BAME ethnicity, male sex, greater BMI, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking were independently associated with COVID-19 positivity compared to the remaining cohort (test negatives plus untested). However, similar associations were observed when comparing those who tested negative for COVID-19 with the untested cohort; suggesting that these factors associate with general hospitalization rather than specifically with COVID-19. Conclusions: Among participants tested for COVID-19 with presumed moderate to severe symptoms in a hospital setting, BAME ethnicity, male sex, and higher BMI are associated with a positive result. Other cardiometabolic morbidities confer increased risk of hospitalization, without specificity for COVID-19. ACE/ARB use did not associate with COVID-19 status.",covid
"The Indian Armed Forces have always responded to the Nation's call and the COVID-19 pandemic response has been no different. On instructions from the Government of India, the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) pitched in right from the initial stages of the epidemic in India as part of a coordinated national response. Be it the execution of medical quarantine for Indian citizens evacuated from China and other COVID affected countries or establishing dedicated and mixed COVID hospitals for its own clientele as well as civilian patients, the AFMS worked in tandem with the national policies. The Armed Forces ensured force preservation and protection of its own troops and families by timely implementation of public health measures, even as it played its designated role in the national strategy.

"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant disruption to undergraduate medical education (UME). Although the immediate scheduling challenges are being addressed, there has been less discourse regarding how this pandemic will impact medical students in their preparation for and application to residency programs. While some historical disasters and pandemics provide a loose precedent for UME response during COVID-19, the impact of the current pandemic has surpassed any other events. COVID-19 will likely impact UME in the suspension of clinical rotations, alterations in grading, suspension or elimination of away rotations, changes in medical licensing exams, and ramifications on mental health. This review assesses governing medical bodies' recommendations regarding UME during the COVID-19 pandemic and how this may impact preparation for residency. In particular, residency programs will likely have to create new guidelines for assessing applicants during this unique cycle.",covid

We characterized the risk of COVID-19 amongst 226 patients exposed to healthcare workers with confirmed COVID-19; one patient may have been infected, suggesting that the risk of COVID-19 transmission from healthcare workers to patients is generally low.",covid
"We are on the brink of a public health crisis. Science is changing, medicine is evolving, politics are adapting as we are attempting to retain our “normal lives”. The origin of COVID-19 is not exclusively a medical or scientific one. Rather, it lingers more towards damaged public policies with a global pandemic surfacing as merely a consequence of failed economic and health strategies. In this paper we provide a narrative review of the evolution of COVID-19 with emphasis on the its origin and the place of physicians in an ethical perspective.",covid
"Because of in vitro studies, hydroxychloroquine has been evaluated as a preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and as a possible COVID-19 curative treatment. We report a case of COVID-19 in a patient with sarcoidosis who was receiving long-term hydroxychloroquine treatment and contracted COVID-19 despite adequate plasma concentrations.",covid
"Aims: To systematically review the currently available evidence investigating the association between olfactory dysfunction (OD) and the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). To analyse the prevalence of OD in patients who have tested positive on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID-19. To perform a meta-analysis of patients presenting with olfactory dysfunction, during the pandemic, and to investigate the positive predictive value for a COVID-19-positive result in this population. To assess whether olfactory dysfunction could be used as a diagnostic marker for COVID-19 positivity and aid public health approaches in tackling the current outbreak. Methods: We systematically searched MedLine (PubMed), Embase, Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC), Medrxiv, the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, NIHR Dissemination centre, Clinical Evidence, National Health Service Evidence and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence to identify the current published evidence which associates coronaviridae or similar RNA viruses with anosmia. The initial search identified 157 articles. A total of 145 papers were excluded following application of our exclusion criteria. The 12 remaining articles that presented evidence on the association between COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction were critically analysed. Results: Olfactory dysfunction has been shown to be the strongest predictor of COVID-19 positivity when compared to other symptoms in logistic regression analysis. In patients who had tested positive for COVID-19, there was a prevalence of 62% of OD. In populations of patients who are currently reporting OD, there is a positive predictive value of 61% for a positive COVID-19 result. Conclusion: Our review has shown that there is already significant evidence which demonstrates an association between OD and the novel coronavirus-COVID-19. It is unclear if this finding is unique to this coronavirus as individual viral phenotypes rarely present in such concentrated large numbers. We have demonstrated that OD is comparatively more predictive for COVID-19 positivity compared to other associated symptoms. We recommend that people who develop OD during the pandemic should be self-isolate and this guidance should be adopted internationally to prevent transmission.",covid
"Background: There is insufficient information about risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis and adverse outcomes from low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Objectives: We estimated the association between patients' characteristics and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome in Mexico. Methods: This retrospective case series used a publicly available nation-level dataset released on May 31, 2020 by the Mexican Ministry of Health, with patients classified as suspected cases of viral respiratory disease. Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalisation and adverse outcome, were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and hospitalisation and adverse outcome. Results: Overall, 236 439 patients were included, with 89 756 (38.0%) being diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8% were hospitalised and 13.0% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and hypertension were associated with hospitalisation and adverse outcome. Current smoking was not associated with adverse outcome. Conclusion: This largest ever case series of COVID-19 patients identified risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome. The findings could provide insight for the priorities the need to be set, especially by LMICs, to tackle the pandemic.",covid
"Background & objectives: Sentinel surveillance among severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) patients can help identify the spread and extent of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARI surveillance was initiated in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in India. We describe here the positivity for COVID-19 among SARI patients and their characteristics. Methods: SARI patients admitted at 41 sentinel sites from February 15, 2020 onwards were tested for COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, targeting E and RdRp genes of SARS-CoV-2. Data were extracted from Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory Network for analysis. Results: A total of 104 (1.8%) of the 5,911 SARI patients tested were positive for COVID-19. These cases were reported from 52 districts in 20 States/Union Territories. The COVID-19 positivity was higher among males and patients aged above 50 years. In all, 40 (39.2%) COVID-19 cases did not report any history of contact with a known case or international travel. Interpretation & conclusions: COVID-19 containment activities need to be targeted in districts reporting COVID-19 cases among SARI patients. Intensifying sentinel surveillance for COVID-19 among SARI patients may be an efficient tool to effectively use resources towards containment and mitigation efforts.",covid
"A question central to the Covid-19 pandemic is why the Covid-19 mortality rate varies so greatly across countries. This study aims to investigate factors associated with cross-country variation in Covid-19 mortality. Covid-19 mortality rate was calculated as number of deaths per 100 Covid-19 cases. To identify factors associated with Covid-19 mortality rate, linear regressions were applied to a cross-sectional dataset comprising 169 countries. We retrieved data from the Worldometer website, the Worldwide Governance Indicators, World Development Indicators, and Logistics Performance Indicators databases. Covid-19 mortality rate was negatively associated with Covid-19 test number per 100 people (RR = 0.92, P = 0.001), government effectiveness score (RR = 0.96, P = 0.017), and number of hospital beds (RR = 0.85, P < 0.001). Covid-19 mortality rate was positively associated with proportion of population aged 65 or older (RR = 1.12, P < 0.001) and transport infrastructure quality score (RR = 1.08, P = 0.002). Furthermore, the negative association between Covid-19 mortality and test number was stronger among low-income countries and countries with lower government effectiveness scores, younger populations and fewer hospital beds. Predicted mortality rates were highly associated with observed mortality rates (r = 0.77; P < 0.001). Increasing Covid-19 testing, improving government effectiveness and increasing hospital beds may have the potential to attenuate Covid-19 mortality.",covid
"Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged from China in 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide. Patients with metabolic comorbid conditions are more susceptible to infection by COVID-19. Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interlinked metabolic risk factors that predispose patients to increased risk of complications. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the aggressive form of NAFLD. Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between metabolic syndrome components and the risk of COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed data from a large commercial database (Explorys IBM) that aggregates electronic health records from 26 large nationwide healthcare systems. Using systemized nomenclature of clinical medical terms (SNOMED-CT), we identified adults with the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome and its individual components from 1999-2019. We included patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 from December 2019 to May 2020. Comorbidities known to be associated with COVID-19 and metabolic syndrome such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking, male gender, African American, and hypertension were collected. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to investigate whether metabolic syndrome or its individual components are independently associated with the risk of COVID-19. Results: Out of 61.4 million active adult patients in the database, 8,885 (0.01%) had documented COVID-19. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was higher if metabolic syndrome was the primary diagnosis (0.10% vs 0.01% %, OR 7.00 [6.11-8.01]). The adjusted odds (aOR) of having COVID-19 was higher in patients if they were African Americans (OR 7.45 [7.14- 7.77]), hypertensive (aOR 2.53 [2.40 - 2.68]), obese (aOR 2.20 [2.10 2.32]), diabetic (aOR 1.41 [1.33- 1.48]) hyperlipidemic (OR 1.70 [1.56-1.74]) or diagnosed with NASH (OR 4.93 [4.05- 6.00]). There was a slight decrease in adjusted odds of having COVID-19 in males as compared to females (aOR 0.88 [0.84- 0.92]). Conclusion: The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with metabolic syndrome is high. Among all comorbid metabolic conditions, NASH had the strongest association with COVID-19.",covid
"Background: Market vendors occupy a strategic position in the fight against the spread of SARS CoV-2 in rural Uganda. To successfully contain the spread of the virus, special attention needs to be given to this set of people by assessing the type of information, source of information, and practices they inculcate as regards adherence to WHO guidelines in the fight against COVID-19 in Uganda. The study aimed to assess the role of information sources, education level, and phone internet connectivity in influencing COVID-19 knowledge among the rural market vendors; and the relationship existing between knowledge, attitude, and practices among them. Methods: The study was a descriptive cross-sectional study among rural market vendors (n = 248) in southwestern Uganda. Information was collected using a questionnaire and descriptively presented as frequency and percentages. Results: The study showed that the majority of the rural market vendors had sufficient information regarding COVID-19 with the majority being female individuals and have attained a secondary level of education, The general percentage score for knowledge, attitude, and practices were (75.57, 82.6, and 76.50% respectively). There was a positive correlation between attitude and practices (r = 0.17, p = 0.007), as well as their knowledge with practices (r = 0.29, p < 0.001). The majority of the people in the population did not have their phones connected to the internet (OR = 1.96, 95%CI: 1.16-3.31, P = 0.01). The majority of people received their information regarding COVID-19 from one source (radio) (OR = 1.55). Conclusion: Where and how the rural market vendors get their information and education level are vital in breaking COVID 19 infection circle in line with WHO guidelines. Therefore, sources of information and education level played a key role in molding their knowledge and practices. However, the level of knowledge on COVID 19 among our respondents was not linked with phone internet connectivity.",covid
"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an ongoing global health emergency. The aim of our study was to investigate the changes of liver function and its clinical significance in COVID-19 patients. Method: This retrospective, single-centre study was conducted on 115 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University from 18 January 2020 to 22 February 2020. Liver function and related indexes were analysed to evaluate its relationship with disease progression in COVID-19 patients. Results: Part of the COVID-19 patients presented with varying degrees of abnormality in liver function indexes. However, the levels of ALT, AST, TBIL, GGT and LDH in COVID-19 patients were not significantly different when compared with hospitalised community-acquired pneumonia patients, and the levels of albumin is even significantly higher. The levels of ALT, AST, TBIL, LDH and INR showed statistically significant elevation in severe COVID-19 cases compared with that in mild cases. However, the clinical significance of the elevation is unremarkable. Majority of severe COVID-19 patients showed significantly decreasing in albumin level and continuously decreasing in the progress of illness. Most of the liver function indexes in COVID-19 patients were correlated with CRP and NLR, the markers of inflammation. Logistic regression analysis further identified NLR as the independent risk factor for severe COVID-19, as well as age. Conclusions: Although abnormalities of liver function indexes are common in COVID-19 patients, the impairment of liver function is not a prominent feature of COVID-19, and also may not have serious clinical consequences.",covid
"Background: Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 12,322,000 people and killed over 556,000 people worldwide. However, Differential diagnosis remains difficult for suspected cases of COVID-19 and need to be improved to reduce misdiagnosis. Methods: Sixty-eight cases of suspected COVID-19 treated in Wenzhou Central Hospital from January 21 to February 20, 2020 were divided into confirmed and COVID-19-negative groups based on the results of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid testing of the novel coronavirus in throat swab specimens to compare the clinical symptoms and laboratory and imaging results between the groups. Results: Among suspected patients, 17 were confirmed to COVID-19-positive group and 51 were distinguished to COVID-19-negative group. Patients with reduced white blood cell (WBC) count were more common in the COVID-19-positive group than in the COVID-19-negative group (29.4% vs 3.9%, P = 0.003). Subsequently, correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant inverse correlation existed between WBC count and temperature in the COVID-19-positive patients (r = - 0.587, P = 0.003), instead of the COVID-19-negative group. But reduced lymphocyte count was no different between the two groups (47.1% vs 25.5%, P = 0.096). More common chest imaging characteristics of the confirmed COVID-19 cases by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) included ground-glass opacities (GGOs), multiple patchy shadows, and consolidation with bilateral involvement than COVID-19-negative group (82.4% vs 31.4%, P = 0.0002; 41.2% vs 17.6% vs P = 0.048; 76.5% vs 43.1%, P = 0.017; respectively). The rate of clustered infection was higher in COVID-19-positive group than COVID-19-negative group (64.7% vs 7.8%, P = 0.001). Through multiplex PCR nucleic acid testing, 2 cases of influenza A, 3 cases of influenza B, 2 cases of adenovirus, 2 cases of Chlamydia pneumonia, and 7 cases of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were diagnosed in the COVID-19-negative group. Conclusions: WBC count inversely correlated with the severity of fever, GGOs, multiple patchy shadows, and consolidation in chest HRCT and clustered infection are common but not specific features in the confirmed COVID-19 group. Multiplex PCR nucleic acid testing helped differential diagnosis for suspected COVID-19 cases.",covid
"Purpose of review: The alarming number of confirmed COVID-19 cases put a strain on the healthcare systems, which had to reallocate human and technical resources to respond to the emergency. Many urologists became integrated into multidisciplinary teams, dealing with this respiratory illness and its unknown management. It aims to summarize the epidemiological, clinical, diagnostical, and therapeutical characteristics of COVID-19, from a practical perspective, to ease COVID-19 management to non-physician staff. Recent findings: We performed a narrative review of the literature regarding COVID-19, updated to May 8th, 2020, at PubMed and COVID resource platforms of the main scientific editorials. COVID-19, characterized by fever, myalgias, dyspnea, and dry cough, varies widely from asymptomatic infection to death. Arrhythmias and thrombotic events are prevalent. Lymphopenia and inflammatory reactant elevation on laboratory, as well as bilateral and peripheral ground-glass opacities or consolidations on X-Ray, are usually found in its assessment. Little is known about SARS-CoV-2 immunology. To date, no therapy has demonstrated efficacy in COVID-19. Of-level or compassionate-use therapies are prescribed in the context of clinical trials. We should become familiar with specific adverse events and pharmacological interactions. The COVID-19 pandemic has paralyzed the urological activity, and its long-term consequences are unpredictable. Despite not being used to deal with respiratory diseases, the urologists become easily qualified to manage COVID-19 by following protocols and being integrated into multidisciplinary teams, helping to overcome the pandemic.",covid
"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to ascertain COVID-19 transmission dynamics among Latino communities nationally. Methods: We compared predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths between disproportionally Latino counties (≥17.8% Latino population) and all other counties through May 11, 2020. Adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated binomial regression models. Results: COVID-19 diagnoses rates were greater in Latino counties nationally (90.9 vs. 82.0 per 100,000). In multivariable analysis, COVID-19 cases were greater in Northeastern and Midwestern Latino counties (aRR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.11-1.84, and aRR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.57-1.85, respectively). COVID-19 deaths were greater in Midwestern Latino counties (aRR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.04-1.34). COVID-19 diagnoses were associated with counties with greater monolingual Spanish speakers, employment rates, heart disease deaths, less social distancing, and days since the first reported case. COVID-19 deaths were associated with household occupancy density, air pollution, employment, days since the first reported case, and age (fewer <35 yo). Conclusions: COVID-19 risks and deaths among Latino populations differ by region. Structural factors place Latino populations and particularly monolingual Spanish speakers at elevated risk for COVID-19 acquisition.",covid
"Malaria remains a major global health burden, killing hundreds of thousands annually, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019, a Phase IV Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)-linked malaria vaccine implementation was underway. However, in December 2019, a novel pneumonia condition termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with many clinical, epidemiological, and biological parallels to malaria, was reported in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is spreading rapidly, and, as of the 3rd of June, 2020, more than 382,507 persons had died from COVID-19. Children under 5 years who suffer high malaria-attributable mortalities are largely asymptomatic for COVID-19. Considering that the malaria burden is highest in low-income tropical countries with little capacity to fund malaria control and eradication programs, the fight against malaria in these regions is likely to be hampered. Access to healthcare has generally been limited, while malaria interventions, such as seasonal malaria chemotherapy and distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets, have been suspended due to lockdowns. Likewise, the repurposing of antimalarials for treatment of COVID-19 shared symptoms and the shift in focus from the production of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to COVID-19 RDTs is a cause for concern in malaria-endemic regions. Children are less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the elderly. However, due to the fears of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the elderly who are worst affected by COVID-19 may not take children for malaria medication, resulting in high malaria-related mortalities among children. COVID-19 has disproportionately affected developed countries, threatening their donation capacity. These are likely to thwart malaria control efforts in low-income regions. Here, we present perspectives on the collateral impact of COVID-19 on malaria, especially in Africa.",covid
"Background: Recently, COVID-19 infection has become a public health concern. On March 12th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced it as a global pandemic. Early diagnosis of atypical cases of COVID-19 infection is critical in reducing the transmission and controlling the present pandemic. In the present report, we described a patient with the chief complaints of dyspnea and dry cough referred to the oncology center at Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran with the differential diagnosis of lung cancer who was diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 infection in follow up. Case presentation: A 59-year-old patient complained of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea from two weeks ago. The patient had been referred to this center with the differential diagnosis of lung cancer due to the massive pleural effusion in initial chest CT scan. Dyspnea was the patient's main complaint at the time of admission in this center and the oxygen saturation was 84%. In the new chest CT scan, similar findings were observed. Due to the severe respiratory distress, a chest tube was placed in the chest cavity to remove the pleural effusion fluid on day one. The patient's felt relieved immediately after the procedure; however, the oxygen saturation did not raise above 85% despite the oxygen therapy. The cytology of pleural fluid was negative for malignant cells. On day 2, the lymphopenia and high level of CRP suggested the COVID-19 infection. Therefore, a control chest CT scan was conducted and the test for COVID-19 was performed. The CT report indicated the clear pattern of COVID-19's lung involvement in the absence of pleural effusion. Thus, the treatment for COVID-19 was immediately initiated. On day 4, the test reported positive for COVID-19. Conclusion: Currently, it is important to bear in mind the COVID-19 infection in evaluating the patients with respiratory symptoms. This report indicated how misleading the presentation of chest CT scan could be in clinical judgment. Therefore, we recommend ruling out the COVID-19 infection in all the patients with any pattern of lung involvement to avoid missing the potential cases of this vicious infection.",covid
"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-Cov-2, resulting in severe acute respiratory syndrome, with high potential of spreading and infecting humans worldwide. Since December 2019, when the virus was identified in humans, the literature on COVID-19 has grown exponentially and extrarespiratory symptoms including neurologic symptoms are increasingly highlighted. Methods: Given the high and increasing number of publications reporting neurologic involvements of SARS-Cov-2, we thought that providing an update for neurologic complications of COVID-19 would be useful for physicians and especially young trainees in neurology and neurosurgery. Indeed, in this review we discuss several neurologic aspects reported in the literature to date including the evidence and pathways of neuroinvasion in COVID-19 and the main neurologic disorders reported in the literature to date, as well as future perspectives and the potential long-term consequence of current neuroinfection in COVID-19 patients. Results: Currently, there is convincing evidence that SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, can affect the nervous system, with damage and neurologic alterations. These neurologic disorders are grouped into several categories, ranging from nonspecific and moderate symptoms such as headache, myalgia, and hyposmia to severe symptoms including cerebrovascular disease and intracranial infections. Severe neurologic symptoms such as acute cerebrovascular disease occur only in a minority of patients with usual risk factors and are associated with poor outcome. However, most COVID-19 patients exhibit only minor or mild neurologic symptoms. Conclusions: Management of COVID-19 patients should include early clinical, radiologic, and laboratory neurologic assessment, with a close follow-up, especially in severe forms. Future studies should assess late and long-term consequences of current COVID-19 patients with neurologic involvement.",covid
"In early December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first emerged in Wuhan, China. As of May 10th, 2020, a total of over 4 million COVID-19 cases and 280,000 deaths have been reported globally, reflecting the raised infectivity and severity of this virus. Amongst hospitalised COVID-19 patients, there is a high prevalence of established cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is evidence showing that COVID-19 may exacerbate cardiovascular risk factors and preexisting CVD or may lead to cardiovascular complications. With intensive care units operating at maximum capacity and such staggering mortality rates reported, it is imperative during this time-sensitive COVID-19 outbreak to identify patients with an increased risk of adverse outcomes and/or myocardial injury. Preliminary findings from COVID-19 studies have shown the association of biomarkers of acute cardiac injury and coagulation with worse prognosis. While these biomarkers are recognised for CVD, there is emerging prospect that they may aid prognosis in COVID-19, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or risk factors that predispose to worse outcomes. Consequently, the aim of this review is to identify cardiovascular prognostic factors associated with morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 and to highlight considerations for incorporating laboratory testing of biomarkers of cardiovascular performance in COVID-19 to optimise outcomes.",covid
"The management of the COVID-19 pandemic presents several unprecedented challenges in different fields, from medicine to biology, from public health to social science, that may benefit from computing methods able to integrate the increasing available COVID-19 and related data (e.g., pollution, demographics, climate, etc.). With the aim to face the COVID-19 data collection, harmonization and integration problems, we present the design and development of COVID-WAREHOUSE, a data warehouse that models, integrates and stores the COVID-19 data made available daily by the Italian Protezione Civile Department and several pollution and climate data made available by the Italian Regions. After an automatic ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Loading) step, COVID-19 cases, pollution measures and climate data, are integrated and organized using the Dimensional Fact Model, using two main dimensions: time and geographical location. COVID-WAREHOUSE supports OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) analysis, provides a heatmap visualizer, and allows easy extraction of selected data for further analysis. The proposed tool can be used in the context of Public Health to underline how the pandemic is spreading, with respect to time and geographical location, and to correlate the pandemic to pollution and climate data in a specific region. Moreover, public decision-makers could use the tool to discover combinations of pollution and climate conditions correlated to an increase of the pandemic, and thus, they could act in a consequent manner. Case studies based on data cubes built on data from Lombardia and Puglia regions are discussed. Our preliminary findings indicate that COVID-19 pandemic is significantly spread in regions characterized by high concentration of particulate in the air and the absence of rain and wind, as even stated in other works available in literature.",covid
"Background: Zinc is a trace element with potent immunoregulatory, antiviral properties and is utilized in the treatment of COVID-19. However, we do not know the clinical significance of serum Zinc level in COVID-19 patients. Aim: To determine the clinical significance of serum Zinc in COVID-19 patients and to establish a correlation with disease severity. Methodology: A prospective study on COVID-19 patients underwent fasting Zinc level at the time of hospitalisation. An initial comparative analysis was carried out between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Zinc deficiency COVID-19 patients were compared to those with normal levels. Results: COVID-19 patients (n = 47) showed significantly low Zinc levels compared to healthy controls (n = 45), median 74.5 (IQR 53.4-94.6) vs 105.8 (IQR 95.65120.90) µg/dl, P < 0.001. Amongst COVID-19 positive patients, 27 (57.4%) were found Zinc deficient. These patients were found to have higher complications (P = 0.009), ARDS (18.5% vs 0%, P = 0.06), received corticosteroid therapy (P = 0.02), prolonged hospital stay (P = 0.05) and increased mortality (18.5% vs 0%, P = 0.06). The Odds ratio (OR) of developing complications in Zinc deficient COVID-19 patients was 5.54. Conclusion: Our data clearly shows that significant number of COVID-19 patients are Zinc deficient. These Zinc deficient patients developed more complications with prolonged hospital stay and were associated with increased mortality.",covid
"Background: Clinical recovery does not mean full recovery. It is necessary to explore the aftereffects of COVID-19 in patients and compare the laboratory features of COVID-19 and other viral pneumonias in the recovery stages. Methods: Forty-seven cases of COVID-19 and 45 cases of other viral pneumonias (control) were included in this study. The laboratory parameters were compared between COVID-19 and control patients as well as severe and moderate COVID-19 patients from the clinical recovery stage to the 4 weeks postdischarge recovery stage. Results: A higher RDW-CV level and neutrophil percentage and lower levels of total proteins, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and MCH were found in COVID-19 patients compared with those in controls from the clinical recovery to the postdischarge recovery stages. Further analysis showed that decreases in lymphocytes, total proteins, and SOD and elevations in neutrophils, FDP, CRP, and ESR were more common in severe than moderate cases of COVID-19 during hospitalization; however, differences in these indicators, except total proteins, were not observed in the postdischarge recovery stages. Additionally, only 76.9% of COVID-19 patients were positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the convalescence stage, and one patient that was negative for specific IgG was reinfected. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that patients recovering from COVID-19 might need better care than that patients with other viral pneumonias due to the possibility of having poor immunity and nutritional conditions. These findings provide new insights to improve the understanding of COVID-19 and improve care for patients affected by these kinds of pandemics in the future.",covid
"Background: Even at present, we are in the middle of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and are facing challenges in trial and error. Presently, emergency surgery for patients with suspected COVID-19 is burdensome not only for patients but also for healthcare workers. Therefore, we established a surveillance system in the emergency room and established principles for managing patients suspected of COVID-19 who require emergency surgery. Case summary: A 67-year-old man was diagnosed with appendicitis in March 2020. His wife was diagnosed with COVID-19 10 d earlier, and the patient was in close contact with her. The patient tested negative twice on an upper respiratory COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction screening test, but chest X-ray and chest computed tomography revealed patchy ground-glass opacity in both upper lobes of the patient's lungs. The same emergency surgery procedure for patients with confirmed COVID-19 was applied to this patient suspected of having the disease to ensure that surgery was not delayed while waiting for the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results. A few hours after surgery, the upper respiratory tract specimen taken in the emergency room was negative for COVID-19 but the lower respiratory tract specimen was found to be positive for the disease. Conclusion: When COVID-19 is suspected, emergency surgery should be performed as for confirmed COVID-19 without delay.",covid
"Background: COVID-19 is a public health emergency that is spreading worldwide and seriously affecting the global economy. Date on the effectiveness and safety of the use of methylprednisolone for patients with severe COVID-19 remains limited. Methods: In this retrospective study, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcomes data of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to March 7, 2020, were collected. Binary logistic regression model was use to analyse risk factors for disease progression from severe COVID-19 illness to critical illness. The effectiveness and safety of the use of methylprednisolone for patients with severe COVID-19 disease were evaluated. Results: The results of the multivariate analysis from 175 patients with severe COVID-19 indicate that the use of methylprednisolone was a protective factor against disease progression from severe to critical illness(P<0.001; OR: 0.054 95% CI: 0.017-0.173). Among patients with severe COVID-19 aged<65 years, both the proportion of patients who progressed to critical illness (42.2% vs 90.0%, P=0.000) and the mortality(6.7% vs 30.0%, P=0.002) were lower for patients in methylprednisolone group, compared with those in the non-methylprednisolone group, whereas no statistical differences between the methylprednisolone group and the non-methylprednisolone group were found among COVID-19 patients older than 65 years. Moreover, both the levels of CD4+ T lymphocyte counts (646 vs 463/ul, P=0.007) and IL-6(241.9 vs 82.8pg/ml, P=0.025) were higher among patients with severe COVID-19 aged<65 years, compared with those patients ≥65 years old. Conclusion: Data from the limited sample showed that the early use of low or medium doses of methylprednisolone have a positive effect for patients with severe COVID-19 younger than 65 years old, and excessive immune response and cytokine storm may be some of the reasons for the effectiveness.",covid
"Background: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of COVID-19 outbreak on congenital cardiac surgery practice in a single center. Methods: The first case of COVID-19 in our country was seen on March 11th, 2020. The patients operated between March 11th, 2019-and March 10th, 2020 were taken as the pre-COVID group, and those operated between March 11th and May 11th, 2020 were taken as the COVID group. The data was retrospectively collected, and the two periods were compared. Results: Monthly average number of cases which was 52 patients/month (626 patients in 12 months) before COVID decreased to 35 patients/month (70 patients in 2 months) during COVID periods (P < .01). During the pre-COVID period the median postoperative length of hospital stay was 3 (IQR: 1-5) days. During the COVID period, this decreased to 1 (IQR: 1-3) day (P < .01). During the pre-COVID period, the hospital expenses of 17% (8/47) of the foreign nationals were covered by their homeland. The remaining 83% (39/47) were paid from the asylum seekers' fund. The proportion of foreign nationals operated significantly decreased during the COVID period ([7%; 47/632 vs 1%; 1/70]; P = .04). No significant difference was observed in terms of STAT mortality scores and categories and postoperative results of the operations performed between the two periods. Conclusions: Congenital cardiac surgery practice can be safely maintained with restricted case volume during the pandemic period. It is alarming that patients in the deprived areas cannot access pediatric cardiac surgery and possibly other health services because of closure of the borders between countries.",covid
"Objective: To provide estimates of the relative rate of COVID-19 death in people <65 years old versus older individuals in the general population, the absolute risk of COVID-19 death at the population level during the first epidemic wave, and the proportion of COVID-19 deaths in non-elderly people without underlying diseases in epicenters of the pandemic. Eligible data: Cross-sectional survey of countries and US states with at least 800 COVID-19 deaths as of April 24, 2020 and with information on the number of deaths in people with age <65. Data were available for 14 countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK) and 13 US states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania). We also examined available data on COVID-19 deaths in people with age <65 and no underlying diseases. Main outcome measures: Proportion of COVID-19 deaths in people <65 years old; relative mortality rate of COVID-19 death in people <65 versus ≥65 years old; absolute risk of COVID-19 death in people <65 and in those ≥80 years old in the general population as of June 17, 2020; absolute COVID-19 mortality rate expressed as equivalent of mortality rate from driving a motor vehicle. Results: Individuals with age <65 account for 4.5-11.2% of all COVID-19 deaths in European countries and Canada, 8.3-22.7% in the US locations, and were the majority in India and Mexico. People <65 years old had 30- to 100-fold lower risk of COVID-19 death than those ≥65 years old in 11 European countries and Canada, 16- to 52-fold lower risk in US locations, and less than 10-fold in India and Mexico. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death as of June 17, 2020 for people <65 years old in high-income countries ranged from 10 (Germany) to 349 per million (New Jersey) and it was 5 per million in India and 96 per million in Mexico. The absolute risk of COVID-19 death for people ≥80 years old ranged from 0.6 (Florida) to 17.5 per thousand (Connecticut). The COVID-19 mortality rate in people <65 years old during the period of fatalities from the epidemic was equivalent to the mortality rate from driving between 4 and 82 miles per day for 13 countries and 5 states, and was higher (equivalent to the mortality rate from driving 106-483 miles per day) for 8 other states and the UK. People <65 years old without underlying predisposing conditions accounted for only 0.7-3.6% of all COVID-19 deaths in France, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Georgia, and New York City and 17.7% in Mexico. Conclusions: People <65 years old have very small risks of COVID-19 death even in pandemic epicenters and deaths for people <65 years without underlying predisposing conditions are remarkably uncommon. Strategies focusing specifically on protecting high-risk elderly individuals should be considered in managing the pandemic.",covid
"Background and purpose: The 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak and its associated disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) have created a worldwide pandemic. Early data suggest higher rate of ischemic stroke in severe COVID-19 infection. We evaluated whether a relationship exists between emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO) and the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: This is a retrospective, observational case series. Data were collected from all patients who presented with ELVO to the Mount Sinai Health System Hospitals across New York City during the peak 3 weeks of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Patients' demographic, comorbid conditions, cardiovascular risk factors, COVID-19 disease status, and clinical presentation were extracted from the electronic medical record. Comparison was made between COVID-19 positive and negative cohorts. The incidence of ELVO stroke was compared with the pre-COVID period. Results: Forty-five consecutive ELVO patients presented during the observation period. Fifty-three percent of patients tested positive for COVID-19. Total patients' mean (±SD) age was 66 (±17). Patients with COVID-19 were significantly younger than patients without COVID-19, 59±13 versus 74±17 (odds ratio [95% CI], 0.94 [0.81-0.98]; P=0.004). Seventy-five percent of patients with COVID-19 were male compared with 43% of patients without COVID-19 (odds ratio [95% CI], 3.99 [1.12-14.17]; P=0.032). Patients with COVID-19 were less likely to be White (8% versus 38% [odds ratio (95% CI), 0.15 (0.04-0.81); P=0.027]). In comparison to a similar time duration before the COVID-19 outbreak, a 2-fold increase in the total number of ELVO was observed (estimate: 0.78 [95% CI, 0.47-1.08], P≤0.0001). Conclusions: More than half of the ELVO stroke patients during the peak time of the New York City's COVID-19 outbreak were COVID-19 positive, and those patients with COVID-19 were younger, more likely to be male, and less likely to be White. Our findings also suggest an increase in the incidence of ELVO stroke during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak.",covid
"Analyzing new nationwide data from the Understanding Society COVID-19 survey (N = 10,336), this research examines intersecting ethnic and native-migrant inequalities in the impact of COVID-19 on people's economic well-being in the UK. The results show that compared with UK-born white British, black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) migrants in the UK are more likely to experience job loss during the COVID-19 lockdown, while BAME natives are less likely to enjoy employment protection such as furloughing. Although UK-born white British are more likely to reduce their work hours during the COVID-19 pandemic than BAME migrants, they are less likely to experience income loss and face increased financial hardship during the pandemic than BAME migrants. The findings show that the pandemic exacerbates entrenched socio-economic inequalities along intersecting ethnic and native-migrant lines. They urge governments and policy makers to place racial justice at the center of policy developments in response to the pandemic.",covid
"COVID-19 typically presents as severe pneumonia often requiring intubation and ICU management. Descriptions of the potential neurological symptoms in this disease state exist, but minimal research has been conducted on the prevalence of delirium. This case report describes a patient with no past psychiatric history who developed psychotic symptoms in the context of acute COVID-19 delirium. Clinicians should consider COVID-19 in their differential diagnosis with any patient who presents with psychotic symptoms, even in the absence of the typical COVID-19 symptoms of cough or fever. Rule out of COVID-19 via PCR should be completed on any new delirium case, and appropriate isolation of psychiatric patients should occur until negative results are obtained.",covid
"On February 5 the Japanese government ordered the passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess to start a two week quarantine after a former passenger tested positive for COVID-19. During the quarantine the virus spread rapidly throughout the ship. By February 20, there were 651 cases. We model this quarantine with a SEIR model including asymptomatic infections with differentiated shipboard roles for crew and passengers. The study includes the derivation of the basic reproduction number and simulation studies showing the effect of quarantine with COVID-19 or influenza on the total infection numbers. We show that quarantine on a ship with COVID-19 will lead to significant disease spread if asymptomatic infections are not identified. However, if the majority of the crew and passengers are immune or vaccinated to COVID-19, then quarantine would slow the spread. We also show that a disease similar to influenza, even with a ship with a fully susceptible crew and passengers, could be contained through quarantine measures.",covid
"COVID-19 has turned the world upside down in a very short period of time. The impact of COVID-19 will disproportionately effect people who are least able to protect themselves and this will include people who use drugs. The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic comes at time when North America is in the midst of a protracted overdose epidemic caused by a toxic illegal drug supply. Overdose deaths are likely to rise when people are isolated, social support programs are cut back, and the illicit drug supply is further compromised. Safer opioid distribution in response to a toxic street drug supply is a pragmatic and effective way to reduce overdose deaths. COVID-19 makes such an approach even more urgent and compelling.",covid
"As a highly infectious respiratory tract disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause respiratory, physical, and psychological dysfunction in patients. Therefore, pulmonary rehabilitation is crucial for both admitted and discharged patients of COVID-19. In this study, based on the newly released pulmonary rehabilitation guidelines for patients with COVID-19, as well as evidence from the pulmonary rehabilitation of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, we investigated pulmonary rehabilitation for patients with COVID-19 having complications, such as chronic pulmonary disease, and established an intelligent respiratory rehabilitation model for these patients.",covid

"Background: The main pathophysiological basis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causing respiratory failure is a cytokine storm and interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important component of the COVID-19 cytokine storm. As a specific antagonist of IL-6, tocilizumab may block the cytokine storm of COVID-19. The Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (7th Edition) includes tocilizumab as a recommended drug for immunotherapy in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. However, the specific clinical efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is worth studying. Aim: To determine the clinical efficacy of tocilizumab in inhibiting the cytokine storm in COVID-19. Methods: In total, 19 severe and critical COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study, and were treated with tocilizumab in Optical Valley Campus of Hubei Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital from February 20 to March 31, 2020. The imaging manifestations and clinical data before and after treatment were analyzed retrospectively, including routine peripheral venous blood tests, routine blood biochemical tests, coagulation test, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, and arterial blood gas analysis. Results: Of the 19 patients in this group, 13 (68.4%) had significantly improved symptoms of COVID-19 (5 patients were discharged directly and 8 patients were transferred after improvement) following treatment. One case was invalid, 1 case was exacerbated, and 4 deaths (21.1%) were observed (all critical cases). The lymphocyte count, CRP, lactic acid, oxygenation index, fibrinogen (FIB) and IL-6 levels were significantly different in the improved group. Conclusion: Tocilizumab treatment is effective against IL-6 in COVID-19 patients, but it does not completely inhibit the inflammation and cytokine storm in all patients with COVID-19.In the clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients, attention should be paid to the timing of drug administration and other adjuvant treatments.",covid
"Importance: The proportion of daily wearers of eyeglasses among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is small, and the association between daily wear of eyeglasses and COVID-19 susceptibility has not been reported. Objective: To study the association between the daily wearing of eyeglasses and the susceptibility to COVID-19. Design, setting, and participants: This cohort study enrolled all inpatients with COVID-19 in Suizhou Zengdu Hospital, Suizhou, China, a designated hospital for COVID-19 treatment in the area, from January 27 to March 13, 2020. COVID-19 was diagnosed according to the fifth edition of Chinese COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines. The proportion of persons with myopia who wore eyeglasses in Hubei province was based on data from a previous study. Exposures: Daily wearing of eyeglasses for more than 8 hours. Main outcomes and measures: The main outcomes were the proportions of daily wearers of eyeglasses among patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 and among the local population. Data on exposure history, clinical symptoms, underlying diseases, duration of wearing glasses, and myopia status and the proportion of people with myopia who wore eyeglasses in Hubei province were collected. People who wore glasses for more than 8 hours a day were defined as long-term wearers. Results: A total of 276 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Of these, 155 (56.2%) were male, and the median age was 51 (interquartile range, 41-58) years. All those who wore glasses for more than 8 hours a day had myopia and included 16 of 276 patients (5.8%; 95% CI, 3.04%-8.55%). The proportion of people with myopia in Hubei province, based on a previous study, was 31.5%, which was much higher than the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who had myopia in this sample. Conclusions and relevance: In this cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Suizhou, China, the proportion of inpatients with COVID-19 who wore glasses for extended daily periods (>8 h/d) was smaller than that in the general population, suggesting that daily wearers of eyeglasses may be less susceptible to COVID-19.",covid
"Purpose: There have been nearly 200,000 deaths worldwide so far from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Cancer history appears to be a poor prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients, although the reasons for this are unclear. In this report, we assess whether extent of prior lung irradiation is a risk factor for death as a result of COVID-19 infection. Methods and materials: Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 14 and April 15, 2020, at our institution and who previously received radiation therapy for cancer in our department were included in this analysis. Patient characteristics and metrics describing the extent of lung irradiation were tabulated. Cox regression models were used to identify predictors of death after COVID-19 diagnosis. A logistic model was used to characterize the association between mean lung radiation therapy dose and 14-day mortality risk after COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: For the study, 107 patients met the inclusion criteria. With a median follow-up of 7 days from COVID-19 diagnosis for surviving patients, 24 deaths have been observed. The actuarial survival rate 14 days after COVID-19 testing is 66%. Increasing mean lung dose (hazard ratio [HR] per Gy = 1.1, P = .002), lung cancer diagnosis (HR = 3.0, P = .034), and receiving radiation therapy between 1 month and 1 year before COVID-19 testing (HR = 3.4, P = .013) were associated with increased risk of death. Our survival model demonstrates a near linear relationship between mortality risk after COVID-19 diagnosis and mean lung radiation therapy dose. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with a history of radiation therapy for cancer have a poor prognosis, and mortality risk appears to be associated with extent of lung irradiation. Validation of these findings will be critical as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.",covid
"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant motor, cognitive, psychological, neurological and cardiological disabilities in many infected patients. Functional rehabilitation of infectious COVID-19 patients has been implemented in the acute care wards and in appropriate, ad hoc, multidisciplinary COVID-19 rehabilitation units. However, because COVID-19 rehabilitation units are a clinical novelty, clinical and organizational benchmarks are not yet available. The aim of this study is to describe the organizational needs and operational costs of such a unit, by comparing its activity, organization, and costs with 2 other functional rehabilitation units, in San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy. Methods: The 2-month activity of the COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit at San Raffaele Hospital, Milan, Italy, which was created in response to the emergency need for rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients, was compared with the previous year's activity of the Cardiac Rehabilitation and Motor Rehabilitation Units of the same institute. Results: The COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit had the same number of care beds as the other units, but required twice the amount of staff and instrumental equipment, leading to a deficit in costs. Discussion: The COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit was twice as expensive as the 2 other units studied. World health systems are organizing to respond to the pandemic by expanding capacity in acute intensive care and sub-intensive care units. This study shows that COVID-19 rehabilitation units must be organized and equiped according to the clinical and rehabilitative needs of patients, following specific measures to prevent the spread of infection amongs patients and workers.",covid
"The new coronavirus (COVID-19) infection reported in China in December 2019 has become a pandemic in a few weeks, affecting the entire world. In this respect, it is crucial to determine the case-increase, case-fatality, and case-recovery rates to control COVID-19. In this study, the case-increase, case-fatality, and case-recovery rates of COVID-19 in 36 European countries were analyzed with the meta-analysis method using data released by the health organizations and WHO. The data were obtained from the website of health organizations of 36 European countries and the website of WHO until 11 May 2020. The analyses were carried out on 1 744 704 COVID-19-diagnosed cases in 36 European countries. The case-increase, case-fatality and case-recovery rates of COVID-19 were calculated using 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), single-arm meta-analysis, cross-temporal meta-analysis, and meta-regression random-effects model. The standardized case-increase rate of COVID-19 is 5% (95% CI [0.040, 0.063]) and the average case-increase rate in European countries has started to decline by around 3% (95% CI [0.047, 0.083]) weekly. The countries with the highest rate of case increase are Belgium, Sweden, Russia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Although the case-fatality rate of COVID-19 patients was 4.5% as of May 11 (95% CI [0.037-0.055]), this rate is 6.3% (95% CI [0.047, 0.083]) in standardized time (6th week). The case-recovery rates of patients are 46% (95% CI [0.376-0.547]). This study presents important results regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Although the rate of increase in new COVID-19 cases has dropped, there is not much decline in the case-fatality rates and no increase in case-recovery rates. The case-fatality rate of COVID-19 in Europe was estimated to be in the range of 4% to 4.5% and a minimum of 4 weeks (as of 11 May) is expected to have the figure below 1% in a country with an average case-increase rate. Monitoring case fatalities in Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden, and treatment successes in Germany and Austria play a role of utmost importance.",covid
"Introduction: Multiple anecdotal reports suggest that smell and taste loss were early subclinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients. The objective of this review was to identify the incidence of smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19, determine the onset of their symptoms and the risk factors of anosmia, hyposmia, ageusia or dysgeusia for COVID-19 infection. Methods: We searched the PubMed and Google Scholar on 15th May 2020, with search terms including SARS-COV-2, coronavirus, COVID-19, hyposmia, anosmia, ageusia and dysgeusia. The articles included were cross sectional studies, observational studies and retrospective or prospective audits, letters to editor and short communications that included a study of a cohort of patients. Case reports, case-series and interventional studies were excluded. Discussion: A total of 16 studies were selected. Incidence of smell and taste dysfunction was higher in Europe (34 to 86%), North America (19 to 71%) and the Middle East (36 to 98%) when compared to the Asian cohorts (11 to 15%) in COVID-19 positive patients. Incidence of smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19 negative patients was low in comparison (12 to 27%). Total incidence of smell and taste dysfunction from COVID-19 positive and negative patients from seven studies was 20% and 10% respectively. Symptoms may appear just before, concomitantly, or immediately after the onset of the usual symptoms. Occurs predominantly in females. When occurring immediately after the onset of the usual symptoms, the median time of onset was 3.3 to 4.4 days. Symptoms persist for a period of seven to 14 days. Patients with smell and taste dysfunction were reported to have a six to ten-fold odds of having COVID-19. Conclusion: Smell and taste dysfunction has a high incidence in Europe, North America, and the Middle East. The incidence was lower in the Asia region. It is a strong risk factor for COVID-19. It may be the only symptom and should be added to the list of symptoms when screening for COVID- 19.",covid
"Background: Heart-fatty acid binding protein (HFABP) has been recognized as a highly heart-specific marker. However, it is currently unknown that its HFABP is also closely related to the severity of COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively screened 46 patients who met our inclusion criteria within 4 weeks. They were tested for HFABP after the diagnosis of COVID-19, and monitored for HFABP during their hospital stay. We tracked the patients during their hospital stay to determine if they had severe COVID-19 or mild-to-severe transition features. We calculated the chi-square test values found for HFABP to predict the correlation between HFABP levels and the severity of the COVID-19. Results: Of these 46 cases, 16 cases with confirmed COVID-19 were tested for HFABP> 7 ng / mL upon admission; among them, 14 cases were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 within the hospitalization. The Odds ratio of the measured HFABP elevation was 6.81(95% confidence interval [CI] 5.23-8.40), and 3 patients with severe COVID-19 progressed in 5 patients with mild HFABP> 7 ng/mL. Conclusion: These data indicate that the elevation of HFABP is closely related to the severity of COVID-19 in the patients, and the elevated HFABP may cause rapid development of patients with mild COVID-19 into severe COVID-19. But serum HFABP negative maybe make patients with mild COVID-19 safer, the current data show no effect on the all-cause mortality.

"COVID-19-related controversies concerning the allocation of scarce resources, travel restrictions, and physical distancing norms each raise a foundational question: How should authority, and thus responsibility, over healthcare and public health law and policy be allocated? Each controversy raises principles that support claims by traditional wielders of authority in ""federal"" countries, like federal and state governments, and less traditional entities, like cities and sub-state nations. No existing principle divides ""healthcare and public law and policy"" into units that can be allocated in intuitively compelling ways. This leads to puzzles concerning (a) the principles for justifiably allocating ""powers"" in these domains and (b) whether and how they change during ""emergencies.""

"Governments are being put to the test as they struggle with the fast and wide spread of COVID-19. This article discusses the compelling challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic by examining how this wicked problem has been managed by the South Korean government with agile-adaptive, transparent actions to mitigate the surge of COVID-19. Unlike many Western countries, South Korea has been able to contain the spread of COVID-19 without a harsh forced lockdown of the epicenter of the virus. This essay argues that an agile-adaptive approach, a policy of transparency in communicating risk, and citizens' voluntary cooperation are critical factors. It also suggests that the South Korean government learned costly lessons from the MERS failure of 2015. This essay suggests ways that Western countries can manage future wicked problems such as COVID-19 without paying too much cost and maintaining quality of life in open and free societies.",covid

This review aims to summarize currently available data about prevalence, possible pathophysiological mechanisms and management of patients with diabetes and COVID-19.",covid
"Despite the extent of the COVID-19 infection worldwide, the impact of the pandemic in our country remains low thanks to containment measures. On July 11, 2020, the spread of the virus in Morocco has caused more than 15,000 cases and 243 deaths. It is important to note that cancer patients are at high risk of developing COVID-19 disease. However, little changes have been made in our clinical practice in cancer management. Medical care aims are to ensure optimal treatment while minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Management should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting, and any decision made, particularly influenced by the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, should be discussed and shared with the patient. In this article, we summarize our practical recommendations and how we prioritize cancer patient care during the post-COVID-19 phase.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many undesirable effects, including death. The COVID-19 outbreak occurred suddenly, and many countries were ill prepared to face it. Community behaviour has been altered due to the pandemic. Uncertainty surrounding the disease triggered panic buying; public panic caused additional worry about limited food supplies, and thus demand increased. World economies have also felt the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. Owing to the measures put in place to address the spread of COVID-19, many service providers and industries were closed, resulting in financial losses, and the risk of unemployment was elevated, which inevitably increased negative emotions in individuals. A psychosocial consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is worldwide fear. Because psychological defence is a supporting factor for the recovery of COVID-19 patients, it is important to encourage prevention of mental stress. Psychotherapy is able to provide counselling services to the community through teleconsultation. Strengthening psychological defences can help countries fight against this disease.",covid
"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a serious illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The symptoms of the disease range from asymptomatic to mild respiratory symptoms and even potentially life-threatening cardiovascular and pulmonary complications. Cardiac complications include acute myocardial injury, arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock and even sudden death. Furthermore, drug interactions with COVID-19 therapies may place the patient at risk for arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and sudden death. In this review, we summarise the cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 infection and propose a simplified algorithm for patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has turned out to be a formidable pandemic. Upcoming evidence from confirmed cases of COVID-19 suggests an anticipated incursion of patients with neurological manifestations in the weeks to come. An expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 over the glial cells and neurons have made the brain a potential target. Neurotoxicity may occur as a result of direct, indirect and post-infectious complications. Attention to neurological deficits in COVID-19 is fundamental to ensure appropriate, timely, beneficial management of the affected patients. Most common neurological manifestations seen include dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizures. Anosmia and ageusia have recently been hinted as significant early symptoms in COVID-19. As cases with neurological deficits in COVID-19 emerge, the overall prognosis is yet unknown.",covid
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness. COVID-19 has now become a global public health crisis causing alarming numbers of morbidity and mortality. Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic started scientists, researchers, universities, companies, and institutions all around the world have been endeavoring to discover a potential treatment for COVID-19. Numerous studies and clinical trials on vaccines and drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 are underway across the world. However, the uncertainty around the efficacy and safety of various treatment regimens have become one of the biggest challenges in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2. This paper is a narrative review of articles regarding the various treatments and vaccines being tested for the SARS-CoV-2, available in the PubMed database along with Google Scholar. There are ongoing clinical trials on potential drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids tocilizumab, azithromycin, anakinra, etc. and other therapeutic modalities like convalescent plasma therapy. Likewise, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being developed and tested, including mRNA, non-replicating viral vector, DNA, protein subunit candidate vaccines, etc. Although some early-stage clinical trials and studies on these drugs and vaccines have shown positive results, definitive and conclusive results are yet to be obtained. Keywords: COVID-19; antiviral drugs; COVID-19 treatment; COVID-19 vaccine; SARS-CoV-2.",covid
"As of August 2020, thousands of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) publications have been produced. Manual assessment of their scope is an overwhelming task, and shortcuts through metadata analysis (e.g., keywords) assume that studies are properly tagged. However, machine learning approaches can rapidly survey the actual text of publication abstracts to identify research overlap between COVID-19 and other coronaviruses, research hotspots, and areas warranting exploration. We propose a fast, scalable, and reusable framework to parse novel disease literature. When applied to the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), dimensionality reduction suggests that COVID-19 studies to date are primarily clinical-, modeling- or field-based, in contrast to the vast quantity of laboratory-driven research for other (non-COVID-19) coronavirus diseases. Furthermore, topic modeling indicates that COVID-19 publications have focused on public health, outbreak reporting, clinical care, and testing for coronaviruses, as opposed to the more limited number focused on basic microbiology, including pathogenesis and transmission.",covid
"Background and objective: The Covid-19 pandemic especially affects cancer patients with higher incidence and mortality according to published series of original pandemic foci. The study aims to determine the mortality in our center due to covid-19 in cancer patients during the first 3 weeks of the epidemic. Material and methods: The cancer patients who died of covid-19 during the analysis period have been reviewed describing the oncological and the covid-19 infection characteristics and the treatments established. Results: Confirmed cases covid-19: 1069 with 132 deaths (12.3%). With cancer 36 patients (3.4%), 15 deceased (41.6%). Of the deceased, only 6 patients (40%) were in active treatment. The most frequent associated tumor was lung (8/15 patients, 53.3%), 11 with metastatic disease (11/15, 73.3%). No specific treatment was established in 40 % (6/15) of the patients. The rest of them received treatments with the active protocols. Conclusion: Covid-19 mortality in cancer patients is almost four times higher than that of the general population. Until we have effective treatments or an effective vaccine, the only possibility to protect our patients is to prevent the infection with the appropriate measures.",covid
"Objective: To assess the magnitude of COVID-19 spread and the associated risk factors among health care workers (HCWs), we conducted an in-hospital survey in a central Italian COVID Hospital. Methods: Participants underwent nasopharyngeal swab and/or serum collection for SARS-CoV-2 IgG examination. We divided participants according to working status, into rotating-night shift workers (r-NSW) and day-workers. Results: We found 30 cases of COVID-19 infection in a total of 1180 HCWs (2.5%). Most COVID-19-positive hospital employees were r-NSWs with significantly higher BMI than that of individuals who tested negative. After adjustment for covariates, night work and BMI > 30 were associated with a markedly greater risk of COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 3.049 [95%CI 1.260-7.380] and OR 7.15 [95%CI 2.91-17.51], respectively). Conclusions: Our results describe a low prevalence of COVID-19 infection among HCWs at a central Italian COVID Hospital. COVID-19 infection risk appears to be associated with obesity and night shift work, thus supporting the need for careful health surveillance among frontline HCWs exposed to COVID-19.",covid
"The socio-demographic factors have a substantial impact on the overall casualties caused by the Coronavirus (COVID-19). In this study, the global and local spatial association between the key socio-demographic variables and COVID-19 cases and deaths in the European regions were analyzed using the spatial regression models. A total of 31 European countries were selected for modelling and subsequent analysis. From the initial 28 socio-demographic variables, a total of 2 (for COVID-19 cases) and 3 (for COVID-19 deaths) key variables were filtered out for the regression modelling. The spatially explicit regression modelling and mapping were done using four spatial regression models such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), Spatial Error Model (SEM), Spatial Lag Model (SLM), and Ordinary Least Square (OLS). Additionally, Partial Least Square (PLS) and Principal Component Regression (PCR) was performed to estimate the overall explanatory power of the regression models. For the COVID cases, the local R2 values, which suggesting the influences of the selected socio-demographic variables on COVID cases and death, were found highest in Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Switzerland, Italy. The moderate local R2 was observed for Luxembourg, Poland, Denmark, Croatia, Belgium, Slovakia. The lowest local R2 value for COVID-19 cases was accounted for Ireland, Portugal, United Kingdom, Spain, Cyprus, Romania. Among the 2 variables, the highest local R2 was calculated for income (R2 = 0.71), followed by poverty (R2 = 0.45). For the COVID deaths, the highest association was found in Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria. The moderate association was documented for Hungary, Greece, Switzerland, Slovakia, and the lower association was found in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Netherlands, Cyprus. This suggests that the selected demographic and socio-economic components, including total population, poverty, income, are the key factors in regulating overall casualties of COVID-19 in the European region. In this study, the influence of the other controlling factors, such as environmental conditions, socio-ecological status, climatic extremity, etc. have not been considered. This could be the scope for future research.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an unprecedented disease caused by highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 and characterized by extreme respiratory deterrence, pneumonia and immune damage. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the sequence similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other SARS-like bat viruses. The primary source and intermediate host are not yet confirmed, although transmission from human to human is universally confirmed. The new SARS-CoV-2 virus reaches cells via ACE-2 and subsequently down-regulates ACE-2, leaving angiotensin II unbalanced in affected organs primarily in the lungs, heart, brain, and kidneys. As reported recently, numerous secondary complications i.e., neurological, nephrological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, and hepatic complications, are associated with COVID-19 infection along with prominent respiratory disease including pneumonia. Extensive research work on recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 is in the pipeline to clarify pathogenic mechanisms, epidemiological features, and identify new drug targets that will lead to the development of successful strategies for prevention and treatment. There are currently no appropriate scientifically approved vaccines/drugs for COVID-19. Nonetheless, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, azithromycin were tested against COVID-19 in clinical trials, and finally, FDA approved emergency use of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Additionally, administration of convalescent plasma obtained from recovered COVID-19 patients to infected COVID-19 patients reduces the viral burden via immunomodulation. This review analysis therefore concentrates primarily on recent discoveries related to COVID-19 pathogenesis along with a full description of the structure, genome, and secondary complication associated with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, a short and brief clinical update has been provided concerning the development of therapeutic medications and vaccines to counter COVID-19.",covid
"The corona virus-2019 (COVID-19) is ravaging the whole world. Scientists have been trying to acquire more knowledge on different aspects of COVID-19. This study attempts to determine the effects of COVID-19, on a large population, which has already been persistently exposed to various atmospheric pollutants in different parts of India. Atmospheric pollutants and COVID-19 data, obtained from online resources, were used in this study. This study has shown strong positive correlation between the concentration of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and both the absolute number of COVID-19 deaths (r = 0.79, p < 0.05) and case fatality rate (r = 0.74, p < 0.05) in India. Statistical analysis of the amount of annual fossil fuels consumption in transportation, and the annual average concentration of the atmospheric PM2.5, PM10, NO2, in the different states of India, suggest that one of the main sources of atmospheric NO2 is from fossil fuels combustion in transportation. It is suggested that homeless, poverty-stricken Indians, hawkers, roadside vendors, and many others who are regularly exposed to vehicular exhaust, may be at a higher risk in the COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and first emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Since then, the virus has rapidly spread to many countries. While the outbreak in China appears to be in decline, the disease has spread across the world, with a daily increase in the number of confirmed cases and infection-related deaths. Here, we highlight (i) the lessons that have been learnt so far and how they will benefit reducing the impact of COVID-19 disease and (ii) an update on the status of drug treatment and vaccine development to prevent COVID-19 and potential future related pandemics. Although the mortality rate is clearly higher than for influenza, the rate does seem to vary from country to country, possibly reflecting differences in how rapidly local health authorities respond to isolate and effectively care for the affected population. Drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients; however, no proven effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. A number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs, either alone or in combination, will prove effective. There is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available. This review summarizes the lessons learnt so far from the COVID-19 pandemic, examines the evidence regarding the drugs that are being tested for the treatment of COVID19, and describes the progress made in efforts to develop an effective vaccine.",covid
"This study attempts to document the nexus between weather, COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and the Chinese economy. We used daily average temperature (hourly data), daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, and RMB (Chinese currency) exchange rate to represent the weather, COVID-19 outbreak and the Chinese economy, respectively. The methodology of Wavelet Transform Coherence (WTC), Partial Wavelet Coherence (PWC) and Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC) is employed to analyze the daily data collected from 21st January 2020 to 31st March 2020. The results have revealed a significant coherence between the series at different time-frequency combinations. The overall results suggest the insignificance of an increase in temperature to contain or slow down the new COVID-19 infections. The RMB exchange rate and the COVID-19 showed an out phase coherence at specific time-frequency spots suggesting a negative but limited impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan on the Chinese export economy. Our results are contrary to many earlier studies which suggest a significant role of temperature in slowing down the COVID-19 spread. These results can have important policy implications for the containment of COVID-19 spread and macro-economic management with respect to changes in the weather.",covid
"A COVID-19 outbreak emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and developed into a global pandemic during March 2020. The effects of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China are unknown. Data on COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and daily mean temperatures were collected from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China between Jan. 20 and Feb. 29, 2020. Locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS), distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), and random-effects meta-analysis were used to examine the relationship between daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 and temperature conditions. The daily number of new cases peaked on Feb. 12, and then decreased. The daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 had a biphasic relationship with temperature (with a peak at 10 °C), and the daily incidence of COVID-19 decreased at values below and above these values. The overall epidemic intensity of COVID-19 reduced slightly following days with higher temperatures with a relative risk (RR) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). A random-effect meta-analysis including 28 provinces in mainland China, we confirmed the statistically significant association between temperature and RR during the study period (Coefficient = -0.0100, 95% CI: -0.0125, -0.0074). The DLNMs in Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan showed similar patterns of temperature. Additionally, a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model, with adjustment for climatic factors, was used to provide a complete characterization of the impact of climate on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.",covid
"Background: Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly infectious and requires early detection, isolation, and treatment. We tried to find some useful information by analyzing the covid-19 screening data, so as to provide help for clinical practice. Method: We collected nucleic acid and hematology data from 2510 patients for COVID-19 infection for retrospective analysis. Result: COVID-19 and influenza A and B infection rates were 1.3%, 3%, and 3%, respectively. COVID-19 nucleic acid was detected in stool but not in tear samples from 8 positive patients. Among the 32 patients with COVID-19, 15 (47%) and 16 (50%) patients showed decreased lymphocyte count and lymphocyte ratio, 21(66%) and 24(75%) patients showed decreased eosinophil count and eosinophil ratio, and 18 (56%) patients showed increased C-reactive protein. Ten hematological indicators significantly differed in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and those with influenza A and B (P < 0.05). Eighteen hematological indicators significantly differed between patients with COVID-19 and negative patients (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The positive rate of influenza A and B infection was higher than that of COVID-19. When pharyngeal swab collection may cause infection, fecal samples can be examined. Evaluation of pharyngeal swab and fecal samples can improve the positive rate of nucleic acid detection. The COVID-19 can cause some hematological indices changes.",covid
"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was firstly reported at the end of 2019. The disease rapidly spread all around the world in a few months and was declared a worldwide pandemic by WHO in March 2020. By April 9, there were 1,436,198 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world, nearly with 6% mortality rate. This novel infectious disease causes respiratory tract illness that may generally occur as mild upper respiratory tract disease or pneumonia. In older patients and/or patients with underlying conditions, it may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi organ failure and even death. According to the current literature, children account approximately for 1%–5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases. Generally, COVID-19 seems to be a less severe disease for children than adults. Approximately 90% of pediatric patients are diagnosed as asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease. However, up to 6.7% of cases may be severe. Severe illness is generally seen in patients smaller than 1 year of age and patients who have underlying disesases. The epidemiological and clinical patterns of COVID-19 and treatment approaches in pediatric patients still remain unclear although many pediatric reports are published. This review aims to summarize the current epidemics, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in pediatric patients.",covid
"Objective: To retrospectively compare the clinical features and chest computed tomography (CT) characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pneumonia in lymphoma patients. Materials and Methods: Ten lymphoma patients with pneumonia and 12 patients with COVID-19 infections were enrolled from January 15 to March 14, 2020. The clinical features were recorded. All pulmonary lesions on chest CT were assessed for location, shape, density and diffusion degree. Other typical CT features were also evaluated. Results: The most commonly observed patchy lesions were ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and mixed GGOs in both groups. Regarding the diffusion degree, 82% (92/112) of the lesions in the COVID-19 group were relatively limited, while 69% (52/75) of those in the lymphoma group were diffuse (p < 0.001). The proportions of interlobular septal thickening, vascular thickening, pleural involvement and fibrous stripes observed in the lymphoma cases were statistically compatible with those observed in the COVID-19 cases (p > 0.05). Air bronchograms were observed more frequently in COVID-19 patients (45%, 50/112) than in lymphoma patients with pneumonia (5%, 4/75) (p < 0.001). Halo sign (6%) and reversed halo sign (1%) were observed in several COVID-19 patients but not in lymphoma-associated pneumonia patients. Conclusion: Both lymphoma-associated pneumonia and COVID-19 generally manifested as patchy GGOs and mixed GGOs in more than one lobe. Compared to COVID-19, lymphoma-associated pneumonia tended to be relatively diffuse, with fewer air bronchograms, and no halo or reversed halo signs observed on chest CT.",covid
"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected orthopedic practices worldwide. Few studies focusing on epidemiology and management of fractures in COVID-19 patients have been published. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the fracture types, presentation, treatment, complications, and early outcomes of fractures occurring amidst COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A systematic review of the all published papers was conducted with a comprehensive search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane Library database using keywords 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus', 'trauma∗'and 'fracture' from January-April 2020. Results: The searches yielded a total of ten studies with 112 Patients who were positive for COVID-19 associated with fractures was performed for six studies, reporting data separately for 44 patients with COVID 19 and an associated fracture. A diagnosis of COVID 19 was made on the basis of positive Computed Tomography scan in 39 patients and 30 patients had a positive Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction test. Overall, there were 29 proximal femoral fractures, 8 spine fractures, 7 fractures of the other bones. The fractures were treated surgically in 30 cases (68.18%) and the remaining 14 cases (31.82%) were managed conservatively. There were 16 patients (36.36%) who died, mostly due to respiratory failure with a median age of 82 years. Conclusion: COVID-19 has led to a significant reduction in a load of fracture patients globally, though the incidence of fragility fractures continues to be unaffected. There is a significantly higher risk of mortality in elderly patients with fractures and hence they should only be operated in a facility with a robust intensive care. Conservative treatment should be adopted as far as possible in non-obligatory fractures and in lesser equipped centers. Surgery in patients with proximal femur fragility fractures when judiciously selected did result in improvement in respiratory status. Reorganizing medical services is vital to deliver effective fracture care and also mitigate disease transmission.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) first emerged in December 2019 in China and rapidly spread worldwide. While various studies have reported that COVID-19 is associated with a hypercoagulable state and thrombotic complications in critically ill patients, there are scant case reports on thrombotic events as one of the presenting symptoms.

"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global health crisis. This virus uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to facilitate cellular entry. ACE2 receptors appear to be highly expressed in pancreatic exocrine glands and islet cells, more so than in lung tissues, suggesting that pancreatic injury can occur despite having only mild COVID-19 symptoms. We report a patient with COVID-19 who presented with only gastrointestinal symptoms and discuss the importance of identifying pancreatitis early to improve prognosis.",covid
"COVID-19 is an emerging disease that is a major threat to the global community. The main challenge in this disease is the lack of proper or proven medication. The drugs used to treat this disease are only for symptomatic treatment. Studies of other coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, suggest that quercetin has sufficient potential to treat COVID-19. Previous studies have shown that quercetin reduces the entry of the virus into the cell by blocking the ACE2 receptor, as well as reducing the level of interleukin-6 in SARS and MERS patients. Therefore, the aim of this review was to scrutinize the potential of quercetin as a drug in the treatment of COVID-19 from a molecular perspective.",covid

"The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has found its roots from Wuhan (China). COVID-19 is caused by a novel corona virus SARS-CoV2, previously named as 2019-nCoV. COVID-19 has spread across the globe and declared as pandemic by World health organization (WHO) on 11th March, 2020. Currently, there is no standard drug or vaccine available for the treatment, so repurposing of existing drugs is the only solution. Novel drug delivery systems (NDDS) will be boon for the repurposing of drugs. The role of various NDDS in repurposing of existing drugs for treatment of various viral diseases and their relevance in COVID-19 has discussed in this paper. It focuses on the currently ongoing research in the implementation of NDDS in COVID-19. Moreover it describes the role of NDDS in vaccine development for COVID-19. This paper also emphasizes how NDDS will help to develop the improved delivery systems (dosage forms) of existing therapeutic agents and also explore the new insights to find out the void spaces for a potential targeted delivery. So in these tough times, NDDS and nanotechnology can be a safeguard to humanity.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic and antimicrobial resistance are parallel and interacting health emergencies with opportunity for mutual learning. As their measures and consequences are comparable, the COVID-19 pandemic helps to illustrate the potential long-term impact of AMR, which is less acute but not less crucial. They may also impact each other as there is a push to resort to existing antimicrobials in critically ill COVID-19 patients in the absence of specific treatments, while attempts to manage the spread of COVID-19 may also lead to a slow down AMR. Understanding how COVID-19 affects AMR trends and what we can expect if these remain the same or worsen, will help us plan next steps to tackle AMR. Researchers should now start collecting data to measure the impact of current COVID-19 policies and programs on AMR.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health emergency, in which its effective treatment and prevention remain obscured. Hyperpyrexia is an elevation of body temperature above 106.7°F (41.5°C) due to an abnormally increased hypothalamic-thermoregulatory set. The pathophysiology, impact, and outcomes of hyperpyrexia in patients with COVID-19 have not yet been studied. Herein, we present clinical features and outcomes of six patients with COVID-19 who had developed hyperpyrexia during hospitalization. All patients expired shortly after the onset of hyperpyrexia. Hyperpyrexia seems to adversely impact the outcomes and mortality in patients with COVID-19. The underlying mechanisms of developing hyperpyrexia in COVID-19 are mysterious. We propose it may be caused by SARS-CoV-2-related brain injury, exuberant immune response, and thrombus formation. More research is needed to verify our results. Understanding the association between hyperpyrexia and SARS-CoV-2 will help to elucidate the COVID-19 pathogenesis, which is mandatory for developing effective treatment strategies.",covid
"Background: COVID-19 poses many challenges to healthcare systems and workers. Responding to medical emergencies in patients with suspected COVID-19 will require new guidelines and protocols. Simulation can support their development. Methods: We organised seven simulations involving patients with suspected COVID-19 for staff at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals. Participants completed pre- and post-simulation questionnaires. Results: Fifty-six staff participated and they reported being significantly less prepared to respond to an emergency in a patient with suspected COVID-19 than in one in whom it is not suspected. The simulations significantly improved the participants' confidence in responding to emergencies in patients with suspected COVID-19. Numerous challenges were identified along the themes of equipment, personnel, communication and procedures. Conclusions: Low-fidelity simulation can provide relevant and timely information on how prepared health systems and their workforce are to respond to emergencies. We urge NHS trusts nationally to implement simulations to identify problems and develop effective solutions.",covid
"Background: The clinical features of COVID-19 pneumonia range from a mild illness to patients with a very severe illness with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring ventilation and Intensive Care Unit admission. Aims: To provide a brief overview of the existing evidence for such differences in host response and outcome, and generate hypotheses for divergent patterns and avenues for future research, by highlighting similarities and differences in histopathological appearance between COVID-19 and influenza as well as previous coronavirus outbreaks, and by discussing predisposition through genetics and underlying disease. Materials and method: We assessed the available early literature for histopathological patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia and underlying risk factors. Result: The histopathological spectrum of COVID-19 pneumonia includes variable patterns of epithelial damage, vascular complications, fibrosis and inflammation. Risk factors for a fatal disease include older age, respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity and hypertension. Discussion: While some risk factors and their potential role in COVID-19 pneumonia are increasingly recognized, little is known about the mechanisms behind episodes of sudden deterioration or the infrequent idiosyncratic clinical demise in otherwise healthy and young subjects. Conclusion: The answer to many of the remaining questions regarding COVID-19 pneumonia pathogenesis may in time be provided by genotyping as well careful clinical, serological, radiological and histopathological phenotyping.",covid
"The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has been characterized as a world pandemic by WHO since March 11, 2020. Although it is likely that COVID-19 transmission is primarily via droplets and close contact, airborne transmission and fecal-oral route remains a possibility. The medical staff working in the operating room, such as anesthesiologists, surgeons and nurses, are at high risk of exposure to virus due to closely contacting patients. The perioperative management is under great challenge while performing surgeries for patients suffering COVID-19, including emergency cesarean section, which is one of the most common surgeries under such circumstances. How to prevent medical staff from cross-infection is an issue of great concern. In this article, we give a practice of anesthesia scenario design for emergency cesarean section in a supposed standard patient suffering COVID-19, aimed to optimize the work flow and implement the protective details through simulation of a real operation scenario, which may be useful for training and clinical practice of anesthesia management for patients suffering COVID-19 or other fulminating infectious diseases.",covid

MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a retrospective study enrolling a total of 50 patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from February 27, 2020 to March 30, 2020, including a severe group (12 patients) and a mild group (38 patients). For the control group, 50 healthy people were examined during the same period. We compared clinical laboratory data and iron homeostasis biomarkers among the 3 groups. ROC curve analysis was used to assess diagnoses. RESULTS Patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 had higher hepcidin and serum ferritin levels than in other groups (p<0.001). A combination test of hepcidin and serum ferritin provided the best specificity and sensitivity in the prognosis of COVID-19 severity. Logistic regression analysis showed hepcidin and serum ferritin independently contributed to the severity of COVID-19. Hepcidin and serum ferritin tandem testing predicted COVID-19 severity with 94.6% specificity, while hepcidin and serum ferritin parallel testing had a sensitivity of 95.7%. CONCLUSIONS Iron homeostasis had a robust association with the occurrence of severe COVID-19. Iron homeostasis determinations were specific and sensitive for the early prediction of disease severity in COVID-19 patients and thus have clinical utility.",covid
"Background & aims: At-admission hyperglycemia have been associated with poorer outcome during critical illnesses. At-admission hyperglycemia in previously unknown diabetes is not uncommonly encountered entity in patients with COVID-19. We sought to find out the outcomes of at-admission hyperglycemia and effect of early intervention to achieve optimal glycemic control in relation to COVID-19 patients. Methods: We searched the PubMed and Google Scholar database up till August 20, 2020 using specific keywords related to our aims and objectives. Results: All currently available evidences clearly hint that at-admission hyperglycemia in patients with COVID-19 is associated with a poorer outcome, compared with normoglycemic individuals. Fortunately, early intervention by achieving an optimal glycemic control has also been associated with a significant improvement in the outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: At-admission hyperglycemia should be taken seriously by all clinicians treating patients with COVID-19. All efforts should be made towards an optimal glycemic control in patients with COVID-19, even in absence of pre-existing diabetes.",covid
"Following the easing of lockdown measures in many sub-Saharan African countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases have been on the rise. As the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, may be difficult to stop in these settings, we propose that the existing COVID-19 prevention strategies aimed at reducing overall transmission are complemented with more targeted strategies to protect people at risk of severe COVID-19 disease. We suggest investigating the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of distributing COVID-19 prevention kits to households with persons at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease.",covid
"Objective: To summarize for the trainee audience the possible mechanisms of headache in patients with COVID-19 as well as to outline the impact of the pandemic on patients with headache disorders and headache medicine in clinical practice. Background: COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, of which a large subset of patients features neurological symptoms, commonly headache. The virus is highly contagious and is, therefore, changing clinical practice by forcing limitations on in-person visits and procedural treatments, more quickly shifting toward the widespread adaptation of telemedicine services. Design/results: We review what is currently known about the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and how it relates to possible mechanisms of headache, including indirect, potential direct, and secondary causes. Alternative options for the treatment of patients with headache disorders and the use of telemedicine are also explored. Conclusions: Limited information exists regarding the mechanisms and timing of headache in patients with COVID-19, though causes relate to plausible direct viral invasion of the nervous system as well as the cytokine release syndrome. Though headache care in the COVID-19 era requires alterations, the improved preventive treatment options now available and evidence for feasibility and safety of telemedicine well positions clinicians to take care of such patients, especially in the COVID-19 epicenter of New York City.",covid
"Background Cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, partially owing to their compromised immune systems and curbed or cut cancer healthcare services caused by the pandemic. As a result, cancer caregivers may have to shoulder triple crises: the COVID-19 pandemic, pronounced healthcare needs from the patient, and elevated need for care from within. While technology-based health interventions have the potential to address unique challenges cancer caregivers face amid COVID-19, limited insights are available. Thus, to bridge this gap, we aim to identify technology-based interventions designed for cancer caregivers and report the characteristics and effects of these interventions concerning the distinctive challenges cancer caregivers face amid COVID-19. Additionally, this paper will present practical insights into the diverse intervention approaches that can assist in the delivery of digital health solutions for cancer caregivers amid and beyond COVID-19. Methods A systematic review of the literature will be conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus in September, 2020. Articles that center on technology-based interventions for cancer caregivers will be included in the review. The search strategy was developed in consultation with an academic librarian who is experienced in systematic review studies. Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles will be screened against eligibility criteria developed a priori . The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedures will be followed for the reporting process. Results NA-This is a protocol study. Conclusions COVID-19 has uprooted cancer care as we know it. Due to barriers introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as medical resources rationing, cancer caregivers often have to step up to address patients' healthcare needs and wants. This, in turn, will exert substantial stress on informal caregivers, above and beyond COVID-19-related burdens the general public shoulders on a daily basis. Findings of this study can shed light on evidence-based and practical solutions cancer caregivers can utilize to mitigate the unique challenges they face amid COVID-19. Furthermore, results of this study will also offer valuable insights for researchers who aim to develop interventions for cancer caregivers in the context of COVID-19. In addition, we also expect to be able to identify areas for improvement that need to be addressed in order for health experts to more adequately help cancer caregivers weather the storm of global health crises like COVID-19 and beyond.

"Aim: To determine the efficacy of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a marker of the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia in the South-Asian population. Methods: This was a prospective, cross-sectional, analytic study conducted at HDU/ICU of District Headquarter Hospital, Faisalabad, Pakistan, from May through July 2020. Sixty-three eligible patients, admitted to the HDU/ICU, were prospectively enrolled in the study. Their NLR, C-reactive protein, serum albumin, and serum fibrinogen were measured. Patients' demographic characteristics, comorbidities, clinical manifestations of COVID-19 infection, medication use, and history of lung malignancy were retrieved from their medical history. Patients were categorized into either a general group (with mild COVID-19) or a heavy group (with moderate to severe COVID-19). Results: There were significant differences between the two groups in diabetes prevalence, NLR, C-reactive protein, and serum albumin. NLR and C-reactive protein were positively correlated (P < 0.001, P = 0.04 respectively) whereas serum albumin was negatively correlated (P = 0.009) with severe COVID-19. NLR was found to be an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the heavy group (OR = 1.264, 95% CI: 1.046~1.526, P = 0.015). The calculated AUC using ROC for NLR was 0.831, with an optimal limit of 4.795, sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.75, which is highly suggestive of NLR being a marker for early detection of deteriorating severe COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: NLR can be used as an early warning signal for deteriorating severe COVID-19 infection and can provide an objective basis for early identification and management of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.",covid
"At present, COVID-19 is raging all over the world. Many comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.91-3.74) and hypertension (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.76-3.00), have been shown to worsen the patient's condition. However, whether cardio-cerebrovascular disease will affect COVID-19 remains unclear. In this meta-analysis, we collected studies from PubMed, Wed of Science and CNKI (Chinese) to July 25, which reported COVID-19 patients with and without cardio-cerebrovascular disease as well as their severity and mortality. The random-effect model meta-analysis was used to analyze them and get overall odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIs. Funnel plots and the Begg's and Egger's test were used to assess publication bias. Thirty-one studies with 23,632 patients were finally included in the meta-analysis. The results showed an OR of 3.004 (95% CI = 2.097-4.303) for COVID-19 severity and an OR of 5.587 (95% CI = 2.810-11.112) for COVID-19 mortality. Compared with cardiovascular disease, the subgroup analysis indicated that cerebrovascular disease was more likely to increase the severity (OR = 3.400, 95% CI = 1.569-7.368) and mortality (OR = 23.477, 95% CI = 3.050-180.735) of COVID-19. Therefore, it can be inferred that cardio-cerebrovascular disease is associated with an increase in the risk of severe illness and death among COVID-19 patients. This meta-analysis showed that cardio-cerebrovascular disease has a significant relation with severe and death outcomes of COVID-19. Nurses should pay special attention to COVID-19 patients with the cardio-cerebrovascular disease.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency that could potentially have a serious impact on public health. Fear has been one of the most frequent psychological reaction in the population during the current pandemic. The aim of this study was to compare fear of COVID-19 between genders and to examine whether the differences between genders may be predictors of fear of COVID-19 scores. A cross-sectional web-based survey design was adopted. The sample comprised 772 Cuban participants. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale was used to explore fear reactions in the sample. An independent-samples t test was conducted to compare the fear of COVID-19 scores between genders, and multinomial logistic regression was modeling to identify variables independently associated with fear of coronavirus. In our sample, on average, female participants experienced significantly greater fear of COVID-19 than men. The gender of participants significantly predicted the level of fear of COVID-19. Being female was a predictor of medium and high levels of fear of COVID-19. The odds of a female with middle fear levels compared to low fear was 3.13 times more than for a male, and the odds of a female with high fear levels compared to low fear was 3.45 times more than for a male. Our results corroborate international research that indicate a greater psychological vulnerability in women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This result points to the need to design interventions that reduce the negative impact of the current outbreak on women's mental health.",covid
"Objective: Despite huge global, national, and local preventive measures including travel restriction, social distancing, and quarantines, the outbreak of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) develops the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 emerging from Wuhan, China, took only three months to cover >200 countries worldwide by infecting more than 2.4 million people and killing more than 150,000 people. Although this infection at the early stage creates seasonal flu-like symptoms with a higher illness, it eventually causes a higher mortality. Epidemiological studies not only find the causes of many health issues but also suggest preventive measures. This study aimed to see the link between environment temperature and COVID-19 cases. Study design: The monthly average environment temperature (MAET) and various COVID-19 cases of a country were collected and analyzed to see the relationship between these parameters. Methods: Univariate analysis and statistical modeling were used to determine the relationship between environment temperature and different COVID-19 cases. Results: This study found that the majorities of the countries having higher COVID-19 cases are located in the higher latitude (colder region) in the globe. As of 20th April data available, statistical analyses by various methods have found that strong negative correlations with statistical significance exist between MAET and several COVID-19 cases including total cases, active cases, and cases per million of a country (Spearman correlation coefficients were -0.45, -0.42, and -0.50 for total cases, active cases, and cases/per million, respectively). Analysis by the statistical log-linear regression model further supports that the chance of patients to contract COVID-19 is less in warmer countries than in colder countries. Conclusion: This pilot study proposes that cold environment may be an additional risk factor for COVID-19 cases.",covid
"Objective: Evaluation of a diagnostic algorithm for estimating the risk of COVID-19 in patients who are referred to an emergency department for being suspected of having the disease. Design: Retrospective study. Method: Patients with fever with no apparent cause and patients with recently developed respiratory symptoms, whether or not in combination with fever, were routinely given a PCR test, blood tests (lymphocyte count and LDH levels) and a chest CT scan. The CT scan was assessed according to the CO-RADS classification. Based on the findings, the patients were divided into 3 cohorts (proven COVID-19, strong suspicion of COVID-19, and low suspicion of COVID-19) and the appropriate isolation measures were taken. Results: In the period from 8 to 31 March 2020, the algorithm was applied to 312 patients. COVID-19 was proven for 69 (22%) patients. COVID-19 was strongly suspected for 151 (48%) patients and suspicion was low for the remaining 92 (29%) patients. The percentage of patients with positive PCR results and the percentage of patients with abnormal laboratory test results increased as the CO-RADS score increased. Among patients with a CO-RADS score of 4 or 5, this percentage increased further when they also had lymphopenia or elevated LDH levels. We have adjusted the flowchart based on our findings. Conclusion: In case of patients who have been referred to an emergency department for suspected COVID-19, a good COVID-19 risk assessment can be made on the basis of clinical signs, laboratory abnormalities and low-dose CT scans. Even before the results of the PCR test are known and even if the results are negative, patients can be classified as 'proven COVID-19 patients' using the algorithm.",covid
"Objectives: Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which has spread in the world rapidly. Population have a susceptibility to COVID-19, older people were more susceptible to have a variety diseases than younger, including COVID-19 infection with no doubt. This study focused on older patients with COVID-19 infection and analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of them. Methods: We collected information on confirmed older patient transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service (EMS) to the designated hospitals from Jan 20 to Feb 29, 2020. The information including demographic, epidemiological, clinical, classification of severity and outcomes. All cases were categorized into three groups and compared the difference between aged 50-64 years, 65-79 years and older than 80 years. Results: 56.7 % of elderly confirmed patients were male, fever (78.3 %), cough (56.7 %), dyspnea (30.0 %), and fatigue (23.3 %) were common symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Classification of severity has statistically significant differences between the three groups, compared with middle-aged patients and aged 65-79 years group, older than 80 years group had significant statistical differences in contacted to symptomatic case in 14 days. As of Feb 29, 38.3 % patients had discharged and 53.3 % patients remained in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in elderly was 8.3 %. Conclusions: The COVID-19 infection is generally susceptible with a relatively high fatality rate in older patients, we should pay more attention to the elderly patients with COVID-19 infection.",covid
"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the outbreak of severe respiratory illness (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China and is now spreading rapidly throughout the world. The prompt outbreak of COVID-19 and its quick spread without any controllable measure defines the severity of the situation. In this crisis, a collective pool of knowledge about the advancement of clinical diagnostic and management for COVID-19 is a prerequisite. Here, we summarize all the available updates on the multidisciplinary approaches for the advancement of diagnosis and proposed therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Moreover, the review discusses different aspects of the COVID-19, including its epidemiology; incubation period; the general clinical features of patients; the clinical features of intensive care unit (ICU) patients; SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of co-morbid diseases and the clinical features of pediatric patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Advances in various diagnostic approaches, such as the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest radiography, and computed tomography (CT) imaging; and other modern diagnostic methods, for this infection have been highlighted. However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention. Lastly, potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described. Collectively, the review provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak along with the recent advancements and strategies for diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19.",covid
"COVID-19 is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that has an affinity for neural tissue. There are reports of encephalitis, encephalopathy, cranial neuropathy, Guillain-Barrè syndrome, and myositis/rhabdomyolysis in patients with COVID-19. In this review, we focused on the neuromuscular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed all published reports on SARS-CoV-2-related peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, muscle, and cranial nerve disorders. Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction is now accepted as an early manifestation of COVID-19 infection. Inflammation, edema, and axonal damage of olfactory bulb have been shown in autopsy of patients who died of COVID-19. Olfactory pathway is suggested as a portal of entry of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain. Similar to involvement of olfactory bulb, isolated oculomotor, trochlear and facial nerve has been described. Increasing reports Guillain-Barrè syndrome secondary to COVID-19 are being published. Unlike typical GBS, most of COVID-19-related GBS were elderly, had concomitant pneumonia or ARDS, more prevalent demyelinating neuropathy, and relatively poor outcome. Myalgia is described among the common symptoms of COVID-19 after fever, cough, and sore throat. Duration of myalgia may be related to the severity of COVID-19 disease. Few patients had muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase along with elevated levels of acute-phase reactants. All these patients with myositis/rhabdomyolysis had severe respiratory complications related to COVID-19. A handful of patients with myasthenia gravis showed exacerbation of their disease after acquiring COVID-19 disease. Most of these patients recovered with either intravenous immunoglobulins or steroids.",covid
"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a global public health issue threatening millions of lives worldwide. Although the infection is mild in most of the affected individuals, it may cause severe clinical manifestations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or cytokine storm leading to death. Children are affected less, and most experience a milder disease. As rheumatologists, we deal with the uncontrolled response of the immune system, and most of the drugs we use are either immune modulators or immunosuppressants. Thus, the rheumatologists participate in the multidisciplinary management of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, our patients with rheumatic diseases constitute a vulnerable group in this pandemic. In this review, a systematic literature search was conducted utilizing MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases, and 231 COVID-19 patients with rheumatic diseases have been identified. Only one of these patients was a child. Among these, 9 (3.9%) died due to COVID-19. In light of the current data, the aspects of COVID-19 resembling rheumatic diseases, the possible reasons for why children are affected less severely, the hypothetic role of available vaccines in preventing COVID-19, the unique position of patients with rheumatic diseases in this pandemic, and the use of anti-rheumatic drugs in COVID-19 treatment are discussed.",covid
"Background/aim: COVID-19 pandemic exposed physicians to extraordinary stress and made them vulnerable to various types of psychological illnesses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the psychological well-being of physicians. Materials and methods: We performed a cross-sectional, survey-based study, targeting physicians in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was to assess the psychological impact that the pandemic had on physicians by using a questionnaire that was previously designed and used by Reynold's et al. to survey Canadians during the SARS outbreak in 2003. The questionnaire assessed respondents' understanding of the rationale for quarantine, quarantine behaviors (including difficulties and compliance), as well as socio-economic and psychological impacts through answers that are based on a Likert scale. We also assessed the possible risk factors for psychological disorders related to the pandemic. Results: The study included 529 physicians from various regions in Saudi Arabia. The enrolled physicians were practicing different specialties and branches in medicine. We classified them based on their workplace in relation to COVID-19 exposure to: COVID-19 designated center vs. non-COVID-19 designated centers. Furthermore, we subdivided the physicians who work in COVID-19 designated centers to those who work in high-risk areas such as ER, ICU and COVID-19 isolation wards and other areas as low-risk areas. The most common feelings reported by the physicians during the pandemic were: worry (357, 67.5%), isolation (301, 56.9%) and fear (263, 49.7%). According to logistic regression analysis, physicians older than age 60 were less likely to feel isolated (OR = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.01-0.96, P = 0.05), female physicians were more likely to experience fear (OR = 2.96, 95% CI = 1.20 - 7.27, P = 0.02) and worry (OR = 2.87,95% CI = 1.23 - 6.69, P = 0.02), while physicians with a previous exposure to similar traumatic events were less likely to experience fear (OR = 0.24, 0.10 - 0.64, P = 0.004) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative psychological effect on physicians in Saudi Arabia. Gender, age, and previous exposure to similar traumatic events were predictive of psychological reactions to the pandemic in this population.",covid

"Introduction: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are among the most frequently identified comorbidities in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Patients with CV comorbidities are typically prescribed with long-term medications. We reviewed the management of co-medications prescribed for CVDs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Areas covered: There is no specific contraindication or caution related to COVID-19 on the use of antihypertensives unless patients develop severe hypotension from septic shock where all antihypertensives should be discontinued or severe hyperkalemia in which continuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors is not desired. The continuation of antiplatelet or statin is not desired when severe thrombocytopenia or severe transminitis develop, respectively. Patients with atrial fibrillation receiving oral anticoagulants, particularly those who are critically ill, should be considered for substitution to parenteral anticoagulants. Expert opinion: An individualized approach to medication management among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with concurrent CVDs would seem prudent with attention paid to changes in clinical conditions and medications intended for COVID-19. The decision to modify prescribed long-term CV medications should be entailed by close follow-up to check if a revision on the decision is needed, with resumption of any long-term CV medication before discharge if it is discontinued during hospitalization for COVID-19, to ensure continuity of care.",covid
"Background: As the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues, prognostic markers are now being identified. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are easily accessible values that have been known to correlate with inflammation and prognosis in several conditions. We used the available data to identify the association of NLR and PLR with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: A literature search using EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar for studies reporting the use of NLR and PLR in COVID-19 published until April 28, 2020, was performed. Random effects meta-analysis was done to estimate standard mean difference (SMD) of NLR and PLR values with 95% confidence interval (CI) between severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases. Results: A total of 20 studies with 3,508 patients were included. Nineteen studies reported NLR values, while five studies reported PLR values between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. Higher levels of NLR (SMD: 2.80, 95% CI: 2.12 - 3.48, P < 0.00001) and PLR (SMD: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.03 - 2.61, P < 0.00001)) were seen in patients with severe disease compared to non-severe disease. Conclusions: NLR and PLR can be used as independent prognostic markers of disease severity in COVID-19.",covid
"Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) originated in the Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in November 2019 and has since been declared a pandemic by the WHO. COVID-19 is an acute infectious disease, primarily affecting the respiratory system. Currently, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on respiratory specimens is considered the reference by which to diagnose COVID-19. However, the limitations of RT-PCR, specifically, the fact that it is time-consuming and inadequate for the assessment of disease severity, have affected the process of epidemiological disease containment and has taken a toll on the healthcare management chain. As the risk of infection for other patients and personnel must be kept to a minimum, the indications for imaging have to be carefully considered. Imaging is primarily performed in patients with a negative RT-PCR, but a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19, or, in patients with diagnosed COVID-19 who are suffering from moderate to severe symptoms. In this article, we review the typical imaging findings in COVID-19, the differential diagnoses, and common complications.",covid
"COVID-19 along with the mitigation strategies being used to address the virus pose significant threats to our individual and collective mental health. As the crisis evolves and persists, it will be increasingly important for the research community to conduct investigations that address the mental health consequences of COVID-19. The causes of mental health effects in the context of COVID-19 are multifactorial and likely include biological, behavioral, and environmental determinants. We argue that the COVID-19 crisis significantly threatens our basic human need for human connection, which might serve as a crucial environmental factor that could underlie the overall insult to our mental health. Furthermore, ""brain styles,"" which we have previously conceptualized as ""biotypes"" that are informed by a neural taxonomy, might interact with the universal threat to our need for human connection to explain the mental health consequences of COVID-19 from a precision psychiatry perspective. The goal of this viewpoint is to inspire research on the mental health consequences of COVID-19 from an individualized, brain-based perspective that honors the profound threat that the virus poses to our basic human motivations.",covid
"The number of COVID-19 patients is dramatically increasing worldwide. Treatment in intensive care units (ICU) has become a major challenge; therefore, early recognition of severe forms is absolutely essential for timely triaging of patients. While the clinical status, in particular peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels, and concurrent comorbidities of COVID-19 patients largely determine the need for their admittance to ICUs, several laboratory parameters may facilitate the assessment of disease severity. Clinicians should consider low lymphocyte count as well as the serum levels of CRP, D-dimers, ferritin, cardiac troponin and IL-6, which may be used in risk stratification to predict severe and fatal COVID-19 in hospitalised patients. It is more likely that the course of the disease will be unfavourable if some or all of these parameters are altered.",covid
"It was December 2019 that china reported series of patients with respiratory symptoms, a disease that later named COVID-19; and from there spread to other countries around the world; and in February 2020, the world health organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. From the beginning, it was assumed that COVID-19 occurrence in pediatric patients is less and has less severity but nowadays; there are a reports that shows severe cases with multiple organ involvement. The most manifestation symptom is fever but convulsion is rare as the first manifestation symptom. Here we describe a 3 years old; previously healthy boy that presented with repeated fever induced seizure and status epilepticus and positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 that in the first day; brain CT scan revealed brain edema and 5 days later, there was intracerebral hemorrhage in brain MRI.",covid
"The recent outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first in Eastern Asia and then essentially across the world has been declared a pandemic by the WHO. COVID-19 is caused by a novel virus SARS-CoV2 (2019-nCoV), against which there is currently no vaccine available; and current antiviral therapies have failed, causing a very high mortality rate. Drug repurposing i.e. utilizing an approved drug for different indication, offers a time- and cost-efficient alternative for making new therapies available to patients. Although there are several reports presenting novel approaches to treat COVID-19, still an attentive review of previous scientific literature is essential to overcome their failure to exhibit efficacy. There is an urgent need to provide a comprehensive outlook toward utilizing drug repurposing as a tool for discovery of new therapies against COVID-19. In this article, we aim to provide a to-the-point review of current literature regarding efficacy of repurposed drugs against COVID-19 and other respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses. We have briefly discussed COVID-19 epidemiology, and then have discussed drug repurposing approaches and examples, specific to respiratory viruses. Limitations of utilization of repurposed drug molecules such as dosage regimen and associated challenges such as localized delivery in respiratory tract have also been discussed in detail.",covid
"Introduction: The elderly population is the group most threatened by COVID-19, with the highest mortality rates. This study aims to analyse the case fatality of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients with degenerative dementia. Methods: We conducted a descriptive case-control study of a sample of patients diagnosed with primary neurodegenerative dementia. Results: Twenty-four of the 88 patients with COVID-19 included in the study died: 10/23 (43.4%) patients diagnosed with dementia and 14/65 (21.5%) controls; this difference was statistically significant. Discussion: Our results suggest that case fatality of COVID-19 is significantly higher among patients with primary degenerative dementia than in other patients with similar mean ages and comorbidities.",covid
"Impact statement: There could be a close relationship between periodontal diseases (PDs) severity and Covid-19 infections. This relationship could be caused by Galectin-3-mediated increased immune response and increased viral attachment. Keeping PDs under control and maintaining rigorous oral hygiene during this troubled Covid-19 pandemic period is very important. Patients with older age and pre-existing conditions like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are in the higher risk group for developing severe Covid-19 infections. The inflammatory pathways that are involved in these conditions are the same pathways that we see in periodontal diseases (PDs). This raises a significant question: Is PD a pre-existing condition that can increase the risk of developing severe Covid-19 infection? Several studies have shown that Galectins play a key role in the homeostasis of immune cells, and recently, a relationship was found between Covid-19 and Galectin-3 (Gal-3).It has been determined that an important area in the spike protein of Coronavirus-19 is almost exactly the same as the morphology of Gal-3, and these spike proteins are critical for the entry of the virus into host cells. We suspect that there is enough evidence to support a close relationship between PDs severity and Covid-19 infections. There is accumulating evidence to suggest a relationship between the severity of PD and the risk of infection with Covid-19, which requires further investigation. This relationship could be caused by Gal-3-mediated increased immune response and increased viral attachment. In this context, we want to emphasize the importance of keeping PD under control by maintaining rigorous oral hygiene during this troubled Covid-19 pandemic period. We would also like to point out the possibility that having PD may be a pre-disposition toward developing a severe Covid-19 infection.",covid
"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a paradigm shift in healthcare. Objective: To evaluate the utility of a strategy to comprehensively address the pandemic in a health area that covers 42,000 people. Method: Between March 10 and May 15, 2020, the COVID Unit was created in the corresponding regional hospital, and an independent circuit was established for the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19; social health centers were monitored with PCR testing. Results: Eighteen COVID-19-positive patients (age 72.9 ± 13.2 years) were admitted, out of which 66% were males. All these patients had pneumonia and 67% had respiratory distress syndrome; no one required mechanical ventilation. Mean hospital stay was 9.4 ± 5.3 days, and mortality, 11%. PCR tests were applied to all hospital residents (n = 827) and workers (n = 519), 1,044 phone calls were made and 36 hospital admissions were avoided. Only 50 patients required close follow-up, out of which four (0.48%) were positive for COVID-19. Conclusion: Clinical monitoring at the hospital and social health centers showed that patient profile was like that documented in the literature and that the incidence of COVID-19 was low in social health centers.",covid
"Objective: To compare National Health Service (NHS) organisations' testing pathways for patients with suspected COVID-19 in the community versus standard hospital testing practices. Perspective: NHS commissioners and services. Methods: During the containment phase of the COVID-19 pandemic we developed a community model pathway for COVID-19 testing in Wales with testing teams undertaking swabbing for COVID-19 in individuals' usual place of residence. We undertook a cost-minimisation analysis comparing the costs to the NHS in Wales of community testing for COVID-19 versus standard hospital testing practices and ambulance conveyancing. We analysed data from patients with suspected COVID-19 between January and February 2020 and applied assumptions of costs from national contractual and reference costs for ambulances, staffing and transportation with market costs at the time of publication. Results: 177 patients with suspected COVID-19 underwent community testing via local NHS organisations between January and February 2020 with a mean age of 46.1 (IQR 27.5-56.3). This was 92% of total patients who were tested for COVID-19 during this period. We estimate, compared with standard hospital testing practices, cash savings in improved productivity for the NHS of £24,539 during this time period, in addition to further non-monetised benefits for hospital and ambulance flow. Conclusions: Community testing for COVID-19 in Wales is now an established pathway and continues to bring benefits for patients, local healthcare organisations and the NHS. Further application of this model in other settings and to other infectious diseases may herald promising returns.",covid
"Introduction: Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure in Denmark, first-line referral centres were established to handle all patients suspected of COVID-19 or other upper respiratory tract infection. Here we report the first experiences from a first-line referral centre from Amager-Hvidovre Hospital, situated on the outskirts of Copenhagen. Methods: A retrospective quality assessment was performed with collection of symptom patterns and COVID-19 status. Results: During the first 24 days, a total of 3,551 patients were referred for assessment of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection and COVID-19. A total of 2,048 patients were assessed as having mild symptoms and referred for COVID-19 testing alone, whereas 337 patients were assessed clinically by a physician. Thirty-seven were positive for COVID-19 infection, 286 were negative. The most common symptoms reported were fever, coughing and dyspnoea. Fever was an independent predictor of COVID-19 infection (odds ratio (OR) = 2.25 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-5.04); p = 0.037); whereas sore throat was not (OR = 0.40 (95% CI: 0.15-0.92); p = 0.045). Only a small number of patients reported loss of taste or anosmia. In total, 113 patients were admitted to hospital, the majority of patients were discharged within 24 hours with mild symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. Three of the COVID-19-positive patients developed a severe infection and two had a fatal outcome. Conclusions: The present study is the first to report the experiences and symptom patterns of a COVID-19 first-line referral centre with efficient triage of patients in need of hospitalisation. Funding: none. Trial registration: not relevant.",covid
"Background: Saudi Arabia has taken unprecedented and stringent preventive and precautionary measures against COVID-19 to control its spread, safeguard citizens and ensure their well-being. Public adherence to preventive measures is influenced by their knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19. This study investigated the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the Saudi public, toward COVID-19, during the pandemic. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, using data collected via an online self-reported questionnaire, from 3,388 participants. To assess the differences in mean scores, and identify factors associated with knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward COVID-19, the data were run through univariate and multivariable regression analyses, respectively. Results: The majority of the study participants were knowledgeable about COVID-19. The mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 17.96 (SD = 2.24, range: 3-22), indicating a high level of knowledge. The mean score for attitude was 28.23 (SD = 2.76, range: 6-30), indicating optimistic attitudes. The mean score for practices was 4.34 (SD = 0.87, range: 0-5), indicating good practices. However, the results showed that men have less knowledge, less optimistic attitudes, and less good practice toward COVID-19, than women. We also found that older adults are likely to have better knowledge and practices, than younger people. Conclusions: Our finding suggests that targeted health education interventions should be directed to this particular vulnerable population, who may be at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. For example, COVID-19 knowledge may increase significantly if health education programs are specifically targeted at men.",covid
"We describe the early spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the first human-to-human transmission networks, in Romania. We profiled the first 147 cases referring to sex, age, place of residence, probable country of infection, return day to Romania, COVID-19 confirmation date and the probable modes of COVID-19 transmissions. Also, we analysed human-to-human transmission networks and explored their structural features and time dynamics. In Romania, local cycles of transmission were preceded by imported cases, predominantly from Italy. We observed an average of 4.8 days (s.d. = 4.0) between the arrival to a Romanian county and COVID-19 confirmation. Furthermore, among the first 147 COVID-19 patients, 88 were imported cases (64 carriers from Italy), 54 were domestic cases, while for five cases the source of infection was unknown. The early human-to-human transmission networks illustrated a limited geographical dispersion, the presence of super-spreaders and the risk of COVID-19 nosocomial infections. COVID-19 occurred in Romania through case importation from Italy. The largest share of the Romanian diaspora is concentrated especially in the northern parts of Italy, heavily affected by COVID-19. Human mobility (including migration) accounts for the COVID-19 transmission and it should be given consideration while tailoring prevention measures.",covid
"Background: COVID-19 mortality disproportionately affects the Black population in the United States (US). To explore this association a cohort study was undertaken. Methods: We assembled a cohort of 505,992 patients receiving ambulatory care at Bronx Montefiore Health System (BMHS) between 1/1/18 and 1/1/20 to evaluate the relative risk of hospitalization and death in two time-periods, the pre-COVID time-period (1/1/20-2/15/20) and COVID time-period (3/1/20-4/15/20). COVID testing, hospitalization and mortality were determined with the Black and Hispanic patient population compared separately to the White population using logistic modeling. Evaluation of the interaction of pre-COVID and COVID time periods and race, with respect to mortality was completed. Findings: A total of 9,286/505,992 (1.8%) patients were hospitalized during either or both pre-COVID or COVID periods. Compared to Whites the relative risk of hospitalization of Black patients did not increase in the COVID period (p for interaction=0.12). In the pre- COVID period, compared to Whites, the odds of death for Blacks and Hispanics adjusted for comorbidity was statistically equivalent. In the COVID period compared to Whites the adjusted odds of death for Blacks was 1.6 (95% CI 1.2-2.0, p = 0.001). There was a significant increase in Black mortality risk from pre-COVID to COVID periods (p for interaction=0.02). Adjustment for relevant clinical and social indices attenuated but did not fully explain the observed difference in Black mortality. Interpretation: The BMHS COVID experience demonstrates that Blacks do have a higher mortality with COVID incompletely explained by age, multiple reported comorbidities and available metrics of sociodemographic disparity.

"Aims: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients continue to require urgent surgery for hip fractures. However, the impact of COVID-19 on perioperative outcomes in these high-risk patients remains unknown. The objectives of this study were to establish the effects of COVID-19 on perioperative morbidity and mortality, and determine any risk factors for increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing hip fracture surgery. Methods: This multicentre cohort study included 340 COVID-19-negative patients versus 82 COVID-19-positive patients undergoing surgical treatment for hip fractures across nine NHS hospitals in Greater London, UK. Patients in both treatment groups were comparable for age, sex, body mass index, fracture configuration, and type of surgery performed. Predefined perioperative outcomes were recorded within a 30-day postoperative period. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identify risk factors associated with increased risk of mortality. Results: COVID-19-positive patients had increased postoperative mortality rates (30.5% (25/82) vs 10.3% (35/340) respectively, p < 0.001) compared to COVID-19-negative patients. Risk factors for increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery included positive smoking status (hazard ratio (HR) 15.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.55 to 52.2; p < 0.001) and greater than three comorbidities (HR 13.5 (95% CI 2.82 to 66.0, p < 0.001). COVID-19-positive patients had increased risk of postoperative complications (89.0% (73/82) vs 35.0% (119/340) respectively; p < 0.001), more critical care unit admissions (61.0% (50/82) vs 18.2% (62/340) respectively; p < 0.001), and increased length of hospital stay (mean 13.8 days (SD 4.6) vs 6.7 days (SD 2.5) respectively; p < 0.001), compared to COVID-19-negative patients. Conclusion: Hip fracture surgery in COVID-19-positive patients was associated with increased length of hospital stay, more admissions to the critical care unit, higher risk of perioperative complications, and increased mortality rates compared to COVID-19-negative patients. Risk factors for increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery included positive smoking status and multiple (greater than three) comorbidities.

"Introduction: Covid-19 infection poses a serious challenge for immune-compromised patients with inflammatory autoimmune systemic diseases. We investigated the clinical-epidemiological findings of 1641 autoimmune systemic disease Italian patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. Method: This observational multicenter study included 1641 unselected patients with autoimmune systemic diseases from three Italian geographical areas with different prevalence of Covid-19 [high in north (Emilia Romagna), medium in central (Tuscany), and low in south (Calabria)] by means of telephone 6-week survey. Covid-19 was classified as (1) definite diagnosis of Covid-19 disease: presence of symptomatic Covid-19 infection, confirmed by positive oral/nasopharyngeal swabs; (2) highly suspected Covid-19 disease: presence of highly suggestive symptoms, in absence of a swab test. Results: A significantly higher prevalence of patients with definite diagnosis of Covid-19 disease, or with highly suspected Covid-19 disease, or both the conditions together, was observed in the whole autoimmune systemic disease series, compared to ""Italian general population"" (p = .030, p = .001, p = .000, respectively); and for definite + highly suspected diagnosis of Covid-19 disease, in patients with autoimmune systemic diseases of the three regions (p = .000, for all comparisons with the respective regional general population). Moreover, significantly higher prevalence of definite + highly suspected diagnosis of Covid-19 disease was found either in patients with various ""connective tissue diseases"" compared to ""inflammatory arthritis group"" (p < .000), or in patients without ongoing conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs treatments (p = .011). Conclusions: The finding of a higher prevalence of Covid-19 in patients with autoimmune systemic diseases is particularly important, suggesting the need to develop valuable prevention/management strategies, and stimulates in-depth investigations to verify the possible interactions between Covid-19 infection and impaired immune-system of autoimmune systemic diseases. Key Points • Significantly higher prevalence of Covid-19 is observed in a large series of patients with autoimmune systemic diseases compared to the Italian general population, mainly due to patients' increased susceptibility to infections and favored by the high exposure to the virus at medical facilities before the restriction measures on individual movement. • The actual prevalence of Covid-19 in autoimmune systemic diseases may be underestimated, possibly due to the wide clinical overlapping between the two conditions, the generally mild Covid-19 disease manifestations, and the limited availability of virological testing. • Patients with ""connective tissue diseases"" show a significantly higher prevalence of Covid-19, possibly due to deeper immune-system impairment, with respect to ""inflammatory arthritis group"". • Covid-19 is more frequent in the subgroup of autoimmune systemic diseases patients without ongoing conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, mainly hydroxyl-chloroquine and methotrexate, which might play some protective role against the most harmful manifestations of Covid-19.",covid
"The consequences of COVID-19 infecting pregnant women and the potential risks of vertical transmission have become a major issue. Since little is currently known about COVID-19 in pregnancy, the understanding of COVID-19 in this particular group will be updated in time, and a comprehensive review will be useful to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Based on recently published literature and official documents, this review provides an introduction to the pathogenesis, pathology, and clinical features of COVID-19 and has focused on the current researches on clinical features, pregnancy outcomes and placental histopathological analysis from pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These viruses trigger a cytokine storm in the body, produce a series of immune responses, and cause changes in peripheral leukocytes and immune system cells leading to pregnancy complications that may be associated with viral infections. The expression of ACE2 receptors in the vascular endothelium may explain the histological changes of placentas from pregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2. Pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia show similar clinical characteristics compared with non-pregnant counterparts. Although there is no unequivocal evidence to support the fetal infection by intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 so far, more and more articles began to report maternal deaths due to COVID-19. In particular, from February 26, 2020 (date of the first COVID-19 case reported in Brazil) until June 18, 2020, Brazil reported 124 maternal deaths. Therefore, pregnant women and neonates require special attention regarding the prevention, diagnosis and management of COVID-19.",covid
"State and local health departments in the United States are using various indicators to identify differences in rates of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe COVID-19 outcomes, including hospitalizations and deaths. To inform mitigation efforts, on May 19, 2020, the Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) implemented a reporting system to monitor five indicators of state-level COVID-19 status to assess the ability to safely reopen: 1) composite syndromic surveillance data, 2) the number of new COVID-19 cases,* 3) the number of COVID-19-associated deaths,† 4) health care capacity data, and 5) public health capacity for contact tracing (contact tracing capacity). Using standardized methods, KDPH compiles an indicator monitoring report (IMR) to provide daily analysis of these five indicators, which are combined with publicly available data into a user-friendly composite status that KDPH and local policy makers use to assess state-level COVID-19 hazard status. During May 19-July 15, 2020, Kentucky reported 12,742 COVID-19 cases, and 299 COVID-19-related deaths (1). The mean composite state-level hazard status during May 19-July 15 was 2.5 (fair to moderate). IMR review led to county-level hotspot identification (identification of counties meeting criteria for temporal increases in number of cases and incidence) and facilitated collaboration among KDPH and local authorities on decisions regarding mitigation efforts. Kentucky's IMR might easily be adopted by state and local health departments in other jurisdictions to guide decision-making for COVID-19 mitigation, response, and reopening.",covid
"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that emerged from Wuhan city of China in late December 2019 continue to pose devastating public health and economic challenges across the world. Although the community-wide implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social distancing, quarantine of suspected COVID-19 cases, isolation of confirmed cases, use of face masks in public, contact tracing and testing, have been quite effective in curtailing and mitigating the burden of the pandemic, it is universally believed that the use of a vaccine may be necessary to effectively curtail and eliminating COVID-19 in human populations. This study is based on the use of a mathematical model for assessing the impact of a hypothetical imperfect anti-COVID-19 vaccine on the control of COVID-19 in the United States. An analytical expression for the minimum percentage of unvaccinated susceptible individuals needed to be vaccinated in order to achieve vaccine-induced community herd immunity is derived. The epidemiological consequence of the herd immunity threshold is that the disease can be effectively controlled or eliminated if the minimum herd immunity threshold is achieved in the community. Simulations of the model, using baseline parameter values obtained from fitting the model with COVID-19 mortality data for the U.S., show that, for an anti-COVID-19 vaccine with an assumed protective efficacy of 80%, at least 82% of the susceptible US population need to be vaccinated to achieve the herd immunity threshold. The prospect of COVID-19 elimination in the US, using the hypothetical vaccine, is greatly enhanced if the vaccination program is combined with other interventions, such as face mask usage and/or social distancing. Such combination of strategies significantly reduces the level of the vaccine-induced herd immunity threshold needed to eliminate the pandemic in the US. For instance, the herd immunity threshold decreases to 72% if half of the US population regularly wears face masks in public (the threshold decreases to 46% if everyone wears a face mask).",covid
"Background and objectives: Home care agencies (HCAs) provide caregivers, who perform an important role in maintaining the health and well-being of older adults. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, paid caregivers had the potential to inadvertently spread COVID-19. We sought to characterize the effects of COVID-19 on HCAs and examine HCAs' infection prevention and control (IPC) policies. Research design and methods: This was a qualitative analysis of data collected from a national survey of HCAs. Surveys were e-mailed to members of a national HCA association on March 18, 2020. Questions included queries on demographics, COVID-19 exposures, effects of COVID-19, and IPC protocols. Results: 1204 HCAs responded with an average census of 96.2 (5-2800) patients daily. Across 36 states, 238 HCAs reported COVID-19 cases or exposures among caregivers. HCAs experienced challenges related to changing patient needs (e.g. decreased caregiver requests), staffing shortages (e.g., fear of COVID-19, inability to train caregivers), and management issues (e.g., inability to obtain supplies). ICP protocols varied in how HCAs followed recommended guidelines, responded to COVID-19 exposures, performed infection surveillance, and implemented precautions. Additionally, HCAs had varying policies for caregiver PTO. Conclusions: HCAs experienced COVID-19 exposures and/or cases early in the pandemic. HCAs identified staffing and PPE shortages, and lack of IPC guidance as challenges. Although caregivers are providing essential care for millions of older adults, they have been largely absent from federal, state, and health system strategies for mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Future policies must include HCAs and their caregivers to optimize care for older adults.",covid
"Background: In December 2019, early cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan, China. By late January 2020, it was evident that COVID-19 was rapidly spreading and represented a national health emergency. In order to contain the spread of COVID-19, China adopted a centralized treatment plan by appointing designated hospitals in each region. Shantou Central Hospital is a Grade A Class A general hospital in Guangdong Province. It was appointed as a provincial COVID-19 designated treatment hospital on January 21, 2020, to provide all COVID-19-related treatments for the city of Shantou. The nursing department at Shantou Central Hospital is fully responsible for hospital nursing administration, nursing human resource management, nursing quality management, and all nursing tasks related to hospital medical care, nursing, teaching, scientific research, preventive healthcare, and so on. Objective: To summarize the role of nursing management in transforming a general hospital into a designated hospital for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Methods: We undertook a series of nursing management measures in the strategic phase and the implementation phase. Findings: Through a series of nursing management measures, all COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital were cured and discharged. All non-COVID-19 patients and staff hospitalized during the same period were not infected with the virus. During this period, our hospital completed 7,466 operations. Hence, our nursing management measures were effective. Conclusions: Our efficient nursing management system, first of all, effectively mobilized all available manpower; secondly, up-skilled and trained personnel within a very short period of time; thirdly, provided reliable logistical support for front-line protection equipments; and finally, motivated nurses during this very difficult time to make a significant positive contribution to the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has given rise to fear and panic in the public. Although hospitals in China reduced outpatient visits and restricted inpatient admission to lower the risk of transmission of COVID-19, this has significantly affected patients in need of medical attention, for example, patients with emotional disorders. Aims: This study aimed to compare the beliefs towards COVID-19 among outpatients with emotional disorders (ie, anxiety or depression) with those of family caregivers and the general public and examine factors that shape the beliefs towards COVID-19 among outpatients with emotional disorders. Methods: Survey data from 570 outpatients with anxiety or depression disorders, 449 family caregivers and 470 general public subjects were collected. Multiple stepwise regression analyses were used to describe participants' level of concern, prevention attitude and positive expectations towards the COVID-19 outbreak. Results: About 70.9% of outpatients had to postpone their mental health treatment; 43.2% of patients admitted that their mental health was adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak-these patients tended to be older, male and less educated. After controlling for age and education level, outpatients with emotional disorders had significantly lower levels of concerns but more negative expectations towards COVID-19, compared with family caregivers and the public. Multivariate linear stepwise regression analysis showed that age, education and the perception of the impact of COVID-19 on one's existing mental illness were significantly associated with outpatients' beliefs about the epidemic. Conclusion: Outpatients with anxiety or depression disorders were relatively less focused on the COVID-19 outbreak, but the impact of the infection was found to be independently associated with their beliefs towards COVID-19. In addition, outpatients who were older and of low educational levels particularly held more negative beliefs about the epidemic, which may place them at a higher risk for poor mental health.",covid
"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new variable of the Coronaviridae family. COVID-19 spreads primarily by contacting the virus either from a COVID-19-infected individual through coughing or sneezing or from COVID-19-contaminated surfaces. On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a pandemic. The government of Saudi Arabia was among the first countries in the world to take quick and serious precautions. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has made the public aware of the virus transmission patterns and the importance of quarantine and curfew. Despite strict measures taken, the awareness of people towards infectious viruses remains the most important factor in limiting the widespread of diseases. Method: A cross-sectional survey of 1767 participants, was conducted to explore the awareness, attitude and practice of COVID-19 in relation to socioeconomic data among residents in the city of Riyadh. Results: Of all the participants, 58% showed a moderate level of awareness, 95% presented a high attitude and 81% presented an adequate practice regarding COVID-19. Significant positive correlation between awareness-attitude (r = 0.132, p-value < 0.001) and attitude-practice (r = 0.149, p-value < 0.001) were found. The gender of the participants was the only common characteristic significantly associated with both awareness and practice. This study revealed that males showed a slight increase (60%) in the level of awareness compared to female participants (57%), however, when it comes to the practice towards COVID-19, females showed slightly better practice (82%) than males (80%). The World health organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) were the main sources of information. Conclusion: Despite the moderate public awareness, their attitude and practice were better. Therefore, public awareness must be improved to be prepared for epidemic and pandemic situations. A comprehensive public health education program is important to increase awareness and to reach sufficient knowledge.",covid
"Background: Trends in contact with a high volume national digital mental health service (DMHS), the MindSpot Clinic, provide a unique opportunity to assess the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Three methods were used to assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre traffic were compared across two time periods: the ""comparison period"" (1 to 28 September 2019), and during the early weeks of the ""COVID-19 pandemic"" (19 March to 15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all patients who started an assessment during the comparison (n = 1650) and the COVID-19 period (n = 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating therapists were examined. Results: There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 sample (76.9% vs. 72.9%), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the effect of social isolation. Conclusions: COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases in baseline symptom severity. With the prospect of prolonged restriction of movement, DMHS such as MindSpot could play an important role in both providing clinical services and monitoring the mental health of the population.",covid
"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to elucidate the chest imaging findings of suspected COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department and the relationship with their demographics and RT-PCR testing results. Methods: Patients presenting to the ED between March 12 and March 28, 2020, with symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 and subsequent CXR and/or CT exam were selected. Patients imaged for other reasons with findings suspicious for COVID-19 were also included. Demographics, laboratory test results, and history were extracted from the medical record. Descriptive statistics were used to explore the relationship between imaging and these factors. Results: A total of 227 patients from the emergency department were analyzed (224 CXRs and 25 CTs). Of the 192 patients with COVID-19 results, 173 (90.1%) had COVID-19 RT-PCR (+). Abnormal imaging (CXR, 85.7% and/or CT, 100%) was noted in 155 (89.6%) of COVID-19 RT-PCR (+) cases. The most common imaging findings were mixed airspace/interstitial opacities (39.8%) on CXR and peripheral GGOs on CT (92%). The most common demographic were African Americans (76.8%). Furthermore, 97.1% of African Americans were RT-PCR (+) compared to 65.8% of Caucasians. Conclusion: We found a similar spectrum of thoracic imaging findings in COVID-19 patients as previous studies. The most common demographic were African Americans (76.8%). Furthermore, 97.1% of African Americans were RT-PCR (+) compared to 65.8% of Caucasians. Both CT and CXR can accurately identify COVID-19 pneumonitis in 89.6% of RT-PCR (+) cases, 89.5% of false negatives, and 72.7% of cases with no RT-PCR result.",covid
"Objective: To assess the impact of the pandemic on surgical activity and the occurrence and features of Covid-19 in a Covid-free urologic unit in a regional hospital in Northern Italy. Materials and methods: Our Department is the only urologic service in the Trento Province, near Lombardy, the epicenter of Covid-19 in our Country. We reviewed the surgical and ward activities during the 4 weeks following the national lockdown (March 9 to April 5, 2020). The following outcomes were investigated: surgical load, rate of admissions and bed occupation, and the rate and characteristics of unrecognized Covid-positive patients. Data were compared with that of the same period of 2019 (March 11 to April 7). Results and conclusion: About 63%, 70%, 64%, and 71%, decline in surgery, endoscopy, bed occupation, and admission, respectively, occurred during the 4 weeks after the lockdown, as compared to 2019. Urgent procedures also declined by 32%. Three (8%) of 39 admissions regarded unrecognized Covid-19 overlapping or misinterpreted with urgent urologic conditions such as fever-associated urinary stones or hematuria. In spite of a significant reduction of activity, a non-negligible portion of admissions to our Covid-free unit regarded unrecognized Covid-19. In order to preserve its integrity, we propose an enhanced triage prior to the admission to a Covid-free unit including not only routine questions on fever and respiratory symptoms but also nonrespiratory symptoms, history of exposure, and a survey about the social and geographic origin of the patient.",covid
"Novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) originating from China has rapidly crossed borders, infecting people throughout the whole world. This phenomenon has led to a massive public reaction; the media has been reporting continuously across borders to keep all informed about the pandemic situation. All these things are creating a lot of concern for people leading to heightened levels of anxiety. Pandemics can lead to heightened levels of stress; Anxiety is a common response to any stressful situation. This study attempted to assess the knowledge, attitude, anxiety experience, and perceived mental healthcare need among adult Indian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire using a non-probability snowball sampling technique. A total of 662 responses were received. The responders had a moderate level of knowledge about the COVID-19 infection and adequate knowledge about its preventive aspects. The attitude towards COVID-19 showed peoples' willingness to follow government guidelines on quarantine and social distancing. The anxiety levels identified in the study were high. More than 80 % of the people were preoccupied with the thoughts of COVID-19 and 72 % reported the need to use gloves, and sanitizers. In this study, sleep difficulties, paranoia about acquiring COVID-19 infection and distress related social media were reported in 12.5 %, 37.8 %, and 36.4 % participants respectively. The perceived mental healthcare need was seen in more than 80 % of participants. There is a need to intensify the awareness and address the mental health issues of people during this COVID-19 pandemic.",covid
"To discover immune factors that can predict the progression of COVID-19, we evaluated circulating immune cells and plasma cytokines in COVID-19 patients. We found that T cells, including CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, were significantly decreased in severe COVID-19 symptoms but not in mild symptoms, in comparison with healthy people. T cells remained at a low level after recovery from severe COVID-19. CD4+CD25+CD127low Treg-enriched cells were significantly increased in either mild or severe COVID-19 patients, regardless of recovery or not. Moreover, in either mild or severe COVID-19 patients, Treg-enriched cells up-regulated CD25 and down-regulated CD127. After recovery, CD25 was partially down-regulated but still higher than the normal level, while CD127 returned to the normal level in mild patients but not severe patients. B cells were decreased in mild patients and further decreased in severe patients, and remained low after recovery. NK cells were decreased only in severe COVID-19, with a tendency to return to the normal level after recovery. Plasma IL-6 and IL-10 were both elevated in severe patients but not in mild patients. After recovery, IL-6 remained higher than its normal level, while IL-10 returned to the normal level. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that CD4+ T cells, B cells, IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity. Therefore, these parameters are indicators of COVID-19 severity. Dynamic monitoring of these parameters would benefit therapy planning and prognosis evaluation.",covid
"Objectives: Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic. The aim of the study is to investigate the demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics in suspected COVID-19 patients in our institution. Methods: In this retrospective study, we investigated suspected COVID-19 patients admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a request for IL-6 send-out test, from March 28 to June 27, 2020. Patients' demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected by chart review. Results: Fifty patients suspected with COVID-19 were included in our study, of whom 24 patients were positive with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and 26 were negative. During the observation period, 30 patients were discharged, 17 died during hospitalization, and three remained in hospital. Compared to non-COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 patients had an older age, more comorbidities, and elevated levels of inflammation markers such as ESR, CRP, serum ferritin and LDH. However, there was no significant difference in laboratory data between survivors and non-survivors in COVID-19 patients in our study. Conclusion: This study indicated that potential risk factors of older age, multiple comorbidities and high levels of ESR, CRP, serum ferritin and LDH could help clinician to identify potential COVID-19 patients. However, this data needs to be further validated in a larger population. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",covid
"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global health crisis since its first appearance in Wuhan, China. Current epidemiological studies suggest that COVID-19 affects older patients with multiple comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and chronic lung diseases. The differences in the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are likely to be multifaceted, depending on various biological, social, and economical factors. Specifically, the socioeconomic differences and psychological impact of COVID-19 affecting males and females are essential in pandemic mitigation and preparedness. Previous clinical studies have shown that females are less susceptible to acquire viral infections and reduced cytokine production. Female patients have a higher macrophage and neutrophil activity as well as antibody production and response. Furthermore, in-vivo studies of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) showed higher expression in the kidneys of male than female patients, which may explain the differences in susceptibility and progression of COVID-19 between male and female patients. However, it remains unknown whether the expression of ACE2 differs in the lungs of male or female patients. Disparities in healthcare access and socioeconomic status between ethnic groups may influence COVID-19 rates. Ethnic groups often have higher levels of medical comorbidities and lower socioeconomic status, which may increase their risk of contracting COVID-19 through weak cell-mediated immunity. In this article, we examine the current literature on the gender and racial differences among COVID-19 patients and further examine the possible biological mechanisms underlying these differences.",covid
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious zoonotic pathogen that has exacted heavy public health, social and economic tolls. In February 2020, the World Health Organization acronymed the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19, for coronavirus disease 2019. The number of confirmed COVID-19 infections, which has been detected in at least 103 countries, has reached 1,970,225 worldwide as of April 14, 2020 with 124,544 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Many cases of COVID-19 resolve quickly. However, the disease, which, like other respiratory pathogens that cause common cold symptoms is believed to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. Infection with COVID-19 can also lead to significant morbidity and death; this is particularly the case for cancer patients. Moreover, because the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are easily misattributed to the sequelae of cancer itself, such as pulmonary embolism, or its treatment, such as nausea and diarrhea, diagnosis may be delayed or missed. Potential COVID-19 rule out criteria, based on the Wells' criteria for pulmonary embolism, another protean disease entity, are provided as a decision-making aid. This review summarizes the current understanding of the transmission, clinical presentation, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, pathogenesis, rationale to treat the cancer or not, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 with an emphasis on implications in cancer.",covid
"The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and has created a medical emergency worldwide. In India, it is already reported more than 855 thousand cases and more than 22 thousands deaths due to COVID-19 till July 12, 2020. The role of temperature, humidity, and absolute humidity in the transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been well established. In contrast, for the previous many viral infections like influenza, it is well established. Therefore the study to investigate the meteorological condition for incidence and spread of COVID-19 infection and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease is required for India. In this work, we analyze daily averaged meteorological data for the last three years (2017-2019) for March, April and May months and the same for the year 2020 for March 1 to May 31. We found a positive association between daily COVID-19 cases and temperature and a mixed association with relative and absolute humidity over India. We have investigated the association of aerosols (AOD) and other pollutions (NO2) with COVID-19 cases during the study period and also during the lockdown period (25 March-31 May) in India. During the lockdown period, aerosols (AOD) and NO2 reduced sharply with a maximum percentage drop of about 60 and 45, respectively. We have also found the reduction in surface PM2.5 PM10 and NO2 for the six mega cities of India during the lockdown period. Our results suggest that COVID-19 still may spread in warm, humid regions or during summer/monsoon, therefore an effective public health intervention should be implemented across India to slow down the transmission of COVID-19.",covid
"Background: The rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis. Several factors influencing risk perception have been identified, including knowledge of the disease, information sources, and emotional states. Prior studies on COVID-19-related risk perception primarily focused on the general public, with little data available on COVID-19 patients. Purpose: To investigate COVID-19 patients' risk perception, knowledge of the disease, information sources, and emotional states in the epicenter, Wuhan, during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods: Data were collected online using self-administered electronic questionnaire developed with reference to previous relevant studies and publications by the World Health Organization. Findings: A higher level of perceived risk was found in relation to COVID-19 as compared to other potential health threats. Knowledge gaps existed regarding transmission and prevention of COVID-19. Additionally, risk perception was negatively related to knowledge and positively related to depressive states. Moreover, social media was a primary source for COVID-19 information, whereas the most trusted sources were health professionals. Discussion: Realistic perception of risk should be encouraged considering both physical and mental health while developing relevant strategies. Furthermore, risk communication needs to be specifically tailored for various target groups, such as the elderly and mentally vulnerable individuals, with the adoption of popular media platforms.",covid
"In this paper, we apply the risk-neutral valuation methodology to evaluate a life insurer's equity. We model the features capped by the explicit treatment of the borrowing firm's credit risk, the optimal guaranteed rate-setting, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. The results show that the severe effect of the COVID-19 epidemic on the borrowing firm harms its insurance business but that stringent capital regulation helps. The severe impact of COVID-19 on both the borrowing firm and the insurer hedging harm policyholder protection, thereby adversely affecting insurance stability.",covid

"This is a report of an atypical presentation of COVID-19. The patient had sparse pulmonary symptoms despite characteristic COVID-19 lesions on CT-thorax and developed severe acral ischaemic change, after a few days of hospitalisation. The condition could not be explained by classical sepsis with hypotension and hypoperfusion, disseminated intravascular coagulation, vasculitis, endocarditis or severe peripheral arteriosclerosis. A skin biopsy showed microthrombosis, interpreted as an activation of the coagulation system associated with COVID-19. Apparently, there are multiple COVID-19 phenotypes.",covid

The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are now seen in almost every sector of our society. In this article, I discuss the impacts of COVID-19 on the water sector. I point out that our efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 will increase the water demand and worsen the water quality, leading to additional challenges in water planning and management. In view of the impacts of COVID-19 and other global-scale phenomena influencing water resources (e.g., global climate change), I highlight the urgent need for interdisciplinary collaborations among researchers studying water and new strategies to address water issues.",covid
"Purpose of review: To highlight artificial intelligence applications in ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic that can be used to: describe ocular findings and changes correlated with COVID-19; extract information from scholarly articles on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 specific to ophthalmology; and implement efficient patient triage and telemedicine care. Recent findings: Ophthalmology has been leading in artificial intelligence and technology applications. With medical imaging analysis, pixel-annotated distinguishable features on COVID-19 patients may help with noninvasive diagnosis and severity outcome predictions. Using natural language processing (NLP) and data integration methods, topic modeling on more than 200 ophthalmology-related articles on COVID-19 can summarize ocular manifestations, viral transmission, treatment strategies, and patient care and practice management. Artificial intelligence for telemedicine applications can address the high demand, prioritize and triage patients, as well as improve at home-monitoring devices and secure data transfers. Summary: COVID-19 is significantly impacting the way we are delivering healthcare. Given the already successful implementation of artificial intelligence applications and telemedicine in ophthalmology, we expect that these systems will be embraced more as tools for research, education, and patient care.",covid
"COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease, which has human-to-human transmission through droplet and contact. It is commonly manifested as fever, dry cough, myalgia, and dyspnoea; the severity of this disease may range from mild, severe to a critical-illness. Currently, there is no definitive treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. The only proven form of management is isolation and supportive care. Therefore, nurses have a pivotal role to play in its management. This evidence-based comprehensive literature review provides the role of nurses in the management of patients with COVID-19, which starts from the initial assessment and triaging, sample collection, care of patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, care of the critically-ill patient, and care of the dead body.",covid
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious and has a variety of clinical manifestations, it can affect a number of other organs in addition to the lungs, and liver injury may occur. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can cause liver injury through systemic inflammatory response syndrome, cytokine storms, ischemia-reperfusion injury, side effects of treatment drugs, and underlying liver disease and can attack liver cells directly via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Clinical studies have found that liver injury in COVID-19 patients mainly manifests as abnormal liver biochemical indicators, but there have been no reports of liver failure caused by this disease. The number of COVID-19 patients with liver injury is increasing, and the incidence of liver injury in COVID-19 patients with severe disease are higher than in patients with mild disease. Liver injury may be a risk factor, which worsens in patients with COVID-19, and hence it is necessary to pay attention to the occurrence of liver injury in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.",covid
"The novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-Cov-2 or COVID-19 has become a worldwide threat and the major healthcare concern of the year 2020. Cancer research was directly affected by the emerging of this disease. According to some Chinese studies, cancer patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications. This observation led many oncologists to change their daily practice in cancer care, without solid evidence and recommendations. Moreover, the COVID-19 manifestations as well as its diagnosis are particular in this special population. In this review paper we expose the challenges of cancer management in the era of SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological, clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics of the disease in cancer patients and its outcomes on this population. Finally, we focus on strategies that are followed in cancer management with review of national and international guidelines.",covid
"Objective: The Covid-19 pandemic is a global challenge presenting clinicians with an evolving diagnostic landscape. We sought to describe EEG findings observed from local experience in a typical case series of patients with severe Covid-19. Methods: Ten cases of Covid-19 were identified in whom EEG recordings had been made during the course of admissions to Bristol hospitals which had required intensive care. Electro-clinical correlation between the EEG and available medical history, imaging and laboratory investigation results was explored. Results: The predominant EEG features in severe Covid-19 are of generalised symmetrical slowing, consistent with encephalopathy. Conclusions: The presence of focal disturbances or irritative abnormalities may be a pointer away from a pure encephalopathy and warrant further investigation. Significance: A growing range of neurological sequelae from Covid-19 are now recognised to be common amongst patients hospitalised by with this condition, being seen to affect approximately one third of such cases. Electroencephalography has a unique place in the diagnostic work-up of impaired consciousness, a frequent feature of severe Covid-19. However, there is currently a paucity of literature describing typical EEG findings in this setting.",covid
"Several recent studies have explored the association between environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and air pollution, and the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak by analyzing the statistical association at the district level. However, we argue that the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) arises when aggregating disease and environmental data into districts, leading to bias in such studies. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the association between environmental factors and the number of COVID-19 death cases under different aggregation strategies to illustrate the presence of MAUP. We used real-world COVID-19 outbreak data from the Hubei and Henan Provinces and studied their association with atmospheric NO2 levels. By fitting linear regression models with penalized splines on NO2, we found that the association between COVID-19 mortality and NO2 varies when data were aggregated (1) at the city level, (2) under two different aggregation strategies, and (3) at the provincial level, indicating the presence of MAUP. Therefore, this study reminds researchers of the presence of MAUP and the necessity to minimize this problem while exploring the environmental determinants of the COVID-19 outbreak.",covid
"Surgery in suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients is a high-risk venture. In infected patients, COVID-19 is present in the body cavity. During surgery it could be nebulized in the spray generated by surgical instruments and could theoretically infect members of the surgical team. Nevertheless, some surgical gynecologic pathologies cannot be postponed. We present a list of the most frequent gynecologic diseases and recommendations on their surgical management during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on expert opinion, current available information, and international scientific society recommendations to support the work of gynecologists worldwide. In brief, any kind of surgical treatment should be scrutinized and postponed if possible. Nonoperative conservative treatment including pharmacological therapies for hormone-sensitive pathologies should be implemented. Health risk assessment by patient history and COVID-19 test before elective surgery are pivotal to protect both patients and healthcare providers. In confirmed COVID-19 patients or highly suspected cases, elective surgery should be postponed until full recovery.",covid
"Background: The new COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on routine thoracic surgery. Various concepts and recommendations are being pursued to protect patients and hospital staff. However, the implementation of these recommendations may depend on the existing infrastructure, local conditions and in-house procedural instructions. Material and method: Between 11th May and 26th May 2020, an anonymous online survey on the topic of COVID-19 was conducted among thoracic surgeons in Germany. The survey consisted of 16 questions on the local COVID-19 case numbers, protective measures, procedural instructions and treatment concepts. The results were summarised, descriptively analysed and discussed. Results: The response rate of 42.6% (n = 66), included replies from 23 (34.8%) specialised hospitals, 18 (27.3%) maximum care hospitals and 14 (21.2%) university clinics. COVID-19-positive patients were treated in 65 (99%) clinics and 37.9% of the clinics also performed surgery on COVID-19-positive patients. Nasopharyngeal swabs were the main instrument for COVID-19 patient testing (in 95.4% of the clinics). Test results influenced decisions on treatment in 71.2% of the clinics. In 59.1% of clinics, safety equipment was supplemented with FFP2 masks and eye protection during thoracic surgeries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: Almost all thoracic surgeons reported that they had treated patients with COVID-19 and half of them also had performed surgery on COVID-19-positive patients. The applied procedural instructions as well as the effects of COVID-19 on treatment decisions and patient-doctor contact differed between the reporting clinics.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic and public health ""lockdown"" responses in sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda, are now widely reported. Although the impact of COVID-19 on African populations has been relatively light, it is feared that redirecting focus and prioritization of health systems to fight COVID-19 may have an impact on access to non-COVID-19 diseases. We applied age-based COVID-19 mortality data from China to the population structures of Uganda and non-African countries with previously established outbreaks, comparing theoretical mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost. We then predicted the impact of possible scenarios of the COVID-19 public health response on morbidity and mortality for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and maternal health in Uganda. Based on population age structure alone, Uganda is predicted to have a relatively low COVID-19 burden compared with an equivalent transmission in comparison countries, with 12% of the mortality and 19% of the lost DALYs predicted for an equivalent transmission in Italy. By contrast, scenarios of the impact of the public health response on malaria and HIV/AIDS predict additional disease burdens outweighing that predicted from extensive SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Emerging disease data from Uganda suggest that such deterioration may already be occurring. The results predict a relatively low COVID-19 impact on Uganda associated with its young population, with a high risk of negative impact on non-COVID-19 disease burden from a prolonged lockdown response. This may reverse hard-won gains in addressing fundamental vulnerabilities in women and children's health, and underlines the importance of tailoring COVID-19 responses according to population structure and local disease vulnerabilities.",covid
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by a coronavirus that is transmitted primarily via aerosol, droplets or direct contact. This may place anesthetists at higher risk of infection due to their frequent involvement in aerosol-generating airway interventions. Many anesthethetic COVID-19 guidelines have emerged, whose underlying management principles include minimizing aerosol contamination and protecting healthcare workers. These guidelines originate from Australia and New Zealand, Canada, China, India, Italy, Korea, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients may require airway interventions, and difficult tracheal intubation secondary to laryngeal edema has been reported. Pre-pandemic difficult airway guidelines include those from Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Scandinavia, the United States and the United Kingdom. These difficult airway guidelines require modifications in order to align with the principles of the anesthetic COVID-19 guidelines. In turn, most of the anesthetic COVID-19 guidelines do not, or only briefly, discuss an airway strategy after failed tracheal intubation. Our article identifies and compares pre-pandemic difficult airway guidelines with the recent anesthetic COVID-19 guidelines. We combine the principles from both sets of guidelines and explain the necessary modifications to the airway guidelines, to form a failed tracheal intubation airway strategy in the COVID-19 patient. Valuing, and a greater understanding of, these differences and modifications may lead to greater adherence to the new COVID-19 guidelines.",covid
"Background: The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is already wreaking havoc on families and communities' welfare. It is critical to discuss newborn care of infected mothers with COVID-19 based on the latest international guidelines and national guidelines of countries with the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases.Objective: We discuss how to care for a newborn of a suspected or infected mother with COVID-19 using existing evidence.Method: As of 16 April 2020, we reviewed articles and guidelines related to COVID-19 in the reproductive health field, mother, and newborn health. Our review yielded in 10 categories (i) the risk of diagnostic procedures in suspected mothers on fetus/infant health, (ii) the risk of intrauterine or postpartum transmission to the fetus/infant, (iii) appropriate method and delivery time in women with confirmed COVID-19, (iv) umbilical cord clamping and skin to skin contact, (v) clinical manifestations of infected infants, (vi) confirmation of infection in a suspected neonate/infant, (vii) instructions for infant's care and how to feed her/him, (viii) bathing the baby, (ix) the criteria of discharging baby from the hospital, (x) the impact of isolation on the maternal mental health.Results: Our findings showed that the possibility of intrauterine or perinatal transmission of COVID-19 is still questionable and ambiguous. However, what has been agreed upon in the existing texts and guidelines is that the close contact of mother and infant after birth can transmit the virus to the baby through droplets or micro-droplets.Conclusions: Based on our findings, it is recommended to separate the baby from the mother with confirmed (or suspected) COVID-19 infection for at least 2 weeks. Since the motivation and stable situation of mothers allow breastfeeding during the isolation, infected mothers should be taught about breast expression skills, common breast problems, the symptoms of their baby's infection, and the principles of personal hygiene to protect the infant against COVID-19 infection.",covid
"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the newly identified strain of the coronavirus family that has been shown to affect the hemoglobin beta chain, the same chain that has the sickle cell disease mutation. This study was undertaken to see if COVID-19 infection increased disease severity in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) METHODS: Mass screening of the Bahraini population was undertaken between February and April 2020. Results: 38,092 Bahraini people were tested during this period for COVID-19, of whom 378 (1%) were SCD patients. Six patients with SCD had COVID-19 (1.6%); three remained asymptomatic, two had mild symptoms and only one required oxygen therapy. The SCD patients had a similar average length of stay when compared to non-sickle cell disease COVID-19 patients (10.7 days). Conclusion: The infection rate, clinical course and viral clearance seen for the SCD patients with COVID19 was not different than those without SCD.",covid
"Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is a severe complication of inflammatory immune diseases or treatment of malignancies; it may also appear during the progression of COVID-19. CSS is caused by dysregulation of the synthesis of cytokines, including pro-inflammatory, regulatory, and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to pathologic activation of innate and adaptive (Th1 and Th17 mediated) immunity. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CSS. The significant role of IL-6 in pathogenesis of COVID-19 was confirmed in a range of studies, which showed that the plasma concentration of IL-6 was increased in patients with severe COVID-19. Currently, IL-6 inhibitor therapeutics are not yet approved for the treatment of COVID-19; however, these medicines, including tocilizumab (TCZ) are used off-label for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, including life-threatening conditions. The role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of CSS during COVID-19 is important however, a number of related issues are not yet clear. These issues include the indications for treatment with IL-6 inhibitors, as well as the estimation of risk associated with the disease, outcomes, treatment options, and adverse drug reactions. The development of personalized immunomodulatory therapy, with respect to the role of cytokines in pathogenesis, requires the studies that aimed to find other relevant therapeutic targets for the treatment of CSS in patients with COVID-19. These therapeutic targets include inhibition of IL-1, IL-6, TNFα, GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-17, IL-18, and also activation of the complement system. The challenge of CSS in patients with COVID-19 is identifying the correct scientific targets and developing clinical trials aimed to evaluate the pathogenesis and treat immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). Hopefully, the significant efforts of scientists and physicians across the globe will improve the prognosis in COVID-19 patients and provide useful information on IMIDs required to support the struggle for treating potential viral outbreaks, and treatment of well-known IMIDs.",covid
"Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has many consequences for people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Social distancing measures complicate regular care and result in lifestyle changes, which may indirectly cause psychological stress and worsening of PD symptoms. Objective: To assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased psychological distress and decreased physical activity in PD, how these changes related to PD motor and non-motor symptom severity, and what frequency and burden of COVID-related stressors were. Methods: We sent an online survey to the Personalized Parkinson Project (PPP) cohort (n = 498 PD patients) in the Netherlands. In the survey, we distinguished between COVID-related stressor load, psychological distress, PD symptom severity, and physical activity. We related inter-individual differences to personality factors and clinical factors collected before the pandemic occurred. Results: 358 PD patients completed the survey between April 21 and May 25, 2020 (response rate 71.9%). Patients with higher COVID-related stressor load experienced more PD symptoms, and this effect was mediated by the degree of psychological distress. 46.6% of PD patients were less physically active since the COVID-19 pandemic, and reduced physical activity correlated with worse PD symptoms. Symptoms that worsened most were rigidity, fatigue, tremor, pain and concentration. Presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression) before the pandemic, as well as cognitive dysfunction and several personality traits predicted increased psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Our findings show how an external stressor (the COVID-19 pandemic) leads to a worsening of PD symptoms by evoking psychological distress as well as lifestyle changes (reduced physical activity).",covid
"With the spiraling pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has becoming inherently important to disseminate accurate and timely information about the disease. Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing-based risk alert systems to spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer the state of the COVID-19 propagation. CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas by inferring future propagation patterns. The CovidSens concept is motivated by three observations: (1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media, (2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social media, and (3) online users are frequently equipped with substantially capable mobile devices that are able to perform non-trivial on-device computation for data processing and analytics. We envision an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the ordinary people to build a real-time sensing and analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to distill reliable information about the COVID-19 with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively, and alert them to remain prepared? How to leverage the computational power on the edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, UAVs) to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms for rapid detection of the COVID-19 spread? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in developing reliable social sensing-based risk alert systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines (e.g., AI, estimation theory, machine learning, constrained optimization) can be effective in addressing the challenges. Finally, we outline a few research directions for future work in CovidSens.",covid
"To investigate the value of the combined detection of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein level (CRP) in the diagnosis of COVID-19. A total of 191 patients with COVID-19 were recruited at the Third Hospital of Wuhan from 21 January 2020 to 20 February 2020. Fifty healthy volunteers were randomly selected as the control group. Age, gender, white blood cell count (WBC), CRP, lymphocyte percentage, and NLR were extracted. Quantitative clinical characteristics and laboratory values were compared between groups. Risk factors and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for COVID-19 were analyzed. We found that the NLR and CRP were higher, while the lymphocyte percentage was lower in patients with COVID-19 than in healthy controls. Among patients confirmed to have COVID-19, the NLR and CRP of the moderate group were lower than those of severely ill patients (severe, critical and death groups), and the lymphocyte percentage of the moderate group was higher than that of the critical and death group. There were no significant differences in WBC among all groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that the NLR, CRP, and lymphocyte percentage were independent risk factors for COVID-19. The AUC of the combined determination of NLR and CRP was 0.863, which was higher than that of NLR, CRP, WBC, and lymphocyte percentage (AUC: 0.835, 0.775, 0.416, and 0.749, respectively). Our results showed that the NLR and CRP were independent risk factors for COVID-19, and the combined detection of the NLR and CRP showed improved diagnostic performance for COVID-19.",covid
"The COVID-19 pandemic has not only had a negative impact on people's health and life behavior, but also on economies around the world. At the same time, laboratories and institutions are working hard to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, which we hope will be available soon. However, there has been no assessment of whether an individual and society value ​​a vaccine monetarily, and what factors determine this value. Therefore, the objective of this research was to estimate the individual's willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and, at the same time, find the main factors that determine this valuation. For this, we used the contingent valuation approach, in its single and double-bounded dichotomous choice format, which was based on a hypothetical market for a vaccine. The sample used was obtained through an online survey of n = 566 individuals from Chile. The main results showed that the WTP depends on the preexistence of chronic disease (p≤0.05), knowledge of COVID-19 (p≤0.05), being sick with COVID-19 (p≤0.05), perception of government performance (p≤0.01), employment status (p≤0.01), income (p≤0.01), health care (p≤0.05), adaptation to quarantine with children at home (p≤0.01) and whether the person has recovered from COVID-19 (p≤0.10). According to our discrete choice model in double-bounded dichotomous format, it was concluded that the individuals' WTP is US$184.72 (CI: 165.52-203.92; p < 0.01). This implies a social valuation of approximately US$2232 million, corresponding to 1.09% of the GNP per capita.",covid
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been worldwide, and clinicians and researchers around the world have been working to develop effective and efficient methods for early detection as well as monitoring of the disease progression. This minireview compiles the various agency and expert recommendations, along with results from studies published in numerous countries, in an effort to facilitate the research in imaging technology development to benefit the detection and monitoring of COVID-19.

"Background: Previous studies on the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) have found strong correlations between online searches and the epidemiology of the disease. Aim: Our aim was to determine if online searches for COVID-19 related to international media announcements or national epidemiology. Methods: Searches for ""coronavirus"" were made on Google Trends from December 31, 2019 to April 13, 2020 for 40 European countries. The online COVID-19 searches for all countries were correlated with each other. COVID-10 epidemiology (i.e. incidence and mortality) was correlated with the national online searches. Major announcements by the World Health Organization (WHO) were taken into consideration with peaks in online searches. Correlations were made using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results: Overall, the online searches for COVID-19 were not correlated with the actual incidence and mortality of COVID-19. The mean Spearman correlation for incidence was 0.20 (range -0.66 to 0.76) and for mortality was 0.35 (range -0.75 to 0.85). Online searches in Europe were all strongly synchronized with each other; a mean Spearman correlation of 0.93 (range 0.62 to 0.99). Conclusions: Online searches for COVID-19 in Europe are not correlated with epidemiology but strongly correlated with international WHO announcements. Our study challenges previous Google Trends studies and emphasizes the role of the WHO in raising awareness of a new disease.",covid
"Meningitis is defined as inflammation of the meninges, in almost all cases identified by an abnormal number of white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid and specific clinical signs/symptoms. Onset may be acute or chronic, and clinical symptoms of acute disease develop over hours to days. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of acute meningitis, and provides a list of key points for primary care practitioners. Aseptic and bacterial meningitis vary significantly and are discussed separately.",meningitis
"Chronic meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges with subacute onset and persisting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities lasting for at least one month. Several non-infectious and infectious etiologies are known to be causative. The wide range of different etiologies renders the approach to patients with this syndrome particularly difficult. There is no standardized diagnostic procedure, thus, taking an in depth history combined with a complete physical examination is mandatory in every patient.This review aims to present the current knowledge on etiology, neurological course of disease, diagnostic and therapeutic management steps of patients presenting with clinical signs and symptoms of chronic meningitis and meningoencephalitis. Still, the etiology of one third of patients remains unclear, reflecting the diagnostic challenge of this syndrome for each physician or neurologist, respectively. However, most patients with idiopathic chronic meningitis have a relatively good outcome.",meningitis
"In the past 10 years the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis has changed, with a decreased incidence of meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae and an increasing incidence of meningitis caused by penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Meningococcal meningitis has become an increasing threat to college students. Successful outcome from meningitis requires not only eradication of the bacterial pathogen but also management of the neurological complications of raised intracranial pressure, stroke, and seizure activity. In this article, the pathophysiology, etiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and management of acute bacterial meningitis are reviewed. The present recommendations for the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of this infection, the use of chemoprophylaxis, and the indications for vaccinations are included.",meningitis
"The central nervous system (CNS) is an immunologically specialized tissue protected by a blood-brain barrier. The CNS parenchyma is enveloped by a series of overlapping membranes that are collectively referred to as the meninges. The meninges provide an additional CNS barrier, harbor a diverse array of resident immune cells, and serve as a crucial interface with the periphery. Recent studies have significantly advanced our understanding of meningeal immunity, demonstrating how a complex immune landscape influences CNS functions under steady-state and inflammatory conditions. The location and activation state of meningeal immune cells can profoundly influence CNS homeostasis and contribute to neurological disorders, but these cells are also well equipped to protect the CNS from pathogens. In this review, we discuss advances in our understanding of the meningeal immune repertoire and provide insights into how this CNS barrier operates immunologically under conditions ranging from neurocognition to inflammatory diseases.",meningitis
"A thorough neurological examination in emergency situations requires the evaluation of meningeal signs. Even though in most settings, evaluation of meningism is technically not very demanding, the interpretation of findings may prove difficult. As opposed to a widely held belief, clinical signs of meningism are neither specific nor highly sensitive for detection of meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage. A meaningful evaluation of meningeal signs, therefore, requires careful consideration of both clinical findings and other accessory symptoms.",meningitis
"Neoplastic meningitis (NM) is a common problem in neuro-oncology, occurring in approximately 5% of all patients with cancer. Notwithstanding frequent focal signs and symptoms, NM is a disease that affects the entire neuraxis; therefore, staging and treatment need to encompass all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments. Central nervous system (CNS) staging of NM includes contrast-enhanced cranial computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, contrast-enhanced spine magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomographic myelography, and radionuclide CSF flow study. Treatment of NM involves involved-field radiotherapy of bulky or symptomatic disease sites and intra-CSF drug therapy. The inclusion of concomitant systemic therapy may benefit patients with NM and may obviate the need for intra-CSF chemotherapy. At present, intra-CSF drug therapy is confined to three chemotherapeutic agents (ie, methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside, and thio-triethylene thiophosphoramide) administered by a variety of schedules either by intralumbar or intraventricular drug delivery. Although treatment of NM is palliative with an expected median patient survival of 2 to 6 months, it often affords stabilization and protection from further neurologic deterioration in patients with NM.",meningitis
"The paper presents the past knowledge of the etiology of chronic meningeal syndrome. The causes are divided into those of infective and those of noninfective etiology. Basic recommendations for general diagnostic approach, laboratory, clinical and radiological follow up of the patients have been given. A wide spectrum of differential-diagnostic possibilities has been pointed out, especially in relation to chronic systemic diseases. Characteristic syndromes of chronic meningitis have been separated and concisely described.",meningitis
"Multidrug-resistant tuberculous meningitis is now appearing worldwide, including in the United States, and is difficult to diagnose and treat. We discuss methods to diagnose tuberculous meningitis, review current and experimental assays for determining drug resistance, and consider approaches to management of the patient. We review the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis in both pulmonary and meningeal infections, discuss promising molecular methods for determining drug resistance, and review current approaches toward treatment of patients. The incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculous meningitis is increasing, and diagnosing and treating these patients will be a major challenge. There is a need to improve rapid methods of isolating the organism from cerebrospinal fluid, to advance molecular methods to rapidly test the isolate for antibiotic sensitivity, and to develop new antituberculosis drugs, especially ones that cross the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.",meningitis
"Lymphomatous meningitis (LM) due to primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma is an uncommon problem in neurooncology and can occur at time of diagnosis or recurrence. Notwithstanding frequent focal signs and symptoms, LM is a disease affecting the entire neuraxis, and therefore staging and treatment need to encompass all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments. Central nervous system staging of LM includes contrast agent-enhanced cranial computed tomography (CT) or Gd-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, Gd-enhanced spinal MR imaging, CT myelography, and radionuclide CSF flow study. Treatment of LM includes involved-field radiotherapy of bulky or symptomatic disease sites and intra-CSF drug therapy. The inclusion of concomitant systemic therapy can benefit patients with LM and can obviate the need for intra-CSF chemotherapy. At present, intra-CSF drug therapy is confined to three chemotherapeutic agents (methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside, and thiotepa) administered by a variety of schedules either by intralumbar or intraventricular drug delivery. Although treatment of LM is palliative and the expected median survival of patients is 4 to 6 months, it often provides stabilization and protection from further neurological deterioration. In patients with primary CNS lymphoma, CNS prophylaxis has been recommended (using a combination of high-dose systemic chemotherapy and intra-CSF chemotherapy), but the strategy remains controversial because high-dose systemic methotrexate is commonly used as an adjuvant therapy. Patients with primary CNS lymphoma at high risk as defined by positive CSF cytology or neuroradiography consistent with LM may benefit from the inclusion of intra-CSF chemotherapy.",meningitis
"Tuberculosis (TB) is a common disease to threaten human health. TB of the central nervous system (CNS) is rare but the most serious type of systemic TB because of its high mortality rate, serious neurological complications and sequelae. In this case report, we describe a woman who presented with walking instability, intracerebral hemorrhage and leptomeningeal enhancement due to tuberculosis meningitis. The patient had no significant medical history and the initial clinical symptoms were walking instability. On analysis, the cerebrospinal fluid was colorless and transparent, the pressure was more than 400 mm H2O, there was lymphocytic pleocytosis, increased protein, and decreased glucose levels present. No tuberculosis or other bacteria were detected. The patient's brain computed tomography image showed intra-cerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and contrast magnetic resonance imaging showed ICH in the right frontal lob, and leptomeningeal enhancement. CNS TB is rare but has a high mortality rate. As this disease has no unique characteristics at first presentation such as epidemiology and obvious clinical manifestation, a diagnosis of CNS TB remains difficult.",meningitis

"Background: Meningitis is the inflammation of the meninges in response to infection or chemical agents. While aseptic meningitis, most frequently caused by enteroviruses, is usually benign with a self-limiting course, bacterial meningitis remains associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, despite advances in antimicrobial therapy and intensive care. Fast and accurate differential diagnosis is crucial for assertive choice of the appropriate therapeutic approach for each form of meningitis. Methods: We used 2D-PAGE and mass spectrometry to identify the cerebrospinal fluid proteome specifically related to the host response to pneumococcal, meningococcal, and enteroviral meningitis. The disease-specific proteome signatures were inspected by pathway analysis. Results: Unique cerebrospinal fluid proteome signatures were found to the three aetiological forms of meningitis investigated, and a qualitative predictive model with four protein markers was developed for the differential diagnosis of these diseases. Nevertheless, pathway analysis of the disease-specific proteomes unveiled that Kallikrein-kinin system may play a crucial role in the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to brain damage in bacterial meningitis. Proteins taking part in this cellular process are proposed as putative targets to novel adjunctive therapies. Conclusions: Comparative proteomics of cerebrospinal fluid disclosed candidate biomarkers, which were combined in a qualitative and sequential predictive model with potential to improve the differential diagnosis of pneumococcal, meningococcal and enteroviral meningitis. Moreover, we present the first evidence of the possible implication of Kallikrein-kinin system in the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis.",meningitis
"Background: The cause is not found in one third of patients presenting with chronic meningitis. Biopsy of the leptomeninges and brain is often recommended in these patients, but the value of a biopsy is uncertain. Aims: To review the results of leptomeningeal and brain biopsies and their effect on diagnosis and management in patients with chronic meningitis, if the diagnosis was uncertain after clinical assessment, lumbar puncture and radiological investigations. Methods: The clinical features, investigations and the results of leptomeningeal and brain biopsies were reviewed retrospectively in 25 patients presenting with chronic meningitis between 1967 and 1990. Results: The biopsy identified the cause of the chronic meningitis in five patients (neoplastic meningitis in three, tuberculous meningitis in one, granulomatous angiitis in one). In 17 patients the biopsy was abnormal but it did not identify the cause (non-granulomatous lymphocytic meningitis in eight, granulomatous meningitis in two, non-specific abnormalities in seven). In two patients the biopsy was normal and in one patient the tissue was used only for culture. The results of the biopsy led to a beneficial change in treatment in two patients but did not influence management in the other patients. Conclusions: A leptomeningeal and brain biopsy was of limited practical value in diagnosis and management in most patients with chronic meningitis.",meningitis
"Aim: To analyze the clinical features and course of and to define the risk factors for bacterial meningitis in children. Material and methods: Retrospective study of 100 cases of bacterial meningitis in patients aged 0-18 years admitted to the Iasi Infectious Diseases Hospital between 2005 and 2010. Results: We found a clear prevalence in male children (58%) from rural area (67%), with the highest incidence in the age group 2-5 years. A significant percentage of patients (43%) had previous hospitalization, condition which is known as predisposing factor for bacterial meningitis, the most common being ear infections (20%) and height and weight deficit (9%). 71% of patients were admitted within the first 48 h. The most common onset clinical manifestations were fever (84%), vomiting (70%), signs of meningeal irritation (59%), somnolence (23%), loss of appetite (19%), and coma in 5% of patients. In 36% of cases CSF was opalescent with moderate pleocytosis (35%); in 29% of patients CSF albumin level ranged between 0.7-1.0 g, the majority presenting normal glycorahia (71%). In only 21% of cases the microbial agent was identified (pneumococcal and meningococcal etiology, 8% and 6%, respectively). The course was generally favorable, and mortality rate was low (5%). Complications occurred in 3% of patients consisting in hydrocephalus and brain abscess. Conclusions: Bacterial meningitis remains a disease with potentially severe course. Clinical onset, most commonly atypical in children, requires differential diagnosis at the time of admission in order to initiate the most appropriate antibiotic therapy.",meningitis
"Objective: Although signs of meningeal irritation are highly indicative of meningitis, they are not pathognomonic. In this study, we described the final diagnoses in children with signs of meningeal irritation, and we assessed the frequency of bacterial meningitis related to specific signs of meningeal irritation. Methods: Information was collected from records of 326 patients (aged 1 month to 15 years) who visited the emergency department of the Sophia Children's Hospital between 1988 and 1998 with signs of meningeal irritation, assessed by either the general practitioner or the pediatrician. Results: Bacterial meningitis was diagnosed in 99 patients (30%), viral or aseptic meningitis in 43 (13%). Other diagnoses were pneumonia (8%), other serious bacterial infections (2%), and upper respiratory tract infections or other self-limiting diseases (46 %). Presence of one of the signs of meningeal irritation assessed by the pediatrician was related to bacterial meningitis in 39%. Specific tests eliciting meningeal irritation, such as Brudzinski's and Kernig's signs, were not related to a higher frequency of bacterial meningitis than neck stiffness and the tripod phenomenon. In children < or =1 year, bacterial meningitis is more frequently related to presence of irritability and a bulging fontanel. Conclusion: Bacterial meningitis is present in 30% of children with signs of meningeal irritation. Presence of meningeal irritation as assessed by the pediatrician is related to bacterial meningitis in 39%. A better prediction of bacterial meningitis was not achieved by using more specific tests for signs of meningeal irritation.",meningitis
"Background: Tuberculous meningitis is the most severe manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis with a high mortality rate and a high rate of sequelae among survivors. The aim of this study is to assess the current epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic procedures, treatment and outcome in patients with tuberculous meningitis in Denmark, a country with a low tuberculosis incidence. Methods: A nationwide retrospective study was conducted, comprising all patients notified with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) in Denmark from 2000-2008. Medical records were reviewed using a standardised protocol. Results: Fifty patients, including 12 paediatric patients, were identified. 78% of the patients were immigrants from countries of high tuberculosis endemicity. 64% of all patients had a pre-existing immunosuppressive condition; 10% were HIV positive, 48% were HIV seronegative and 42% had an unknown HIV status. Median symptom duration before admission was 14 days in the Danish patient population and 20 days in the immigrant group. Biochemical analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples revealed pleocytosis in 90% with lymphocyte predominance in 66%. Protein levels were elevated in 86%. The most common findings on neuro-radiological imaging were basal meningeal enhancement, tuberculomas and hydrocephalus. Lumbar puncture was performed on 42 patients; 31 of these specimens (74%) had a positive CSF culture for mycobacteria and 9.5% were smear positive for acid-fast bacilli. The overall mortality rate was 19% and 48% of the remaining patients had neurological sequelae of varying degree. Conclusion: TBM is a rare but severe manifestation of extrapulmonary TB in Denmark. The clinician must be prepared to treat empirically if the suspicion of TBM has arisen to improve treatment outcome.",meningitis
"Elevated levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptors (S-IL-2R) but not interleukin-2 (IL-2) activity were found in sera from patients with aseptic meningitis, purulent meningitis, and meningism. Elevated levels of S-IL-2R in serum was also observed in 4/4 patients with bacterial pneumonia and 2/2 patients with infectious mononucleosis. The inflammation of the meninges was only reflected by an increase in S-IL-2R in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 1/14 patients with aseptic meningitis and 3/10 patients with purulent meningitis. Further, IL-2 activity was only demonstrated in CSF from 2 patients with aseptic meningitis and 3 patients with purulent meningitis. In conclusion, neither S-IL-2R nor IL-2 in serum or CSF seem to have any value in the diagnosis of or discrimination between purulent meningitis and aseptic meningitis. Further, the elevation of S-IL-2R in serum is not specific for infections primarily fought by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes such as viral infections, but seems merely to reflect an unspecific activation of the immune system.",meningitis
"Granulomatous meningitis was present in 6/33 bovine fetuses from which Brucella abortus (B. abortus) had been isolated. Meningitis was severe in three fetuses, moderate in one fetus, and mild in the remaining two fetuses. The meningitis was characterized by the infiltration of a mixed population of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages in the leptomeninges. Vasculitis characterized by the infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the vascular wall was observed in the vessels of the cerebral cortices of 4/6 fetuses. Gram negative coccobacilli were present in the cytoplasm of the leptomeningeal macrophages and extracellularly. Brucellar antigens labeled by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method were present in massive amounts in leptomeningeal macrophages and in small foci of stained cells in the choroid plexus and ependyma. The findings indicate that B. abortus is one of pathogens capable of inducing meningitis in bovine fetuses.",meningitis
"Tuberculous meningitis leads to a high mortality rate. However, it responds well to chemotherapy if the treatment is started early. Neuroimaging is one of the most important initial investigations. There were 42 patients diagnosed with tuberculous meningitis in Kuala Lumpur Hospital based on clinical criteria, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and response to anti-tuberculous treatment over a 7 year period. Relevant information was obtained from patients' medical case notes and neuroimaging findings were evaluated. Male to female ratio was 3:1. The three major ethnics and the immigrant groups in Malaysia were represented in this study. The majority of the cases involved the Malays followed by immigrants, Chinese and Indians. The patients' age ranged from 18 to 62 years old with the mean age of 34.4 years. There were 95.2% (n = 40) of patients who presented with various neuroimaging abnormalities and only 2 (4.8%) patients had normal neuroimaging findings. Hydrocephalus and meningeal enhancement were the two commonest neuroimaging features. Other features include infarction, enhancing lesion, tuberculoma, abcess, oedema and calcification. Contrasted CT scan is an adequate neuroimaging tool to unmask abnormal findings in tuberculous meningitis.",meningitis
"Three hundred and forty-nine cases of disease affecting the meninges were observed at the San Bernardino County Charity Hospital in an eight year period.A total of 29 patients with meningococcal, H. influenzae and pneumococcal meningitis were treated. There were four deaths, of which three occurred during the first 24 hours in the hospital. Of 22 cases of unclassified meningitis, four probably were tuberculous, four probably were meningococcal and two probably were of virus origin. Under present treatment programs the differentiation between viral and bacterial meningitides is difficult and it is possible, therefore, that the reported incidence of the two groups may not represent the facts. Of 22 cases of unclassified meningitis, 12 had no specific characteristics which would permit a clinical diagnosis. One of the patients died. Of 70 cases of clinical meningitis, the infecting organism was identified in 69 per cent. Meningococcal meningitis made up only 17 per cent of 70 cases of purulent meningitis observed between July 1, 1945, and July 1, 1948.",meningitis
"Objective: Although meningism manifesting acute headache has been observed to be associated with common viral and bacterial infections, its definition and pathogenesis have not been clarified. Clinical findings and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokines in adult patients with meningism were investigated and compared with those in viral meningitis. Patients and methods: Among the adult inpatients in our hospital from 1997 to 2004, 5 with meningism and 17 with viral meningitis were identified according to the criteria described in this study, and their clinical data were analyzed. In the CSF samples of the 5 patients with meningism and the 17 with viral meningitis, the concentrations of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 were determined using a cytometric bead array. Results: The five patients with meningism all showed fever and meningeal signs such as severe headache and nuchal stiffness without CSF pleocytosis (<5 cells/mm3). Four patients were associated with herpetic Kaposi's eczema, herpes simplex, or herpes zoster, and all five patients had favorable outcomes. The levels of all CSF cytokines in patients with meningism were below normal values, whereas IFN-gamma and IL-6 in patients with viral meningitis were moderately elevated. Conclusion: The normal cytokine levels in meningism may possibly reflect the lack of direct viral infection and may be helpful in differentiating both meningism and viral meningitis at an early stage.",meningitis
"""Tripod Sign"" or ""Amoss's Sign"" is a sign of meningeal irritation. Although useful in diagnosing meningitis, it is not pathognomic and may be seen in a variety of clinical conditions. Infants < 1 year of age and immunocompromised individuals may not demonstrate signs of meningeal irritation. Since elicitation of the sign requires voluntary sitting up, it is of limited use in patients with marked altered sensorium and young infants.",meningitis
"Adenylate kinase activity and lactate concentration were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 5 patients with bacterial meningitis, of 4 patients with probable bacterial meningitis, and of 18 patients with serous meningitis. Furthermore, for comparison measurements were also performed in CSF of 27 patients with meningism. Concomitantly glutathione was measured in CSF in most of the patients. Significantly higher values of these 3 parameters were found in the CSF of patients with bacterial and probable bacterial meningitis compared with those having serous meningitis and meningism. Adenylate kinase activity and lactate concentration in patients with serous meningitis were significantly higher than in those with meningism. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of meningitis studied so far also displayed an adenylate kinase activity in their CSF. The determination of adenylate kinase, lactate and glutathione levels in CSF might be a useful aid for the diagnosis not only of meningitis but also for the discrimination between bacterial and serous meningitis.",meningitis
"A 76-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of convulsions that developed after a 1-month history of progressive right-leg palsy. MRI showed thickening of the meninges with gadolinium enhancement in the left parietal lobe and it revealed pia-subarachnoid space pattern. A lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed no abnormality. Her serum adenosine deaminase level was elevated (28.7 IU/l). The results of serum cultures were normal. To differentially diagnose collagen disease, infection, malignancy, and inflammation of uncommon causes, we conducted brain and meningeal biopsies on the 15th hospital day. Histopathological examination of the brain tissue showed mainly necrosis and inflammation. There was severe pachymeningeal thickening without necrosis. Although it was difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis, a tissue sample taken from under the leptomeninges tested positive for mycobacterium on Ziehl-Neelsen staining. The results of polymerase chain reaction for mycobacterium were negative in the meningeal tissue. The patient received anti-tuberculous drugs, anti-nontuberculous mycobacteriosis drugs, and corticosteroids to treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterium. After starting treatment, the findings on magnetic resonance imaging improved dramatically, and no convulsions occurred during hospitalization. She was discharged on the 153rd hospital day without any neurological deficit. Because previous studies have reported that isolated mycobacterium meningitis is a diagnostically challenging condition, brain and meningeal biopsies should be considered in patients with gadolinium enhancement in the meninges.",meningitis
"A wide range of viral and microbial infections are known to cause meningitis, and there is evidence that the meninges are the gateway to pathogenic invasion of the brain parenchyma. Hence observation of these regions has wide application to understanding host-pathogen interactions. Interactions between pathogens and cells of the immune response can be modified by changes in their environment, such as suppression of the flow of blood and lymph, and, particularly in the case of the meninges, with their unsupported membranes, invasive dissection can alter the tissue architecture. For these reasons, intravital imaging through the unperforated skull is the method of choice. We give a protocol for a simple method of two-photon microscopy through the thinned cortical skull of the anesthetized mouse to enable real-time imaging with sub-micron resolution through the meninges and into the superficial brain parenchyma. In reporter mice in which selected cell types express fluorescent proteins, imaging after infection with fluorescent pathogens (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Trypanosoma brucei or Plasmodium berghei) has shown strong recruitment to the cortical meninges of immune cells, including neutrophils, T cells, and putative dendritic cells and macrophages. Without special labeling, the boundaries between the dura mater, the leptomeninx, and the parenchyma are not directly visualized in intravital two-photon microscopy, but other landmarks and characteristics, which we illustrate, allow the researcher to identify the compartment being imaged. While most infectious meningitides are localized mainly in the dura mater, others involve recruitment of immune cells to the leptomeninx.",meningitis
"Neoplastic meningitis (NM) poses diagnostic challenges and investigations need to be chosen carefully. We present three cases of NM with distinct learning points. In case 1, MRI was diagnostic of melanosis; in case 2, ventricular CSF showed malignant cells when lumbar CSF repeatedly failed to show them; and in the third, whole body PET scan diagnosed the tumour when other tests were negative. A comparative evaluation of various diagnostic modalities used in suspected NM is provided.",meningitis
"Background: Focal basal meningeal enhancement may produce a confusing CT picture in children with suspected tuberculous meningitis (TBM). Objective: To demonstrate the incidence, distribution and appearance of localized basal meningeal enhancement in children with TBM. Materials and methods: CT scans of patients with definite (culture proven) and probable (CSF suggestive) TBM were retrospectively evaluated by two observers. Localized basal enhancement was documented as involving: unilateral cistern of the lateral fossa (CLF), unilateral sylvian fissure, unilateral CLF and sylvian fissure in combination, unilateral CLF and sylvian fissure with ipsi- or contralateral ambient cistern and isolated quadrigeminal plate cistern. Results: The study included 130 patients with TBM (aged 2 months to 13 years 9 months). Focal basal enhancement was seen in 11 patients (8.5%). The sylvian fissure was involved most commonly, followed by the lateral fossa cistern. The ambient cistern was involved in three patients and the quadrigeminal plate cistern in one. Focal areas of enhancement corresponded to the areas of infarction in every patient. Conclusion: Focal basal meningeal enhancement is common (8.5%) in paediatric TBM. This must be kept in mind when evaluating CT scans in children presenting with focal neurological findings, seizures or meningism in communities where TBM is endemic.",meningitis
"Importance: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system traditionally characterized by an initial relapsing-remitting clinical course and focal inflammatory lesions that have a predilection for the periventricular white matter. Recently, however, histopathologic and imaging studies have illustrated a more complex pathologic substrate involving cortical demyelination, gray matter atrophy, and meningeal inflammation. Neuroimaging advances have facilitated improved detection of cortical pathology, but our understanding of the pathogenesis of cortical disease remains incomplete. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current status and future prospects regarding the emerging role of magnetic resonance imaging to visualize leptomeningeal enhancement in patients with MS and place these findings in the proper pathobiologic and clinical context. Observations: Cortical atrophy and demyelination along the subpial surface appear early in the disease course in patients with MS but accelerate in progressive stages. Histopathologic studies of patients have shown the presence of inflammatory infiltrates, in some cases with features of B cell-rich tertiary lymph follicles, along the cortical meningeal surface. Recent magnetic resonance imaging data demonstrate the ability to detect such inflammation using high-resolution gadolinium-enhanced contrast scans by the presence of leptomeningeal enhancement. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging correlation studies indicate that leptomeningeal enhancement is most common in patients with progressive forms of MS and shows a relationship to subpial cortical lesions and cortical atrophy. Conclusions and relevance: A growing body of evidence suggests that gray matter demyelination, cortical atrophy, and leptomeningeal inflammation may be important components of progressive MS pathology and provide a new therapeutic target. Leptomeningeal enhancement may prove a useful surrogate marker for such pathology, perhaps improving our understanding of the natural history of progressive MS, although its ultimate effect on therapeutic development and clinical care requires further study.",meningitis
"Rheumatoid meningitis (RM) is one of the most severe complications of rheumatoid arthritis. The mortality rate of RM is relatively high and diagnosis can be difficult. We present an 80-year-old woman who was diagnosed with microscopic findings of RM after analysis of biopsy specimens taken from a brain lesion. MRI scanning revealed meningeal enhancement in the brain, and the pathological findings were those of meningeal lymphocytic infiltration, vasculitis and rheumatoid nodules. RM is a treatable disease and in this patient RM was diagnosed on the basis of biopsy findings.",meningitis
"Background: Acute bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment it continues to have a high case-fatality rate and high rates of long-term neurologic sequelae. Etiology: Since the widespread use of the vaccine for Haemophilus influenzae type B, Streptococcus pneumoniae has replaced it as the most common cause of acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis in industrialized countries. The rising incidence of beta-lactam-resistant pneumococci has to be considered when choosing a regimen for empiric antibiotic therapy. Diagnosis: The clinical diagnosis remains difficult, as absent clinical meningeal signs do not exclude bacterial meningitis. If bacterial meningitis is considered a possible diagnosis, empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated without any delay. Prior blood cultures and, if not contraindicated, a lumbar puncture should be performed. Based on new evidence, a screening cranial computed tomography to rule out raised intracranial pressure prior to lumbar puncture is recommended only for patients with defined risk factors (age > 60 years; preexisting immunodeficiency, immunosuppression, or neurologic diseases; recent seizures; any pathologic finding in the neurologic examination other than meningism). Treatment: Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated before cranial computed tomography. Adjuvant dexamethasone therapy initiated with or prior to the antibiotic therapy reduces mortality and morbidity for patients with pneumococcal meningitis without increasing the rate of side effects.",meningitis
"Background: Meningitis still accounts for many deaths in children especially during epidemics in countries within the African meningitis belt. Between February and May 2012, the Gambia witnessed an outbreak of meningitis in two of its six regions. This study presents a clinical perspective of this outbreak in central river region of the Gambia. It evaluated the outbreak pattern, clinical features, and mortality among suspected cases that presented to the hospital during the outbreak. Methodology: This is a prospective observational study of suspected cases of meningitis that presented to the pediatric ward of the Bansang Hospital during the outbreak period. Confirmed cases of meningitis were consecutively enrolled, and those with negative blood cultures presenting during the same period were employed as controls. Result: Two hundred and four suspected cases of meningitis presented to the pediatric ward during the outbreak. Ninety were confirmed as meningitis cases. The W135 strain of Neisseria meningitidis was responsible for 89 (98.9%) of meningitis cases seen with an incidence rate of 74.9/100,000 in children (0-14 years) and in-hospital case fatality rate of 7.9%. Highest attack rate was among the 12-49 months age group. Clinical features such as meningeal signs (neck stiffness), conjunctivitis, and joint swelling were seen more in cases than controls. Contact history with relatives, who had fever in previous 2 weeks prior to illness was significantly seen more in cases. Adjusted regression analysis showed 7.5 more likelihood of infection with positive contact history (odds ratio [OR]: 7.2 confidence interval [CI]: [3.39-15.73]). There was no significant difference in death outcome between cases and controls (OR: 0.78 CI: [0.29-2.13]). The double peak wave-like pattern of the epidemic curve noted during this outbreak suggests a disseminated outbreak originating from an index case with propagated spread. Conclusion: There is need for more effective surveillance and incorporation of vaccine against meningitis into the expanded program on immunization schedule of the Gambia and other countries within the meningitic epidemic belt.",meningitis
"Four patients, with an additional seven from the literature, had meningitis following a lumbar puncture (LP) that disclosed normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Animal studies demonstrate that perforation of the meninges in the presence of bacteremia enhances the development of meningitis. Simultaneous blood culture should be obtained with all LPs. Regardless of the results of the initial LP, a second CSF examination is recommended in any patient whose clinical condition is deteriorating. If the initial blood culture is positive, a second LP should be strongly considered in all newborn and very young infants.",meningitis
"The clinical, pathological and laboratory findings of a 3-year-old boy with proven primary amoebic meningo-encephalitis are described. The EEG showed changes of acute cortical necrosis lateralised to one temporal lobe and was similar to that described with Herpes simplex encephalitis. CT scan findings indicated acute cortical inflammation and basal arachnoiditis. The disease should be suspected in the context of acute pyogenic meningitis when no organisms are isolated. Treatment with amphotericin-B, miconazole and rifampicin has been effective in previously reported patients.",meningitis
"Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is endemic in the developing world but is becoming more common in the United States because of immigration. Although NCC is pleomorphic in its presentation, extraparenchymal NCC may be challenging to diagnose and treat. Extraparenchymal NCC is probably more frequent than previously thought. Neurologists and neuroradiologists in the United States are often unaware of the pretreatment/post-treatment radiographic patterns of extraparenchymal NCC and the potentially poor prognosis if not correctly diagnosed and managed. The review of this condition is important given increasing incidence in the United States.",meningitis
"In the past two decades, the advent of CT and MRI has made a considerable impact on the evaluation of meningeal diseases, conditions once regulated to cytological, histopathological, or postmortem analyses alone. This article reviews the imaging findings in various meningeal processes with particular attention to the anatomic definition of the meningeal layers and their relationship to the development of meningeal pathology and consequent imaging characteristics.",meningitis
"A 49-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with recurrent episodes of paresthesia attacks evolving in 5 to 15 minutes from the left hand to the left leg through the left trunk. Neurological examination revealed cortical sensory disturbance in her left hand. Although contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI findings were unremarkable, contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI revealed abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement over the sulcus of the parietal lobe, including the sulcus around the postcentral gyrus. Because we assumed the cause of the recurrent sensory attack to be meningeal inflammation around the primary somatosensory cortex, we treated this patient by increasing the dose of prednisolone. The increase in prednisolone dose completely resolved the symptom, as well as the abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement on contrast-enhanced FLAIR MRI. In patients with suspected meningeal inflammation, contrast-enhanced FLAIR MRI, which is reported to be more sensitive than contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI in detecting subtle abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement, should be the modality of choice.",meningitis
"Liquor:serum quotients of IgG and albumin in patients with meningism, meningitis and multiple sclerosis have been studied. Abnormal quotients indicative of disturbed blood-brain barrier function and/or intrathecal IgG synthesis were found in various proportions of all 3 groups of patients. In some patients with aseptic meningitis and meningism, the abnormal quotients were comparable with those found in patients with multiple sclerosis. The reason for this is unknown. An unspecific reaction to febrile illness may be involved. As a consequence, the findings of abnormal liquor:serum quotients of IgG and albumin should be evaluated with great caution in patients with recent or present febrile illness.",meningitis
"Anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is a rare, potentially life-threatening drug reaction which usually occurs after exposure to aromatic antiepileptics. AHS secondary to non-aromatic antiepileptics is even more rare and there are only few case reports of AHS presenting as aseptic meningitis. We present the case of a 48-year-old patient who presented with meningism within 3 weeks of adding lamotrigine for control of her juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. When lamotrigine was restarted 2 weeks later she developed similar but more severe symptoms which resolved on stopping lamotrigine. Our patient was subsequently rendered seizure free on levetiracetam which has not so far been linked with this syndrome. It is important to be aware of this life-threatening complication associated with the use of antiepileptics.",meningitis

"Objective: Our goal was to characterize the patterns of meningeal enhancement in postcontrast MR images and correlate these patterns with the clinical disorders. Materials and methods: The MR scans, medical records, and laboratory findings of 83 patients, whose postcontrast MR studies of the head demonstrated meningeal enhancement, were reviewed retrospectively. The patterns of enhancement of the different layers of the meninges were divided into two types: leptomeningeal (pia and arachnoid), when enhancement of the meninges followed the convolutions of the gyri and/or involved the meninges around the basal cisterns; and pachymeningeal (dura), when the enhancement was thick and linear or nodular along the inner surface of the calvarium, falx, or tentorium without extension into the cortical gyri or basal cistern involvement. Enhancement around the basal cistern was considered leptomeningeal, since the dura-arachnoid is widely separated from the pia-arachnoid in this region. Further, the meningeal enhancement was divided into five etiologic subgroups, i.e., carcinomatous, infectious, inflammatory, reactive, and chemical. The medical history, clinical presentation, and findings on CSF analysis were used to distinguish infectious from carcinomatous meningitis. Meningeal enhancement due to surgery, shunt, or trauma was considered reactive, while ruptured cysts (dermoid or cysticercoid) or intrathecal chemotherapy were classified as chemical meningitis. Meningitis secondary to involvement by collagen vascular disease or sarcoidosis was considered to be inflammatory. Results: Thirty of the 83 subjects had carcinomatous, 28 infectious, 14 reactive, 8 chemical, and 3 inflammatory etiology for meningitis. Twenty-five cases (83%) of the carcinomatous, 14 (100%) of the reactive, 3 (100%) of the inflammatory, and 1 (12%) of the chemical meningitis subgroups demonstrated pachymeningeal enhancement, while 28 cases (100%) of the infectious meningitis and 7 (78%) of the chemical meningitis subgroups had leptomeningeal enhancement. Only five cases (17%) of the carcinomatous meningitis subgroup showed leptomeningeal enhancement. Four of these five cases were as a result of direct spread of intraparenchymal tumors or through perineural extension, rather than hematogenous involvement. Only one patient with carcinomatous meningitis demonstrated leptomeningeal enhancement without clear intraparenchymal lesion. Conclusion: The recognition of various patterns of meningeal enhancement (leptomeningitis versus pachymeningitis) may help in differentiating between infectious and carcinomatous meningitis. This study demonstrated that infectious meningitis presents mostly as leptomeningitis, while carcinomatous meningitis presents as pachymeningitis.",meningitis
"Meningeal involvement is a rare occurrence in Wegener's Granulomatosis (WG). A Medline search uncovered only 48 previously reported cases. Here we describe the clinical features of meningeal involvement in WG and to evaluate the association with systemic disease extension. Through a systematic literature review of papers concerning meningeal involvement in WG, we collected and analysed data about sex, age, disease extension, symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid examination, imaging, ANCA and histology about previously reported patients. Headache is almost always the first symptom of meningeal involvement in WG. Later in the course of the disease other abnormalities may develop. Among them cranial nerve palsy, seizures and encephalopathy are the most frequent. Diagnosis is obtained by neuroimaging, which may disclose two distinct patterns of meningeal thickening: diffuse or focal. 62.9% of patients tests positive for ANCA. Histology typically shows necrotizing granulomatosis. Meningeal involvement is by far more frequent in the setting of localized WG. Meningitis is a rare complication of WG. It usually develops in patients with localized disease who are more likely to have destructive lesions of the upper airways. It may be recognized by a constellation of clinical and radiological findings and by histological signs of necrotizing granulomatosis, with little or no vasculitis.",meningitis
"Neurosarcoidosis is difficult to diagnose, because definite diagnosis requires detailed histology of the central nervous system. Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (CE-FLAIR) is more useful for detecting leptomeningeal lesions compared with 3D CE-T1 weighted imaging. However, the clinical diagnostic utility of 3D CE-FLAIR for neurosarcoidosis is unclear. We describe a case of a 46-year-old Japanese woman who was admitted to our department due to chronic headache with fever and diplopia. Using 3D CE-FLAIR, we performed brain biopsy from right cerebellar lesion. The histological examination revealed typical non-caseating granulomas, indicating neurosarcoidosis. Our findings suggest that 3D CE-FLAIR may detect leptomeningeal lesions that are candidates for biopsy in chronic meningitis undetermined etiology.",meningitis
"Clinical and autopsy records of eight adults with non-traumatic gram-negative bacillary meningitis who were admitted to the hospitals of the Wayne State University--Detroit Medical Center during the years 1964 to 1974 were reviewed. There were five community-acquired cases, and five patients died. Escherichia coli was the causative enteric bacillus in six cases. Community-acquired infections were due to Esch. coli in four of the patients. Each of the patients with a community-acquired infection was a chronic alcoholic. Esch. coli bronchopneumonias, urinary infections, and bacteremias seeding the meninges were usual. Shunting contaminated portal venous blood through the liver in patients with Laennec's cirrhosis, or bypassing the liver with similar infected blood from a genitourinary source by way of Batson's perivertebral plexus draining into the cerebral dural sinuses may be important in the pathogenesis of these infrequent cases of nontraumatic gram-negative bacillary meningitis. Spontaneous gram-negative bacteremias, peritonitis, bronchopneumonias, and now ""meningitis"" may be a constellation of special complications of the alcoholic. Mortality among 25 patients with Esch. coli meningitis reported from 1922 to 1974 is approximately 50%, and has not changed appreciably during the antibiotic era. Mortality, however, is significantly higher in nosocomially acquired cases. Early and more recent cases have had bloody, xanthochromic pleocytoses indicative of leptomeningeal arterial and venous vasculitis, and far advanced disease. Since causative/enteric bacilli have been susceptible to antimicrobial agents employed, another mode of antibacterial administration, perhaps utilizing parenteral plus intraventricular dosing, particularly for patients acquiring their infections in the hospital, may be required.",meningitis
"Two adult, female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) became depressed, weak, anorectic, and adipsic. Auscultation of the thorax of 1 monkey revealed bilateral harsh rales. Neither monkey responded to therapeutic doses of antibiotics, and both died soon after treatment was started. Meningitis was demonstrated histologically and pure cultures of multiply antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella were isolated from the brains of both monkeys. Of 13 clinically normal rhesus monkeys in the same facility, 5 had multiply antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella spp in their pharynges.",meningitis
"Background and purpose: To our knowledge, the upper limits of the thickness of normal meninges on neurosonograms are not known. We therefore established a nomogram for sonographic measurements of the leptomeninges (pia-glial plate) and assessed its usefulness in neurosonographic examinations of children with bacterial meningitis. Methods: The pia mater-cortical glia limitans complex on the surface of the brain and in the sulcus of a frontal gyrus was measured on neurosonograms in 100 infants without meningeal disease in order to establish a nomogram of the thickness of this pia-glial plate, referred to as the leptomeninx. Effects of prematurity, age, sex, and single-layer (surface) versus double-layer (sulcus) measurements were analyzed. Meningeal thicknesses derived from a retrospective analysis of the neurosonograms of 33 patients with purulent meningitis and a prospective study of 22 patients with bacterial meningitis were compared with the nomograms. Clinical outcomes of children with meningeal thickening were compared with those of affected children with normal meninges. Results: The distribution of sulci measurements was significantly asymmetrical around the mean. Statistical data showed no influence of prematurity and sex, but showed surface measurements to be more consistent than sulcal measurements. Older chronological age was related to slightly larger sulci, but did not influence the surface measurements. In children with bacterial meningitis, the surface meninges were less frequently thickened than were the sulci. Sulcal enlargement occurred often in combination with echogenic deposits in the sub-arachnoid space. Conclusion: Leptomeninges are best measured on the surface of a gyrus rather than in a sulcus, as the normal thickness of the sulci shows much more variability. Clinical outcome of bacterial meningitis cannot be predicted by presence or absence of meningeal thickening as the only sonographic abnormality.",meningitis

"IgG4-related disease has evolved from originally being recognized as a form of pancreatitis to encompass diseases of numerous organs including the hypophysis and one reported case of dural involvement. A search of the University of Virginia, Division of Neuropathology files for 10 years identified ten cases of unexplained lymphoplasmacytic meningeal inflammation that we then evaluated using immunohistochemical stains for IgG4 and IgG. Ten control cases including sarcoidosis (4), tuberculosis (1), bacterial abscess (2), Langerhans cell histiocytosis (2), and foreign body reaction (1) were also examined. The number of IgG4-positive plasma cells was counted in five high power fields (HPFs) and an average per HPF was calculated. Cases that contained greater than ten IgG4-positive cells/HPF were considered to be IgG4-related. Five of the study cases met these criteria, including one case of leptomeningeal inflammation. All cases exhibited the typical histological features of IgG4-related disease including lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, fibrosis, and phlebitis. The dural-based lesions appear to represent a subset of the cases historically diagnosed as idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis. While the leptomeningeal process most closely resembles non-vasculitic autoimmune inflammatory meningoencephalitis. Given these findings, IgG4-related meningitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of meningeal inflammatory lesions after stringent clinical and histologic criteria are used to rule out other possible diagnoses.",meningitis
"Although the meninges are often thought of simplistically as a connective tissue sac that contains the CSF and the contents of the CNS, they are far more complex. Anatomically, they comprise several layers. Pathologically, numerous disease processes may affect the meninges; different processes may even involve different areas of the meninges. These factors all influence the MR imaging characteristics of meningeal lesions. This review briefly discusses the anatomy of the meninges, the MR imaging technique when meningeal disease is suspected, and the appearance of the normal meninges. It then focuses on tumors, infections, cysts, and other lesions that primarily involve the meninges, excluding lesions that secondarily involve the meninges.",meningitis
"We previously found that 97% of children diagnosed with chronic tension-type headaches had meningismus. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between streptococcal infection and meningismus in children suffering from chronic headaches. Six hundred and forty children suffering from idiopathic chronic headaches were examined by a neurologist in an outpatient setting. Antistreptolysin titer (ASOT) was determined from blood samples taken from all the children. Meningismus was diagnosed in 337 patients. Patients were divided into two groups: 337 children (Group 1) with meningismus with an increased ASOT (200-1790 IU/ml) in 264 children (78%), and 303 children (Group 2) without meningismus with an increased ASOT (200-1030 IU/ml) in 117 children (39%). We report herein that a majority of children with headaches associated with meningismus, had evidence of a streptococcal infection when compared to a non-meningismus group. We postulate that streptococcal infection may play an important role in the etiology of meningismus-positive chronic headaches in children.",meningitis
"The structural organization of the dura and leptomeninges is reflected in its magnetic resonance (MR) imaging appearance in normal and disease states. Two distinct enhancement patterns are characterized: dura-arachnoid enhancement and pia-subarachnoid space enhancement. The dura-arachnoid pattern consists of curvilinear enhancement overlying the brain and immediately deep to the inner table of the calvaria, as well as along the falx and tentorium. Pial enhancement closely follows the brain surface into sulci and outlines the basal cisterns. Recognition of these enhancement patterns and other MR imaging characteristics may enhance the role of MR imaging in the detection, diagnosis, and follow-up of neoplastic and nonneoplastic disorders affecting the meninges. The focus of this article (Part I) is the MR appearance of the normal meninges and nonneoplastic causes of meningeal disease. Part II of this series will discuss neoplastic conditions affecting the coverings of the brain and spinal cord with an emphasis on pathways of disease spread.",meningitis
"Two hundred and ten patients with meningismus and the infections of the central nervous system (CNS) with the clinical symptoms and signs of the acute serous meningitis syndrome, were divided in to groups according to etiology (enterovirus meningitis-ENTERO, serous meningitis various etiology-SM and tuberculous meningitis-TBC). Intrathecal synthesis (ITS) of C3c and C4 complement components and IgG were determined by the method of cerebrospinal indexes (I), to examine their role in differential diagnosis of this syndrome. Correlative study between the CSF/serum ratio (Q) for albumin (Alb) and QC3c and QC4 in patients with no proven ITS of this two complement proteins, and the comparative study of the increased value of C3cI and C4I (and IgGI) between the examined groups of the patients was done. Highly significant correlations were found between QAlb and QC3c (r = 0.89, p < 0.001) and QC4 (r = 0.85, p < 0.001). In 22.4% of the examined patients ITS of C3c and C4 were found. There was no difference in frequency of ITS of the two complement proteins between the examined groups, nor inside any particular group. TBC group had significantly lower (p < 0.05) intensity of ITS of C3c and C4 than MNG and ENTERO, and significantly higher intensity of ITS of IgG (p < 0.05) than the other tested groups. CSF index was confirmed as a valid method to detect intrathecal C3c and C4 production. Determination of ITS C3c and C4 could not be of great help in differential diagnosis in the acute serous meningitis syndrome. The intensity of ITS of C3c and C4, related to the intensity of ITS of IgG, could be of help in the determination of the duration of the disease.",meningitis
"Background: Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis (IHCP) is an uncommon disease of unknown etiology characterized by thickening of the cerebral dura mater with possible associated inflammation. The most frequently described clinical symptoms include headache, cranial nerve palsy, and cerebellar dysfunction. Epilepsy and/or status epilepticus as main presentation is very uncommon. Case presentation: Two consecutive cases are presented of patients manifesting focal status epilepticus secondary to IHCP, with clinical, laboratory [blood test and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis], neuroradiologic [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 Tesla and digital subtraction angiography (DSA)], and therapeutic data. One patient underwent meningeal biopsy; pathology findings are also included. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in clinical improvement in both cases, and neuroimaging showed decreased abnormal morphology, compared to initial findings. Conclusion: In the diagnostic approach to focal status epilepticus or epilepsy, IHCP must be considered a potential, although extremely infrequent, cause. Anti-inflammatory treatment is an effective addition to antiepileptic drug therapy in patients with IHCP.",meningitis
"Peripheral infection by Trypanosoma brucei, the protozoan responsible for sleeping sickness, activates lymphocytes, and, at later stages, causes meningoencephalitis. We have videoed the cortical meninges and superficial parenchyma of C56BL/6 reporter mice infected with T.b.brucei. By use of a two-photon microscope to image through the thinned skull, the integrity of the tissues was maintained. We observed a 47-fold increase in CD2+ T cells in the meninges by 12 days post infection (dpi). CD11c+ dendritic cells also increased, and extravascular trypanosomes, made visible either by expression of a fluorescent protein, or by intravenous injection of furamidine, appeared. The likelihood that invasion will spread from the meninges to the parenchyma will depend strongly on whether the trypanosomes are below the arachnoid membrane, or above it, in the dura. Making use of optical signals from the skull bone, blood vessels and dural cells, we conclude that up to 40 dpi, the extravascular trypanosomes were essentially confined to the dura, as were the great majority of the T cells. Inhibition of T cell activation by intraperitoneal injection of abatacept reduced the numbers of meningeal T cells at 12 dpi and their mean speed fell from 11.64 ± 0.34 μm/min (mean ± SEM) to 5.2 ± 1.2 μm/min (p = 0.007). The T cells occasionally made contact lasting tens of minutes with dendritic cells, indicative of antigen presentation. The population and motility of the trypanosomes tended to decline after about 30 dpi. We suggest that the lymphocyte infiltration of the meninges may later contribute to encephalitis, but have no evidence that the dural trypanosomes invade the parenchyma.",meningitis
"We report seven patients with cranial pachymeningitis of unknown origin in whom the main clinical features were headaches, ataxia, and cranial nerve palsies. CSF showed inflammatory changes. CT and MRI showed thickening of the falx and of the tentorium. The clinical course was chronic. Four patients improved with prednisolone but became steroid-dependent: in two cases, radiotherapy had no lasting improvement and in one, azathioprine permitted a reduction of the corticosteroids. Five patients had biopsy of the tentorium cerebelli or of the temporal dura mater. In two cases, autopsy revealed extensive pachymeningitis without parenchymal changes. In all instances, microscopic examination of the dura mater showed a cellular infiltrate of polymorphic cells; there were no epithelioid granulomas. Review of the literature discloses seven similar cases. We discuss the relationship of these lesions with inflammatory meningeal masses, the focal pachymeningitis of the Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, and multifocal fibrosis.",meningitis
"In a previous study we devised a diagnostic decision rule to improve management of children with meningeal signs, suspected of having bacterial meningitis. The decision rule aimed to guide decisions on (1) whether a lumbar puncture is necessary in children with meningeal signs, and (2) which children need hospitalisation and empirical antibiotic treatment for bacterial meningitis. In this study we assessed the validity of this rule in an external population of four (paediatric) hospitals in The Netherlands. The decision rule included two scoring algorithms using symptoms, signs and quickly available blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) laboratory tests. To evaluate the discriminative value of both algorithms, the absolute numbers of correctly diagnosed patients and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve were estimated, and compared with the results from the original population (n = 360). In a 18 month period, we included 226 children, median age 2.2 years, who visited the emergency department with meningeal signs. Bacterial meningitis was present in 25 (11%). Using the scoring algorithms patients could be categorised in groups of increasing risk of bacterial meningitis. The discriminative values of the clinical and CSF algorithm in this new population were similar to those in the original population. In the total population of 586 children with meningeal signs, the rule selected 205 children (35%) who did not need a lumbar puncture and 366 children who did not need empirical treatment (62%). In conclusion, this diagnostic rule performed well in a new population of children with meningeal signs. This diagnostic decision rule is a valuable tool for the clinician when deciding to treat these children for bacterial meningitis and thus improving their management.",meningitis
"Background and purpose: CNS tuberculosis may simulate other granulomas and meningitis on MR images. The purpose of this study was to improve the characterization of lesions in CNS tuberculosis and to assess the disease load using magnetization transfer (MT) imaging. Methods: A total of 107 tuberculomas in seven patients with or without meningitis and 15 patients with tuberculosis meningitis alone were studied. Fifteen patients with cysticercus granulomas with T2 hypointensity, five patients each with viral and pyogenic meningitis, and two patients with cryptococcal meningitis were also studied. The MT ratios were calculated from tuberculomas, cysticercus granulomas, and thickened meninges in tuberculous, viral, pyogenic, and cryptococcal meningitis and were compared within each pathologic group and with the MT ratio of different regions of normal brain parenchyma. Detectability of lesions on T1-weighted MT spin-echo (SE) images was compared with that on conventional SE and postcontrast MT-SE images. Results: Thickened meninges appeared hyperintense relative to surrounding brain parenchyma in the basal and supratentorial cisterns on precontrast MT-SE images in all 18 patients with tuberculosis meningitis. These meninges were not seen or were barely visible on conventional SE images, and enhanced on postcontrast MT-SE images. The MT ratio from the thickened meninges of tuberculous meningitis was significantly lower than that from the meninges in cryptococcal and pyogenic disease and significantly higher than the meninges in viral meningoencephalitis. The MT ratio from T2 visible and invisible tuberculomas appeared to be significantly lower than that of normal white matter. The MT ratio of T2 hypointense cysticercus granuloma was significantly higher than that of T2 hypointense tuberculoma. Conclusion: Precontrast MT-SE imaging helps to better assess the disease load in CNS tuberculosis by improving the detectability of the lesions. With the use of MT ratios, it may be possible to differentiate tuberculosis from similar-appearing infective lesions on MR images.",meningitis
"Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis (IHP) represents a rare inflammatory condition that affects the central nervous system, often difficult to treat. We report the case of a patient who presented with difficulty in swallowing, slurred speech and ataxia associated with headache, vomiting and weight loss. He was diagnosed with IHP. He deteriorated despite treatment with high dose steroids and other immunosuppressants, including pulsed cyclophosphamide. Mycophenolate mofetil was therefore administered resulting in improvement and stabilization. This is the first report in English literature of the use of mycophenolate mofetil in the treatment of IHP and could stimulate further research in its efficacy in managing this condition.",meningitis
"Background: Clinical features of echovirus 6 and 9 infections in children have not been comprehensively evaluated, particularly for sporadic cases. Objective: To describe the clinical features of children with echovirus 6 or 9 infections. Study designs: From 2000 to 2008, 199 children with culture-proven echovirus 6 or 9 infections identified in a university-affiliated hospital were included. Data extracted from 174 inpatients were further analyzed. Results: Age ranged from 4 days to 15 years with a mean of 4.7 years. 123 (62%) were male. The disease spectrums were similar for echovirus 6 (n=100) and 9 (n=74) infections, with aseptic meningitis (49% and 51%, respectively) being the most common syndrome, followed by meningismus, upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, and herpangina. All 174 inpatients had fever but the duration of fever was significantly longer in patient with echovirus 9 infection than those with echovirus 6 infections (6.0 days vs. 3.8 days, p<0.001). The rate of leukocytosis (leukocyte count>15,000/μL) were significantly higher in patients with echovirus 6 infections than those with echovirus 9 infection (p<0.001). One neonate with echovirus 6 infection died from hepatic necrosis with coagulopathy, and one infant with echovirus 6 infection and one child with echovirus 9 infection died from brain involvement. Two children had long-term sequelae of seizure disorder. The remaining 169 children (97%) recovered uneventfully. Conclusion: For children with echovirus 6 or 9 infections requiring hospitalization, aseptic meningitis was the most common manifestation and fatal outcome or long-term sequel, though rare, might occur.",meningitis
"Two young men had similar nonobstructive idiopathic pachymeningitis cervicalis hypertrophica, causing chronic (13 and 11 years respectively) C8-T1 radiculomyelopathy proved by surgical and pathological findings. The preoperative Queckenstedt tests and myelography showed no evidence of CSF obstruction. These unusual findings contrast with previous reports which all described complete or at least partial, block. The findings on metrizamide computed tomogram have not been described before. In the two patients it revealed diffuse cord atrophy from C7 to T2 and hemiatrophy with lateral beaking from C4 to C7. The patients benefited from multiple transverse durotomies. The main pathogenesis of the cord atrophy was the compromizing of feeding radicular arteries rather than direct compression.",meningitis
"Introduction: Hypertrophic pachymeningitis is a clinical condition that is caused by a diffuse or localised thickening of the dura mater. It predominantly affects males and manifests as chronic headache, with or without association to neurological manifestations, such as paralysis of the cranial nerves, cerebellar ataxia and neuro-ophthalmic complications. Case report: A 61-year-old male, with no relevant past history, who, one month before admission, had begun to suffer from right frontotemporal headache that irradiated to the ipsilateral orbital region and was more pronounced at night. A week later he was affected by a decrease in visual acuity in the right eye and two weeks later he noted the presence of right palpebral ptosis, while the headaches increased. The examination showed: right palpebral ptosis with global ophthalmoparesis with predominance of adduction and abduction, and diminished photomotor reflex in the right eye. The visual acuity of the right eye was reduced and the palpebral fissure was 0 in the right eye. The fundus oculi was normal. Infectious and non-infectious causations of meningitis were precluded. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a diffuse thickening of the supratentorial and infratentorial meninges, as well as diffuse uptake of the paramagnetic substance; thickening of the mucus in both paranasal maxillary sinuses was also observed. A meningeal biopsy study confirmed the existence of hypertrophic pachymeningitis. Treatment was established with prednisone and the clinical symptoms improved. Conclusions: Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis is an underdiagnosed condition that must be taken into consideration in cases of patients with a history of subacute or chronic meningitis in which infectious and non-infectious causations have been precluded, and high-dose steroid treatment must be established.",meningitis
"Objective: Neonatal candidemia is an increasing cause of infant morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the current medical literature in an effort to critique the literature and to document the reported prevalences of end-organ damage after neonatal candidemia. Methods: We analyzed all peer-reviewed articles of neonatal candidemia published in the English language; inclusion criteria included a cohort limited to all neonatal intensive care unit admissions or all episodes of candidemia in neonates. Articles that also incorporated older patients, did not define a numerator and a denominator for at least 1 form of end-organ damage, included patients from other reports, or did not include all episodes of candidemia in the source population were excluded from the analysis. Results: Thirty-four articles reported episodes of candidemia and mortality; 21 articles reported prevalence for at least 1 form of end-organ damage. Only 4 (19%) of 21 articles reported prevalence for >4 forms of end-organ damage from the following list: endophthalmitis, meningitis, brain parenchyma invasion, endocarditis, renal abscesses, positive cultures from other normally sterile body fluids, or hepatosplenic abscesses. The median reported prevalence of endophthalmitis was 3% (interquartile range [IQR]: 0%-17%), of meningitis was 15% (IQR: 3%-23%), of brain abscess or ventriculitis was 4% (IQR: 3%-21%), of endocarditis was 5% (IQR: 0%-13%), of positive renal ultrasound was 5% (IQR: 0%-14%), and of positive urine culture was 61% (IQR: 40%-76%). The medical literature concerning end-organ evaluation after episodes of neonatal candidemia is heterogeneous and consists largely of single-center retrospective studies. Year that the data were collected and prevalence of neonates infected with Candida albicans were associated with observed heterogeneity. Conclusions: Given the heterogeneity of the medical literature, precise estimates of the frequencies of end-organ damage are not possible and a prospective multicenter trial is warranted, but the data from the published literature suggest that the prevalence of neonates with end-organ damage not only is greater than 0 but also is high enough that until such a prospective trial is completed, end-organ studies should be considered before the conclusion of antifungal therapy.",meningitis
"A retrospective study of 28 patients identified with subdural empyema (SE) at the Department of Neurosurgery between the years 1995 and 2005 was carried out. SE occurred in all patients following bacterial meningitis. The six most frequently encountered clinical features included: (1) fever in 22 (79%) patients; (2) disturbed consciousness in 16 (57%) patients; (3) papilledema in 11 (39%) patients; (4) hemiparesis in 4 (14%) patients; (5) meningismus or meningeal signs in 4 (14%) patients, and (6) seizures in 3 (11%) patients. In the majority of cases, the most frequent causative pathogen of SE was Staphylococcus aureus. Surgery was performed on all patients, which included craniotomy in a group of 20 patients and burr hole drainage in a group of 8 patients. In conclusion, we believe that infants and young children should be carefully monitored following meningitis, in case of SE development, and that surgical intervention in patients presenting with meningitis may facilitate the development of SE. Furthermore, from a surgical point of view, our experience has led us to believe that craniotomy in comparison with burr hole surgery is the best surgical modality for management of SE as the recurrence rate of SE associated with burr hole surgery is high.",meningitis
"A rare case of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) causing unilateral thickening of meninges, is described here. The 50 year old male is presented with hemicranial headache and unilateral multiple cranial nerve involvement without any long tract signs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan including enhanced studies showed a hemicranial thickening of the meninges. Biopsy of the meninges revealed tuberculosis. The patient improved gradually on antitubercular treatment (ATT). Follow-up at 6 months revealed significant improvement in neurological status. Though tuberculous involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is very common in India, hemicranial meningeal involvement has never been reported.",meningitis
"Neck stiffness is the most important sign of meningitis. When the neck is flexed, the inflamed nerve roots and meninges of the cervical region get stretched. This causes protective muscle spasm manifesting as neck stiffness. Kernig's sign represents similar phenomena involving the distal spinal cord and related nerves. A manoeuvre that stretches the neural elements of the whole length of the spinal canal simultaneously will be a more sensitive test for meningeal irritation. Eliciting neck stiffness while the patient sits up with knees extended achieves this. This method is more sensitive, specific, and amenable to objective assessment.",meningitis
"Serum creatine kinase was assessed in 94 consecutive patients without convulsions admitted to hospital due to suspicion of infection of the central nervous system. No reliable discrimination between patients with aseptic and those with bacterial meningitis was obtained. Patients with bacterial meningitis and brain oedema, as well as patients with encephalitis, had significantly higher values (P less than 0.01) than patients with meningism, aseptic meningitis and bacterial meningitis without cerebral oedema. Very high values, above 2500 U/1, were encountered in only the most severe cases of bacterial meningitis. The highest serum CK value found in patients with encephalitis was 725 U/l. Reference values for control patients with meningism were 16-269 U/1. In a subset of 9 patients creatine kinase isoenzyme analysis was performed. In all cases only muscle type (MM) isoenzyme was found.",meningitis
"Enzymatic determinations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and creatine kinase BB (CK-BB) were performed in 16 patients with aseptic meningitis (AM), in 25 children with bacterial meningitis (BM) and in 15 patients with meningism. The activity of AST and GGT was significantly higher in patients with BM on admission compared with those with AM and meningism (p < 0.05 and p < 0.005, respectively) and decreased with therapy. The highest concentration of AST and LDH appeared in patients with poor outcome as well as in those with ventriculomegaly on neurosonography (p < 0.05). The concentration of CK-BB increased in all patient groups on admission and remained higher on termination of therapy. The present study confirms the high activity of AST and GGT in BM patients in the CSF whereas the increased activity of AST and LDH reflects the extent of brain injury. Nevertheless, the prognosis for individual patients cannot be established on the basis of enzyme activity alone, but depends on several factors.",meningitis
"In a review of 53 cases of coccidioidal disease, 50 of which resulted in death, some symptoms were noted to be so common as to facilitate diagnosis. Laboratory studies of spinal fluid gave helpful information. Particularly noteworthy with regard to roentgenologic studies was the fact that in no case in which there was pulmonary cavity formation due to coccidioidomycosis did coccidioidal meningitis develop.",meningitis
"A 40 year-old woman with subacute headache and visual impairment was admitted. Neurological examination revealed meningismus, diminished visual acuity, bilateral sixth cranial nerve palsy, and papillary edema. Dermatologic examination was normal. The brain CT scan showed hydrocephalus and hyperdense edging around fissures and sulci. The CSF study showed an increased protein level, with persistently negative microbiologic and cytological studies. Prior to Gd-DPTA injection, the brain T1-WI MRI revealed leptomeningeal hyperintensity. A dark subpial substance became evident at cerebral biopsy. The histopatological diagnosis was diffuse leptomeningeal melanomatosis. This case report highlights the diagnostic value of the brain MRI findings in primary leptomeningeal melanomatosis, a rare pathologic condition diagnosed in most published cases only after necropsy. Meningeal T1-WI hyperintensity prior to contrast injection is not caused by sarcoidosis or meningeal carcinomatosis, lymphomatosis or gliomatosis.",meningitis
"Objective: The purpose of our study was to examine the spectrum of abnormalities seen on MR imaging in patients with tubercular spinal arachnoiditis. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis of MR findings in 22 cases of tubercular spinal arachnoiditis was carried out. The diagnosis had been established on the basis of clinical features, evidence of associated tubercular meningitis or of tubercular spondylitis, and CSF analysis. Results: Nineteen (86%) patients had involvement of more than one spinal region, with the dorsal region being most commonly involved. CSF showed increased signal intensity on T1-weighted images in 17 (77%) patients, leading to complete loss of cord-CSF interface in seven patients and shaggy cord outline in 10 patients. As suggested by increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images, we saw cord involvement in 18 (82%) patients. Three of these patients had evidence of cord cavitation. Other findings seen on unenhanced images were CSF loculations in five patients, nodules in subarachnoid space in six patients, and clumping of cauda equina nerve roots in six patients. Contrast-enhanced studies were available in 20 patients. Meningeal enhancement was seen in 16 (80%) of 20 patients, and nerve root enhancement was seen in six (30%) patients. Cord enhancement was seen in four (20%) of 20 patients. Enhancement was observed along the surface of the cord in two of these patients, whereas the other two patients showed central enhancement. Associated findings were tubercular spondylitis in two patients, basal exudate in eight patients, and intracranial granulomas in five patients. Conclusion: MR imaging revealed several pathologic changes that occur in patients with tubercular spinal arachnoiditis and, hence, may play an important role in the diagnosis of this entity.",meningitis
"At present, both migraine and tension-type headaches in children are believed to be chronic primary headaches. Meningeal signs in both cases are ignored or not examined, and the neurologic status is considered normal. This is the first study that focuses on meningeal signs in children with chronic headaches. The study population comprised 1738 patients aged 5 to 17 years who were examined in an outpatient neurologic clinic over a 6-year period. Particular attention was paid to examination of meningeal signs, including nuchal rigidity, Kernig's sign, Brudzinski's three signs (upper, middle, and lower), the ""tripod"" sign, and Guillain's and facial signs; the presence of these signs was regarded as meningismus syndrome. Some meningeal signs were found in 12% of 1007 children suffering from migraine, whereas 97% of 731 children with tension-type headaches had the whole set of meningeal signs. This suggested that meningismus is the major clinical syndrome in chronic tension-type headaches in children and adolescents. Chronic mild sterile (possibly autoimmune) inflammation of meninges (dura mater) can be caused by a preceding infection, as well as minor trauma of the head and/or back. Prolonged rest in a recumbent position usually resulted in relief or complete disappearance of both headache and meningeal signs. Monitoring of the meningeal signs is helpful for evaluation of the patient's condition in the course of treatment.",meningitis

"A clinicomorphological study of 660 patients with acute traumatic intracranial hematomas has shown that pneummonia develops in 56% of cases, intracranial complications (purulent meningitis) in 14%.Pyoinflammatory complications were 1.5-1.7 times less common in small-sized hematomas, their total rate and the rate of pneumonias was twice higher in left cerebral hemispheric lesion. On the contrary, intracranial complications were twice more common in right cerebral hemispheric lesion. The structural bases of the regional meningeal immunity system were as follows: the pathways of blood and spinal fluid circulation and dural arachnoidal intercellular fluid; cellular cooperation of the meninx and tissue of the brain; the network of lymph vessels of the dura mater encephali and adventitia of large blood vessels and middle and inferior jugular (regional) lymph nodes. Morphodunctional changes in the local meningeal immunity system in patients with hematomas point to the development of secondary immunodeficiency. Inclusion of regional immunotherapy with T-activin into multimodality treatment decreases the incidence of extra- and intracranial pyoinflammatory complications and mortality.",meningitis
"Rosai-Dorfman disease is an idiopathic histiocytic proliferative disorder characterized by sinus histiocytosis and massive lymphadenopathy. Extranodal involvement has also been reported. We report the case of a 57-year-old woman presenting with seizures, focal motor deficits, and leptomeningeal enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging. Meningeal biopsy revealed Rosai-Dorfman disease. Sinus histiocytosis may mimic meningeal disease, and Rosai-Dorfman disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of dural-based masses with diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement.",meningitis
"The use of lumbar puncture (LP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in the routine, initial evaluation of patients with dementia continues to be questioned. This is especially true in the investigation of infectious causes of dementia. To explore this question further, the authors performed a retrospective analysis of 672 hospitalized patients specifically evaluated for dementia. LP and CSF analysis were performed on 402 patients (60 per cent); routine bacteriologic, acid-fast, and fungal cultures were also obtained for 333 of these patients. Most patients were white (64 per cent) and male (63 per cent), their mean age being 66 +/- 11 years. Four patients were diagnosed as having meningitis--two with Cryptococcus neoformans, one with apparent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and one with coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. These patients were characterized by a subacute change in mental status, fever or meningismus, and CSF pleocytosis with abnormal CSF chemistries. None of the patients were found to have newly diagnosed neurosyphilis. The authors conclude that LP and CSF analysis should not be part of the routine evaluation of patients with dementia and should be performed only in the presence of such indications as a subacute duration of dementia, fever, and signs of meningeal irritation.",meningitis
"SURGIFOAM (Absorbable Gelatin Sponge, USP), a new absorbable hemostatic sponge, GELFOAM (Absorbable Gelatin Sponge, USP) or Avitene (microfibrillar collagen hemostat) were evaluated in a three-month tissue reaction and absorption study in rabbits. Bilateral craniotomy was followed by subdural implantation of each hemostatic device. A sham control group was treated in a similar way except that no material was implanted. Implantation of these hemostatic devices for 15, 43, or 92 days did not result in any deaths or clinical neurobehavioral abnormalities, changes in cerebrospinal fluid, or significant macroscopic observations at necropsy. The tissue reaction to SURGIFOAM sponge was characterized by transient granulomatous inflammation that was slightly less intense than that observed for GELFOAM sponge which correlated to slightly longer absorption. In contrast, the tissue reaction to Avitene hemostat was characterized by moderate to marked granulomatous inflammation with an acute inflammatory component indicating a greater degree of tissue irritancy. Sequelae of this reaction were still observed at 92 days post-implantation. The tissue reaction in humans to SURGIFOAM sponge used as a hemostatic agent for neurologic surgical procedures is expected to be comparable to that observed with GELFOAM sponge, resulting in no significant adverse reactions for patients. This animal model was useful to assess the tissue reaction and absorption of biomaterials implanted in contact with the central nervous system, and it was able to differentiate between materials of biologic origin.",meningitis
"Concentrations of unconjugated pteridines (neopterin, monapterin, biopterin, pterin) were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 310 patients, using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPCL) method. Our cohort included 209 controls (C), 15 patients with meningism (M), 22 with viral meningitis (VM), 17 with bacterial meningitis (BM), 9 with herpetic meningoencephalitis (HME), 2 with tuberculous meningoencephalitis (TME) and 36 with peripheral systemic infections (PI). These measurements, expressed as nmol/litre, showed a gradation of neopterin concentrations according to the type of infection: 20.1 + 6.5 in group C; 46.9 +/- 29.9 in group PI; 274.3 +/- 231.7 in group VM; 699.2 +/- 711.2 in group BM, 1,101.9 +/- 1,107.9 in group HME and 1,169 +/- 1,171.9 in group TME. There was no such gradation with biopterin. Comparisons of means showed that total concentrations in the pathology groups were very different from those observed in controls and in the neuromeningeal infections of the PI group. There was no correlation between the number of lymphocytes and the concentrations of neopterin or biopterin in the CSF. It is concluded that the concentration of neopterin in the CSF is a sensitive but little specific marker of infection, independent of CSF cellular reaction. Measuring this concentration makes it possible: 1) to evaluate the status of immune defences; 2) to predict that a meningitis will become chronic, and 3) to detect a possible parenchymal participation in a meningeal infection.",meningitis
"The December 2002 COM. A 19-year-old healthy male fell into stagnant water of the intercostal waterway (salt water of South Florida), following a jet ski accident. He sustained minor superficial injuries but engulfed significant quantities of water and sediment. A few days later he developed bifrontal headaches, vomiting, a stiff neck and a temperature of 102 degrees F. A CT scan on admission without contrast was negative. The CSF had markedly elevated white count but bacterial and fungal cultures were negative. He became progressively lethargic. On the fifth day he developed seizure activity. He expired the next day despite antibiotics. Gross examination of the brain at autopsy revealed edema, cerebellar tonsillar herniation and purulent meningitis. Microscopic examination revealed a massive leptomeningeal inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and numerous histiocyte-like cells. The inflammatory infiltrate extended into the cerebral parenchyma in numerous areas also involving the cerebellum, brainstem and ventricular system. Given the exposure to stagnant water (later confirmed to be a man-made fresh water lake), and the numerous histiocytic-like cells, suspicion for an amebic etiology of the disease process was raised and the CDC identified the ameba as Naegleria Fowleri. Infection by Naegleria Fowleri, a free-living ameba, occurs after exposure to polluted water in man-made fresh water lakes, ponds, swimming pools, particularly during the warm weather months when the thermophilic ameba grows well. The pathologic substrate of the infection is an acute hemorrhagic, necrotizing meningo-encephalitis mainly at the base of the brain, brainstem and cerebellum occurring in young, healthy individuals.",meningitis
"Nuchal rigidity, which may be a sign of meningitis, was found in 35 per cent of geriatric patients on acute-care and rehabilitation wards and in 13 per cent of younger patients on an acute-care ward. It was significantly associated with cerebrovascular disease, confusion, abnormal plantar responses, and primitive reflexes. Elderly patients who have nuchal rigidity with no history of neurologic or cognitive disorders should be investigated for meningitis.",meningitis
Background and purpose: The below publication presents a case of a 51-year-old patient with cervical discopathy of unusual clinical course. Case report: The symptoms of the disease suddenly became aggravated and took a form of meningeal syndrome without inflammation of cerebrospinal fluid. The authors emphasize the symptomatology and diagnostic difficulties connected to unusual clinical course of cervical discopathy at the level of VC3/VC4. Discussion: Both medical and neurosurgical approaches to clinical history of cervical discopathic patient were presented in details. The patient underwent anterior cervical interbody fusion and the operative procedure was very effective for a few years up till now.,meningitis
"To evaluate the potential diagnostic value of the ferritin concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), measurements were performed with an immunoradiometric assay in 23 control patients and in 65 patients with various neurologic disorders. The geometric mean ferritin level of 3.5 micrograms/L in controls was approximately 10% of the level in normal serum with an upper cutoff level of 10 micrograms/L. Only modest elevations in CSF ferritin concentration were observed in patients with viral meningitis and in those with various non-infectious neurologic disorders. On the other hand, marked elevations ranging between 27 and 322 micrograms/L (geometric mean, 90 micrograms/L) were observed in patients with bacterial or fungal meningitis. Results of the study indicate that CSF ferritin levels are a valuable adjunct in the early evaluation of patients presenting with meningism.",meningitis
"We report three patients with chronic headaches and optic neuropathy due to widespread meningeal thickening shown on enhanced MRI; all had biopsy-proven intracranial pachymeningitis (fibrosclerosis of the meninges). Two patients had bilateral optic neuropathy, elevated CSF protein, and polyclonal serum hypergammaglobulinemia. They developed temporal lobe cortical necrosis or sagittal sinus thrombosis, presumably due to compromised dural venous drainage from extensive meningeal fibrosis. The other patient had multiple cranial nerve palsies and unilateral optic neuropathy with normal CSF. Corticosteroid therapy improved visual function in all three patients, although all had persisting visual deficits. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI was essential in identifying meningeal inflammation and locating suitable biopsy sites.",meningitis
"We report a case of rheumatoid pachymeningitis involving the posterior fossa. A 71-year-old woman presented with headache, vertigo and dizziness. MRI demonstrated hypertrophic masses in the meninges of the left cerebellar tentorium, cerebellopontine angle and the fourth ventricle. Six months of treatment with betamethasone, prednisolone and azathioprine improved the patient's neurological status. Because an inappropriate immune process and systemic immune disease may cause idiopathic pachymeningitis, the performance of immunological studies for idiopathic cases is mandatory.",meningitis
Purpose: To investigate the association between central nervous system (CNS) inflammation at disease onset and the appearance of sunset glow fundus (SGF) in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Charts of 102 patients with VKH disease followed from from initial onset were reviewed. The frequency of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and the number of cells in the CSF were compared among the patients who eventually developed SGF and the patients who had not developed SGF as of final follow-up. Results: SGF was observed in 69 (67.6%) of 102 patients. The frequency of CSF pleocytosis was 77 (82.7%) of 93 patients examined. The frequency of CSF pleocytosis and the number of cells in CSF were significantly higher in patients who eventually developed SGF (both P = .0029). Conclusions: Severe inflammatory response in CNS sites at disease onset may influence the development of SGF in VKH disease.,meningitis
"The MR appearance of normal and pathological meninges was studied in 23 patients. Amongst twelve normals, T1-weighted images demonstrated the meninges as slightly hyperintense density structures (compared with CSF) which increased in signal intensity somewhat after the administration of gadolinium-DTPA. On T2-weighted images, the subarachnoid space and meninges were isointense. In eleven patients with inflammatory disease or tumourous infiltration of the meninges, abnormal findings were evident in the unenhanced images as well as after administration of gadolinium-DTPA. Compared with CT, MR proved greatly superior in the diagnosis of meningeal abnormalities.",meningitis
"Background: The authors assessed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in patients with carcinomatous meningitis using technetium-99m-DTPA (Tc-99) ventriculography to determine the frequency of flow abnormalities, their reversibility with treatment, and the implications for successful therapy and survival. Methods: Technetium-99m-DTPA flow studies were performed in 31 patients after placement of Ommaya reservoirs (Baxter, McGaw Park, IL). Two millicuries of Tc-99 were injected into the reservoir. Planar images of the head and entire spine were obtained after 10 and 30 minutes and after 1, 4, 6, and 24 hours. Follow-up studies were performed for 12 patients whose initial studies were abnormal or who developed complications of therapy. Results: In 19 of the 31 patients (61%), ventricular-outlet, spinal, or convexity blocks were identified. In 11 of these 19 patients, focal radiotherapy to the site of the block restored normal flow. Survival among patients with initially normal, abnormal but correctable, and abnormal but uncorrectable CSF flow differed significantly (6.9, 13.0, and 0.7 months respectively; P < 0.001). Some patients who were treated intrathecally despite abnormal CSF flow experienced drug-related toxicity. Conclusions: Cerebrospinal fluid-flow blocks are common in patients with carcinomatous meningitis and may occur at the skull base, in the spinal canal, and over the convexities. These flow abnormalities often can be corrected with appropriately directed radiotherapy. If untreated, CSF tumor progression (protected site effect), neurotoxicity (high concentration effect), and systemic toxicity (reservoir effect) can occur, resulting in shortened survival and treatment-related morbidity. Therefore, intrathecal chemotherapy should be preceded by a radionuclide flow study and should be delayed if abnormal flow is documented until appropriate radiotherapy reestablishes normal flow.",meningitis
A case of carcinomatous meningitis clinically suggesting an inflammatory process is described. The patient died unexpectedly of an intercurrent cause and the neuropathological examination allowed to recognize a early stage of carcinomatous infiltration of meninges.,meningitis
"Although tuberculosis is an uncommon cause of spinal arachnoiditis, it needs to be differentiated from other causes of arachnoiditis because it is a treatable disease. Myelography, which is the imaging modality of choice for the chronic adhesive stage of tuberculous arachnoiditis, usually reveals irregularity of the thecal sac, nodularity and thickening of nerve roots, clumping of roots to each other or to the thecal sac, or CSF block. Recently Gd-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid enhanced MRI has been found to be useful for the active phase of tuberculous infection, effectively demonstrating abnormally thickened and enhancing meninges, intra- and extramedullary tuberculous nodules, and spinal cord changes. We present the MRI features in a case of acute tuberculous arachnoiditis.",meningitis
"MR imaging was used to investigate normal and abnormal meningeal enhancement, with an emphasis on meningeal carcinomatosis. Three groups of patients were studied on a 1.5-T system. In group 1, the normal meninges were examined in 20 patients and were found to show fine linear enhancement in short segments, especially in a parasagittal distribution. In group 2, all gadolinium-enhanced head scans were reviewed retrospectively. Abnormal meningeal enhancement was detected in 52 patients. In some of these, the enhancement was associated with pathologic conditions of the meninges, including leptomeningeal tumor and meningeal infections and other inflammatory conditions; in others the enhancement was adjacent to subdural hematomas, subacute infarcts, and skull lesions, such as metastases or postoperative defects. In group 3, 30 cases of meningeal carcinomatosis were studied prospectively. Enhancement was seen in approximately two-thirds of cases and usually was quite diffuse and applied to the inner table of the skull. Frank nodules were seen less often. Contrast-enhanced CT was equal to MR in the detection of nodules but was nearly always unable to show diffuse meningeal enhancement against the inner table of the skull. Contrast-enhanced MR was more sensitive than contrast-enhanced CT in the examination of normal and abnormal meninges. Abnormal findings, such as meningeal carcinomatosis, were demonstrated more often by MR than by CT.",meningitis
"Aztreonam was administered as a single, 2-g intravenous dose to 25 patients with noninflamed meninges and to 9 patients with inflamed meninges. It was well tolerated and was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid at the initial sampling period at 1 h after the end of infusion. Aztreonam levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with inflamed meninges were four times higher than those recorded for the same time period in patients with noninflamed meninges. Aztreonam concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of normal and inflamed meninges exceeded the inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations for most gram-negative bacteria. Thus, a multiple-dose treatment regimen with 2-g intravenous doses every 6 h appears to be appropriate for clinical trials of aztreonam for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis which is caused by susceptible organisms.",meningitis
"A patient with surgical and neuropathologically confirmed subdural sarcoid granuloma was evaluated using angiography, contrast-enhanced CT and MR. MR images were obtained on a superconducting magnet with T1, intermediate and multi-echo T2 weighted sequences. Review of the 2 prior cases of subdural sarcoid granuloma from the literature evaluated with MR confirm the variable nature of signal intensities of the lesion. MR was most useful in anatomically evaluating the lesion and planning neurosurgical intervention but both CT and MR alone, in this case, did not definitely obviate the other differential diagnosis including meningioma en-plaque, lymphoma, or metastasis.",meningitis
"The penetration of rifampicin into CSF was studied in seven patients who had undergone external ventriculostomy for occlusive hydrocephalus without major disturbance of the blood-CSF barrier. After the first dose of rifampicin 600 mg i.v. over 3 h, blood and CSF concentrations were determined serially by HPLC. Peak CSF concentrations obtained 0-8 h (median = 1 h) after the end of the infusion ranged from 0.57 to 1.24 mg/L (median = 0.73 mg/L). Elimination from CSF was slower than from serum (T1/2 beta CSF: 9.1-21.0 h (median = 14.5 h, n = 5); T1/2 beta serum: 2.2-5.8 h (median = 3.6 h, n = 7)). Based on the ratios of the areas under the concentration-time curves in CSF and serum, the overall penetration of rifampicin into CSF was 0.13-0.42 (median = 0.22). These results demonstrate effective CSF penetration and favourable pharmacokinetics of rifampicin in the absence of meningeal inflammation. They support the use of rifampicin as part of a combination therapy not only for tuberculosis of the central nervous system (CNS), but also for staphylococcal and listerial infections of the CNS in which there may be little meningeal inflammation.",meningitis
"We studied 40 consecutive patients clinically suspected of having meningeal disease, in whom both Gd-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) examinations and CSF or surgical pathologic samples were obtained. The MR examinations were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of abnormal meningeal enhancement, as well as pattern and site of enhancement. The MR findings correctly correlated with pathology results in 15 of 19 patients with suspected tumor involvement (including one true negative) and in 18 of 21 patients with suspected inflammatory meningeal conditions (including 2 true negatives). Pial enhancement was demonstrated in 62% (10 of 16) of patients with meningitis and in 29% (4 of 14) of patients with meningeal neoplastic involvement. A diffuse meningeal distribution was commonly present with inflammatory conditions (69%, 11 of 16). A nodular appearance was seen in two patients with tumor involvement of the meninges as well as in a single case of sarcoidosis but was not seen with infectious meningitis. Our data suggest that Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging is sensitive to the presence of meningeal pathology but is nonspecific as to disease entity. Recognition of certain MR patterns in conjunction with clinical presentation may improve diagnosis and management of patients with suspected meningeal disease.",meningitis
"In a group of 20 postcraniotomy patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging performed with gadopentetate dimeglumine, 16 (80%) had nonneoplastic meningeal enhancement. This was seen as either enhancement of a local dural membrane or generalized meningeal enhancement. In a control group of 23 patients, only three (13%) had similar findings. The authors believe that postcraniotomy meningeal enhancement is most likely the result of a local inflammatory process or a diffuse chemical arachnoiditis caused by bleeding into the subarachnoid space at the time of surgery. The finding does not necessarily indicate leptomeningeal tumor spread or infection.",meningitis
"Sixty-nine children were identified and evaluable. Forty-one (60%) presented with hypotension and/or abnormal neurological signs. In 34 (49%) a petechial rash was present on admission. Of note, 13 (19%) had a non-petechial rash, and rash was absent in 19 (28%). Twenty-one (30%) presented with meningism or meningitis. In one child the illness was so mild that the child was discharged prior to making a diagnosis. Five children died (7%). Sixty-three cases (91%) were diagnosed by blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture; these investigations remain the mainstay of diagnosis.",meningitis
"Introduction: Horton's disease is the most common vasculitis of elder people. Several neurological complications are reported, but pachymeningitis is exceptional. Observation: A 71-year-old patient who presented headache, hyperesthesia of the scalp, weight loss with a biological inflammatory syndrome and meningeal thickening on MRI. The diagnosis of pachymeningitis related to Horton's disease was retained. The patient was treated by corticosteroids with a good clinical, biological and radiological course after 22 months. Conclusion: Horton's disease is a potential diagnosis in elderly persons with pachymeningitis and inflammatory syndrome.",meningitis
A patient on chronic haemodialysis because of renal failure developed progressive visual field loss and eventual blindness. A postmortem examination indicated that the blindness was caused by granulomatous thickening of the pachymeninges which constricted the optic nerves as they passed through the optic foramina. Exhaustive bacteriological and histopathological studies failed to identify a specific cause for this hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis.,meningitis
"The parietal dura mater encephali of the rat was shown by immunohistochemistry to be densely innervated by calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactive nerve fibers spreading around the medial meningeal artery and its branches. Electrical stimulation of the dural surface (10-20 V, 5-10 Hz, 10-30 min) caused a depletion of CGRP-immunopositive fibers, suggesting a release of CGRP. The dural blood flow around branches of the medial meningeal artery was also monitored with a laser Doppler flowmeter. Short periods (30 s) of electrical stimulation with parameters that presumably released CGRP form nerve fibers caused a repeatable and constant increase of the blood flow for 1-2 min. This evoked increase could dose dependently be inhibited by topical application of the CGRP antagonist hCGRP8-37. Accordingly, administration of hCGRP increased the basal blood flow. We conclude that stimulation of trigeminal afferents innervating the dura mater releases CGRP from peptidergic afferent terminals, thereby causing vasodilatation and increasing the meningeal blood flow, an important element of neurogenic inflammation.",meningitis
"Two patients with inflammatory meningeal masses were studied. Lesions in both patients showed varying proportions of meningothelial and inflammatory components. The non-neoplastic nature of the inflammation was confirmed in one case by lymphocyte surface marker study, which showed T and B cells in one to four ratio, and by immunohistochemistry, which revealed polyclonal plasma cells. The abundant histiocytes contained muramidase and often enclosed intact lymphocytes or plasma cells within their cytoplasm, i.e., emperipolesis. Their surfaces bore slender interdigitating pseudopodia, intercellular junctions, and subplasmalemmal linear densities. The derivation of these histiocytes is uncertain: mononuclear phagocytes, meningothelial cells, and multipotential meningeal cells are all possible progenitors. A comparison with eleven similar reported cases reveals a tendency for inflammatory meningeal masses to occur in the young, as well as a predilection for posterior fossa involvement. They resemble the extranodal lesions of sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, as well as plasma cell granulomas or inflammatory pseudotumors of lung and other tissues. However, it is possible that these lesions represent a variant of meningioma in which an unusual immunological response has been evoked.",meningitis
"We report the clinical and neuroradiological features of cerebral rheumatoid pachymeningitis with 1 year follow-up in two patients. MRI of the head enabled noninvasive diagnosis of both the meningeal abnormality and its complications, consisting of hypertensive hydrocephalus and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, respectively. Dural sinus thrombosis, very uncommon in rheumatoid arthritis, was confirmed by phase-contrast MRA. Worsening of the pachymeningitis at follow-up was observed in both patients despite regression or stability of the clinical picture and long-term therapy.",meningitis
"A 53-year-old man with meningeal cryptococcosis lasting 9 years is reported. Microscopic examination demonstrated presence of extensive leptomeningeal fibrosis with presence of single or aggregated cryptococci varying in size. In the calcified capsules of the organisms presence of calcium, silicon, magnesium, phosphorus and copper was demonstrated.",meningitis
In 10 patients with various forms of epilepsy the effect of air insufflation into the subarachnoidal space on the number of immunocompetent cells in the cerebrospinal liquor and the peripheral blood was studied. A sharp rise of the percentage of the T- and B-lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal liquor was noted as a result of the insufflation. Examinations of the blood before the insufflation and in the presence of the pronounced post-insufflation meningeal syndrome did not reveal any distinct regularity. A direct relationship between the liquor immune reaction and the intensity of the post-insufflation meningeal syndrome was noted.,meningitis
"A case of fatal strongyloidiasis associated with pyogenic meningitis in an adult male African is reported. Strongyloides larvae were present in the purulent exudate in the the meninges, an observation not, to the authors knowledge, hitherto reported in man. Fatal strongyloidiasis due to autoinfection has been reported by several authors and De Paula (1962) reviewed the literature in 40 cases and added 10 others which he had studied. In Uganda fatal cases have been reported by Craven et al. (1971) and Poltera (1974). Although in some cases of fatal strongyloidiasis there was associated pyogenic meningitis (BROWN & PERNA, 1958; WILSON & THOMPSON, 1964; BASSAN-TREMINGER & EL-LANSHAR, 1968) we have not found in the literature any case in which Strongyloides stercoralis larvae or adult worms were found in the brain or meninges. We are, therefore, now reporting a case of fatal strongyloidiasis with pyogenic meningitis in which S. stercoralis larvae were present in the subarachnoid space.",meningitis
"A 45-year-old woman developed signs of meningeal irritation after myelography with iohexol. Her condition improved very quickly (after antibiotic treatment). Rapid improvement, absence of pathogenic organisms in the pre-treatment CSF culture, the level of CSF pleocytosis and protein were in favor of chemical meningitis.",meningitis
"A highly sensitive and specific immunoradiometric assay, based upon a monoclonal antibody, was used to measure interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with central nervous system infections and in controls with non-infectious neurological disorders. IFN-alpha was detected in all 21 patients with viral meningitis but in only one of four patients with non-viral aseptic meningitis. It was also present in the CSF of three of four patients with herpes encephalitis and five of seven patients with acute bacterial meningitis. By contrast, IFN-alpha was present in the CSF in low concentrations in only five (7%) of 71 neurological controls. This rapid test is positive in viral meningitis and may help in distinguishing viral infection from other causes of aseptic meningitis. It is usually negative in non-infective disorders but will not distinguish between viral and bacterial infections.",meningitis
"Introduction: Spinal cord compression due to meningeal thickening is a rare occurrence in shunted patients. Because of the long delay to clinical onset, this complication has not been identified as yet. Aims: We report on nine cases of shunt-related progressive myelopathy due to meningeal thickening (SPMMT). Materials and methods: We reviewed our database of shunted children, for cases having developed progressive tetraparesis due to cervical meningeal thickening. Results: We identified nine observations of SPMMT, eight of these with hydrocephalus due to neonatal meningitis; the last case had Dandy-Walker malformation shunted at birth and suffered postoperative meningitis. The age of clinical onset of myelopathy was between 6 and 20 years (median 12.8). All patients presented with slowly progressive walking difficulties with falls and no spinal pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed typically a thickened dura mater with collapse of the arachnoid space, compensatory expansion of the epidural fat, and T2 hyperintensity in the spinal cord. We operated on seven patients for surgical decompression and arachnoidolysis: One died postoperatively because of shunt malfunction, and two others died later of complications of tetraplegia. Three patients were aggravated after surgery, three experienced partial improvement, but one of these subsequently deteriorated again. Conclusion: SPMMT appears to be a novel and well-defined clinical and pathological entity; its pathological and radiological features are stereotyped; however, the diagnosis is delayed because of the slow pace of the disease. Although surgical decompression may be the only option, its results were poor in our experience; earlier surgery might improve this grim prognosis.",meningitis
"We report the case of a meningeal inflammatory pseudotumour occurring in a 23-year-old male presenting with focal seizures and headaches. Brain imaging techniques showed a 3.5 cm left parietal meningeal tumour. Histology of the surgical specimen showed a dense lymphoid infiltrate permeating the dura mater and leptomeninges, consisting of a predominant polyclonal B cell population as confirmed by immunophenotyping and genotyping. Cultures of serum, CSF, and surgical specimen were negative and there was no serological evidence of a systemic dysimmune disease. The postoperative course was complicated by an episode of brain oedema resolving under steroid therapy. The patient, free from all medication, is asymptomatic at 3 years of follow-up. We discuss previously published cases and the nosology of intracranial inflammatory pseudotumours.",meningitis
"A 52-year-old woman presented with a clinical picture consistent with bacterial meningitis 3 years after functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula was made clinically, and the site of the fistula was confirmed using magnetic resonance cisternography. The utilization of this technique in the diagnosis of CSF disorders is gaining popularity. Its usefulness in the context of other imaging modalities is discussed.",meningitis
"A case of spontaneous pneumocephalus with progression to tension pneumocephalus is presented. It is unique because it occurred spontaneously via a sellar defect 5 years after resection and irradiation of a pituitary adenoma, without tumor recurrence. Computed tomography clarified the extent of the pneumocephalus and its progression to tension pneumocephalus.",meningitis

A case is reported in which chemical meningism occurred after lumbar facet joint block with methylprednisolone acetate and bupivacaine. This complication was probably due to inadvertent dural puncture. The use of steroids in facet joint injections is questioned.,meningitis
"The fluorescence method of Blume et al. was found to be useful for identification and morphological evaluation of lysosomes in cerebrospinal fluid cells. The investigations were carried out in 49 patients with viral and bacterial meningitis or meningismus. It was demonstrated that the CSF cells in most patients with purulent meningitis contained no fluorescent granules in an early stage of the disease before introduction of antibacterial therapy. These granules were found in CSF cells in cases of leptospirosis, viral meningitis and meningismus of various aetiology in acute stage of the disease and even in convalescence, and in purulent meningitis in convalescence. In bacterial meningitis large lysosomal granules were observed, and in viral meningitis these granules were small. The method visualizes easily bacteria (meningococci and pneumococci) in the cerebrospinal fluid.",meningitis
"For a five year period 235 patients with a malignant lymphoma were studied in clinical conditions. In 20 of them (8.9%) the central nervous system was affected: 13 patients showed signs of spinal cord compression, 5 patients were with meningosis and 2 patients had cerebral infiltrations. The meningeal affection was found in patients presenting certain risk factors: young age, packages of lymph nodes localized retroperitoneally, lymphomas with a high degree of malignancy, extranodal localization. The patients with meningosis have a short longevity which implies meningeal prophylaxis in the risk groups. The spinal cord compression as a complication of the lymphoma does not determine the prognosis. The prognosis is related to the spread of the lymphoma. The knowledge of the early manifestations of these complications and the timely treatment lead to a favourable result. A very good therapeutic result can be achieved by the combined treatment--polychemotherapy and intrathecal administration of a cytostatic (cyclophosphamide and/or methotrexate).",meningitis
"A four - month old boy with Salmonella Typhimurium meningitis is presented. This patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of staphylococcal pneumonia, pyo-pneumothorax, cardiac failure and anemia. He has been treated for 18 days and he was discharged in good condition. Two days after discharge patient was readmitted with a fever, vomiting and feeding problem. In physical examination, stiff neck and bulging of the fontanel were remarkable. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has revealed meningitis and cultures of blood and CSF specimens were positive for S. typhimurium. It was sensitive only to trimethoprim sulphamethoxazole and netilmicin. Trimethoprim sulphamethoxazole (IM) and netilmicin (IV) were given. At the fifth day of this treatment patient expired. Postmortem examination has revealed the same agent in both meninges tissue and CSF cultures.",meningitis
"A hundred and twelve autopsy reports made in adults who died in the past 50 years (1948 to 1998) are analyzed. The analysis revealed a significant pathomorphosis of tuberculosis of the meninges and CNS occurred in the years studied. There was a reversion of severe forms of generalized tuberculosis, a rise in the incidence of tuberculous meningitis and younger age of patients dying from this disease.",meningitis
"Behçet's disease is a multisystem disease that involves the central nervous system up to half of cases. Presentation with neurologic symptoms occurs in 5% of cases and cerebral venous thrombosis is one of its major manifestations. A feature not previously reported is progressive meningeal thickening with involvement of both optic nerves. We report a patient with cerebral venous thrombosis, meningeal thickening and contrast enhancement on MRI. This patient had two other unusual features: positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and later development of central diabetes insipidus.",meningitis
"Owing to improved therapy and lengthened life span, the incidence of neuromeningeal involvement in leukemia is increasing. Careful examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is important for an early diagnosis. Among the available techniques, the use of cytocentrifugation enables us to demonstrate central nervous system leukemia even if the white blood cell count in the CSF is under 10/cu mm. We describe the results obtained by examining 631 CSF samples from 87 patients affected by acute leukemia; central nervous system luekemia was found in 22.7% of the patients suffering from acute lymphocytic leukemia and in 6.4% of those with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), but this ratio is higher in ANLL compared with the survival as measured in months (a ratio of 2.0 in ANLL compared with 0.50 in acute lymphocytic leukemia). A ""leukemic"" CSF was found in 51.5% of prophylactically treated patients and in 73.1% of the untreated ones.",meningitis
"Eight patients who had sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) associated with cryptococcal meningitis were studied. After a minimum 3-year follow-up, one had died. Among the seven survivors, three had improved, two stabilized, and two progressed. Predictive factors included visual disturbance, meningeal enhancements on MRI, and a CSF cryptococcal antigen titer of >1:1,024. SNHL accounted for 30.8% (8/26) of cryptococcal meningitis patients in our study.",meningitis
"This is a descriptive analysis of the angiographic characteristics of leptomeningeal infections in 36 children and a correlation of these angiographic observations with anatomopathologic changes. Vascular, meningeal and parenchymal changes are described and discussed. In the normal situation, tracer protein particles injected into the subarachnoid space perfuse easily through the extracellular spaces but stop at the outer continuous arachnoidal layer. The parenchymal layer, pia-arachnoid, on the other hand, consists of a uni or pluricellular layer which is regularly crossed by tracer particles. Though the internal carotid, vertebral and basilar arteries have some anatomical characteristics: thinner tunica media and adventitia, the absence of vasa vasorum and the presence of a fluid cushion (CSF) in which they are bathed. The most striking angiographic observation in leptomeningitis is the transmural extravasation of the contrast meding 'halo' formation. Long after the cerebral circulation time, one may identify contrast media 'pooling' within the cisterns and sulci.",meningitis
This report describes the clinical course and pathological findings in a four-year-old male cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) which succumbed to fulminant pneumococcal meningitis.

"Purpose: We sought to characterize and compare the histopathologic and clinical changes elicited by subdural and depth electrodes in subjects undergoing epilepsy surgery evaluation. Methods: A retrospective review of clinical records, imaging and histopathologic studies of epilepsy surgery cases requiring subdural strips and depth electrodes for localization of epileptogenic tissue was performed between 1993 and 1999. Forty-nine subjects had a combination of subdural and depth, whereas 10 had depth electrodes only. Histopathologic changes were classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the density, extent, and composition of the inflammatory infiltrate. Results: Subdural electrodes induced a clinical picture of transient aseptic meningitis; histopathologically, the infiltrates were moderate in degree in the majority (73%) and severe in the remainder (27%), with T cells and eosinophils infiltrating the cortex and arteriolar walls (hypersensitivity-type response). Depth electrodes alone caused minimal or no symptoms of meningeal irritation; the cellular response elicited by these electrodes was mild in five and moderate in the remaining five cases; severe inflammation was not observed in this group. Although the proportion of small clinically silent hematomas was larger in cases with depth (five of 59) compared with subdural electrodes (one of 49), microhemorrhages were considerably more numerous with subdural than with depth electrodes. Conclusions: These results suggest that the spectrum of brain responses to foreign bodies is wide, ranging from self-limited physiologic to hypersensitivity-type reactions of varying severity. Subdural strips elicited more intense inflammation than did depth electrodes. The histopathologic extent of the reaction to either type of electrodes could not be precisely defined because of the retrospective nature of this study. History of allergy to latex or previous craniotomies are probable risk factors for the hypersensitivity-type reaction. Surgical outcome, excellent in the majority, was independent of the severity or type of inflammation, and there have not been neurologic or systemic sequelae.",meningitis
"Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of fosfomycin were evaluated in 45 patients. Mean serum concentration was 260.1 mg/l at 15 min postinfusion in 35 patients receiving a 5 g bolus dose, and 440 mg/l in five patients receiving a 10 g bolus dose. Mean distribution volume was 18.5 l (5 g dose), the total clearance was 118.8 ml/min, half-life was nearly 2 h, and the determined AUC were 420.95 mg/l.h (5 g dose) and 423.57 mg/l.h (10 g dose). The average peaks at 360 min in CSF reached 11.6 mg/l (5 g dose) and 17.7 mg/l (10 g dose). The CSF/serum ratio was 9.24% (5 g dose), and 13.81% (10 g dose). The CSF levels were not below 30 mg/l from the second day on in patients receiving 3 X 5 g fosfomycin per day. Meningeal inflammation increased the CSF concentrations from 30 mg/l at 6 h up to 150 mg/l at 120 h in the saturation phase, e. g., up to 300% more in comparison to non-inflamed meninges.",meningitis
"A 56-year-old female presented with idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis manifesting as headache, hypopituitarism, and diabetes insipidus, mimicking lymphocytic hypophysitis. Five months later, she complained of double vision and unusual right facial sensation. The diagnosis was based on magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and meningeal biopsy via transsphenoidal surgery, and exclusion of other know causes of pachymeningitis. Despite initial response to steroid treatment, her symptoms recurred repeatedly and she became steroid-dependent. Repetition of short-term steroid pulse therapy restrained the deterioration of her condition. The clinical presentation of idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is variable, and it may develop with signs of adjacent tissue involvement. Resultant secondary hypophysitis must be differentiated from lymphocytic hypophysitis. Initial steroid therapy is effective in improving symptoms, but should be carefully considered since the natural course of this disease seems to be self-limited.",meningitis
"Objective: To evaluate leptomeningeal and subpial inflammatory responses of experimental Staphylococcus aureus bacteriemia following intraperitoneal and intravenous applications and to compare the inflammatory reactions in different regions of central nervous system. Material and methods: Forty anesthetized rats were divided into four groups equal in number. The rats in group-I were given 1 ml suspension of Staphylococcus aureus intraperitoneally. Group-II was the control group of group I; it was administrated 1 ml 0.9% NaCl in water intraperitoneally. The rats in group-III were given the same amount of bacteria intravenously. Group IV was the control group of the group-III; it was administrated 1 ml 0.9% NaCl solution intravenously. The rats were sacrificed on the 21st day. Inflammatory changes of different regions of the central nervous system were examined under transmission electron microscopy. Statistical analysis was done by using variance analysis, Bonferroni, Tamhane post hoc, Student's t and univariate tests. Results: Thoracic and occipital regions were the most vulnerable zones. Increasing of collagen tissue was the most detected inflammatory change. Conclusion: This experimental model can be used for inducing subpial and leptomeningeal inflammations and it may be developed for investigations of pathogenesis of leptomeningitis during systemic infections.",meningitis
"The brains from 10 nine-banded armadillos with lepromatous leprosy were studied histopathologically. All of them showed evidence of lepromatous meningitis.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of meningoencephalitis in a lepromatous nine-banded armadillo.",meningitis
"We here report an autopsy case of meningovascular neurosyphilis associated with Fischer's plaques, a demyelinating lesion which is typical of the late stage general paresis. A Japanese male who was 59 years old at the time of death, developed personality change and dementia. He was clinically diagnosed as having neurosyphilis by serological tests of the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid. Despite the administration of Penicillin, psychiatric symptoms were unchanged and the patient died of aspiration pneumonia after the clinical course of 18 month. The weight of brain was 1485 g. Postmortem pathological examination of the brain revealed extensive leukocyte infiltration into the meninges, in particular, around the meningeal vessels. Perivascular leukocyte infiltration, though less severe, was also noted in the brain parenchyma in the temporal and frontal cortices. Brain atrophy and neuronal cell loss were absent. The primary pathology of this case was, thus, considered to be meningeal and vascular inflammation consistent with the stage III meningovascular neurosyphilis. However, we also found in the frontal and parietal cortices a few small demyelinating lesions, which were referred to as Fischer's plaques. Fischer's plaque is a hallmark of advanced stage of general paresis where the principal lesion exists in the brain parenchyma. We speculate that, in patients with chronic progressive neurosyphilis, meningovascular and parenchymal lesions coexist during the transitional stage. Attention has to be paid for the occurrence of atypical neurosyphilis in association with increased immuologically compromised hosts and frequent usage of antibiotics.",meningitis
"Nine patients with intracranial pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) completed a short-term clinical and MRI follow-up study. Based on clinical pictures, 4 of them were found to have spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) and the remaining 5 had idiopathic intracranial pachymeningitis (IIP). Both groups were compared regarding their clinical and MRI characteristics. In 4 patients with SIH, gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images (WI) showed a diffuse and even enhancement of the entire intracranial and spinal dura mater. These thickened dura was slightly hyperintense on T2-WI. They had a favorable prognosis. In 2 patients with IIP, MRI demonstrated a relatively focal and even thickening and enhancement of the intracranial dura which was slightly hyperintense with a central hypointense area on T2-WI. These patients showed a very favorable course with or without steroid pulse therapy. In the remaining 3 patients with IIP, MRI depicted a focal, uneven enhancement of the intracranial dura which was relatively hypointense on T2-WI. Two of them with prolonged symptoms had a remitting and relapsing course, and 1 had a favorable outcome. In spite of current limitations in identifying the underlying causes of idiopathic pachymeningeal abnormalities, MRI can characterize the different patterns of pachymeningeal thickening. These findings may also correlate with the clinical picture and may be useful in predicting the response to treatment and prognosis.",meningitis
"Neurosarcoidosis characteristically presents with the onset of cranial nerve palsies or endocrine and electrolyte disturbances in a patient with known systemic sarcoid.

"Clinical features and serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of 50 patients who underwent myelography with iophendylate were studied. Forty two patients (84%) developed one or more features suggestive of meningism lasting for 2-4 days. There was significant rise in the average (mean) CSF counts from 9.81 in the premyelogram sample to 532.6 at the end of 24 hours (p less than 0.001). Both neutrophil and lymphocyte (p less than 000) count increased. At the end of one week, there was significant decrease of total cells in the CSF to 204 (p less than 0.001). Both, neutrophils and lymphocytes decreased. There was significant rise in total proteins in the 24 hours sample, but the fall at one week was not significant statistically. The sugar and chloride values did not change significantly. All CSF samples were negative for bacterial cultures. In conclusion, a significant proportion of the patients undergoing iophendylate myelography develop clinical features suggestive of meningeal irritation and change in the CSF fractions suggestive of meningitis: however these changes are transient and do not warrant institution of chemotherapy or steroids.",meningitis

"A 76 years old patient suffering from insulin dependent diabetes presents a multiple, bilateral and asymmetric cranial neuropathy involving on the left side the cranial nerves VIII, IX with a participation of the efferent autonomic fibers of the nerves VII and IX (xerostomia) and the nerve XII, and involving on both sides the nerves VII and X. Like it is known from literature the nerve XI was spared, probably because of the more caudal emergence from the brainstem. The disease was preceded by a violent otalgia on the left side which was initially interpretated as a malignant external otitis. This affection was associated with an inflammatory syndrome that was easily monitored by the blood sedimentation rate. The course was favorable but marked by fluctuations of the neurological deficits. The MRI shows a pachymeningitis localised at the beginning in the medial fossa and on the cerebellar tentorium, later on the left parieto-occipital convexity. The diagnosis of a focal idiopathic pachymeningitis was confirmed by excluding different other affections like inflammatory, tumoral and infectious diseases, by using MRI examinations, CSF analysis and especially meningeal biopsy. It is a rare inflammatory disease of unknown origin with potentially persistent neurological deficits. We discuss the differential diagnosis and the therapeutical possibilities, which consist in a long term immunosuppression with corticosteroids and azathioprine.",meningitis
"Hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is a rare disorder that causes thickening of the dura mater. Inflammatory lesions may be located in the cerebral or spinal dura mater or, less frequently, in both locations simultaneously. Numerous clinico-pathological entities cause thickening of the pachymeninges. Indeed, HP is a potential manifestation of many different diseases, but the diagnosis often remains uncertain. Cases in which the pachymeningitis has no known aetiology are termed ""idiopathic"" HP (IHP). Recently, it has been suggested that IgG4-related disease represents a subset of cases previously diagnosed as idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis. Little is known regarding the pathogenic events of IHP. In a general theory, the inflammatory infiltrate, mainly consisting of B and T lymphocytes, activates fibroblasts and induces collagen deposition, leading to tissue hypertrophy and increased dural thickness. Clinical manifestations of IHP depend upon the location of the inflammatory lesions and compression of the adjacent nervous structures. Three central pathological features are lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, obliterative phlebitis, and storiform fibrosis. MRI is the examination of choice for the preliminary diagnosis of IHP. Histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen of the dura mater would finally confirm the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis for HP is broad and includes infections, autoimmune disorders, and neoplasia. Currently, there is no consensus about treatment for patients with IHP. There is a preference for glucocorticoid treatment on diagnosis followed by the addition of other immunosuppressive agents in the event of a recurrence. Rituximab is used in patients who did not respond to glucocorticoids or to conventional steroid-sparing agents.",meningitis
"An adult male guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) with a 1-month history of hind limb paresis, torticollis, and seizures was euthanized and submitted for necropsy. Gross examination was unremarkable, but histologic examination revealed multifocal eosinophilic and lymphoplasmacytic choriomeningitis and cross sections of nematode parasites within the leptomeninges of the midbrain and diencephalon. Morphologic features of the nematode were consistent with a metastrongyle, and the parasite was identified as Parelaphostrongylus tenuis by polymerase chain reaction testing and nucleotide sequencing. Further questioning of the owner revealed that the guinea pig was fed grass from a yard often grazed by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a naturally occurring P. tenuis infection in a guinea pig.",meningitis
"Three patients with diffuse idiopathic cranial pachymeningitis with predominant involvement of the tentorium and falx are reported. Progressively increasing headaches were the usual symptoms, along with ataxia and various cranial nerve palsies. CT in all cases and MR imaging in two cases detected isolated thickened dura mater. In one case, MR depicted dural involvement as a very large, hypointense area with fine hyperintense edges on T2-weighted images. Microscopic examination of thickened dura revealed extensive fibrotic tissue with a chronic inflammatory infiltrate containing lymphocytes, plasma cells, and scattered eosinophils; these findings closely paralleled the MR features. Only four cases with similar pathologies have been described, all before the advent of CT and MR. We discuss the different causes of thickened dura mater as well as the significance of the fact that dural thickening can be responsible for occlusion of the dural sinuses. Cranial pachymeningitis is a rarely reported disease that can resemble other disorders associated with tentorial thickening; CT and MR can help differentiate it from these other disorders.",meningitis
"Aim: To look for the clinical implications of increased cortical fractional anisotropy (FA) in meningitis patients associated with brain abscess. Material and methods: Diffusion tensor imaging was performed in 10 patients of meningitis associated with brain abscess and 10 controls. The region of interest analysis was performed to calculate FA and mean diffusivity values from the abscess cavity and cortical regions of patients (enhancing and nonenhancing meninges on postcontrast T1-weighted images) and controls. Results: Significantly increased FA values with no change in mean diffusivity values were found in enhancing (FA = 0.113 +/- 0.023, P = 0.000) as well as nonenhancing (FA = 0.085 +/- 0.009, P = 0.000) cortical region of patients compared with controls (FA = 0.067 +/- 0.010). Conclusions: Increased FA values in the enhancing as well as nonenhancing cortical regions suggest diffuse inflammatory activity in the pia-arachnoid in meningitis patients. It also suggests that FA may be a better indicator of active and diffuse meningeal inflammation than postcontrast T1-weighted images.",meningitis
"The child with a stiff neck can be a challenging diagnostic exercise. Four unusual examples of acute neck stiffness, not associated with meningitis, are presented to illustrate the various pathologic conditions which may produce this symptom. A differential diagnostic schema is suggested on the basis of pathologic and physiologic alterations of cervical and paracervical anatomic structures.",meningitis
"In developed countries with a low incidence of tuberculosis, infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is easily overlooked as the cause of meningitis in an immunocompetent adult. Two cases are presented, with emphasis on the main reasons for delay of diagnosis. Neuroradiology revealed a progressive hypertrophic basal meningitis.

"We describe the case of a 52-year-old man, with cryptococcal meningitis and meningeal fibrosis who had undergone ventricular shunting. Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted MRI revealed diffuse meningeal enhancement. Remarkably, there was enhancement of the pia mater and posterior fossa subarachnoid space.",meningitis
"In a verified case of tuberculous meningitis, computerized tomographic scans showed a striking postcontrast enhancement of the cisterns around the base of the brain and the brainstem as well as the cortical meninges.

"Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute, autoimmune polyradiculoneuropathy that improves with immune-modulating treatment if instituted early in the illness. Preliminary diagnosis relies on the clinician's recognition of the typical symptoms and signs as supporting evidence of the illness, such as nerve conduction studies, which may not be available emergently. We report eight children with Guillain-Barré syndrome in whom the initial presentation was atypical and suggested a primary central nervous system illness. In these patients, the predominant clinical symptoms included drowsiness, headache, irritability, and meningismus, although the classic features of Guillain-Barré syndrome (weakness, hyporeflexia) were also present. The atypical presentation caused delay in diagnosis in some cases. It is important to recognize this variant of pediatric Guillain-Barré syndrome to ensure expeditious diagnosis and treatment.",meningitis
"A 30-year-old, previously healthy, non-addicted man presented with a chronic spinal meningitis complicated by arachnoiditis and spinal cord compression. Biopsy showed a chronic granulomatous leptomeningitis, in which some cells contained branching septate organisms that were immunostained with an antiserum to Aspergillus fumigatus. Precipitins to A. fumigatus were detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but not in blood, and aspergillus infection was apparently restricted to the leptomeninges. Clinically successful treatment led to the disappearance of CSF precipitins and oligoclonal bands.",meningitis
"A case of chronic cerebrospinal meningitis is described which caused considerable diagnostic difficulties. Postmortem examination demonstrated parasitic character of the disease. Although all cysts were sterile, the authors suggest in the discussion that in the case the cause was infestation with the larval from of the canine tapeworm Taenia multiceps.",meningitis
"Objective and design: alpha-Melanoycte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), a neuropeptide hormone with reported anti-microbial and immuno-modulatory properties in vitro, has previously been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of children with bacterial meningitis. We investigated the therapeutic effects of alpha-MSH administration on Neisseria meningitidis infection of human meningeal cell cultures in vitro. Materials and methods: Meningeal cell lines (n = 2) were infected with meningococci (10(2)-10(8) cfu/monolayer), isolated bacterial outer membranes (OM; 1 microg/ml) or lipo-oligosaccharide (LOS; 1 microg/ml) with and without alpha-MSH (10(-5)-10 microM). Bacterial adherence was quantified at 6 h, and cytokine production and microbicidal activity of alpha-MSH for meningococci were assessed at 24 h. Results: Compared with infection by meningococci alone, alpha-MSH (10 microM) up-regulated secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 (mean values increased from approximately 33 to 60 ng/ml), RANTES (mean values increased from approximately 26 to 105 ng/ml) and GM-CSF (mean values increased from approximately 0.3 to 1 ng/ml; P < 0.05). Upregulated secretion correlated with a neuropeptide-mediated rapid and >5-fold increase (P < 0.05) in bacterial adherence to cells and was dependent on OM components including LOS acting synergistically with alpha-MSH. Meningococci were resistant to the anti-microbial activity of alpha-MSH at all concentrations tested. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that a potentially therapeutic neuropeptide exerts pro-inflammatory effects during meningococcal infection in vitro and its use in the treatment of meningitis is contra-indicated.",meningitis
"Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease characterised by non-caseating granulomas affecting mainly the lung and lymphatics. Literature reveals that 5% of the patients of sarcoidosis have involvement of the nervous system. Various neurological complications of sarcoidosis commonly reported are cranial nerve palsies, aseptic meningitis, myelopathy and intracranial masses. We report unusual case of neurosarcoidosis who presented with combination of right-sided vision loss and complete ophthalmoplegia with extensive leptomeningitis. This patient was suffering from resistant diabetes which leads to therapeutic problems.",meningitis
"Clinical signs of toxicosis, neurologic lesions, and elevated tissue residues of methylmercury (MM) were produced in 12 pigs by oral administration of 1.29, 0.86, 0.64, and 0.43 mg mercury/kg of body weight daily as methylmercuric hydroxide (MMH). Clinical signs which began on day 17 were ataxia, dysmetria, blindness, convulsions, paresis, and death. Time of onset of signs was inversely related to size of daily dose. Microscopic lesions were found in the cerebrum brain stem, and spinal cord, and correlated well with clinical signs. The cerebrum in which severity of lesions was directly related to length of exposure was the most severely affected region of the central nervous system (CNS). Lesions were neuronal necrosis, neuronophagia, cortical vacuolation, axon swelling, gliosis, leptomeningitis, and vascular fibrinoid necrosis. Neuronal necrosis was most extensive within mid and deep cerebrocortical laminae. Brain residues of MM were directly proportional to the size of daily dose, and statistically significant. Distribution of MM among different tissues was rather uniform with highest concentrations found in liver, followed by kidney, muscle, spleen, and brain.",meningitis
"The paper contains a clinico-morphological description of a case with late sequelae of treated tubercular meningitis. The patient at 7 years of age had tuberculous meningitis which was treated by suboccipital and endolumbar administration of streptomycin. Following 12 years, epileptical seizures ensued with an eventual gradual weakness in the extremities leading to profound spastic tetraparesis. During the last years of life contractures and stem symptoms developed. The morphological picture was characterized by posttuberculous fibrous leptomeningitis with an extensive internal hydrocephalus, universal sclerosis of the cerebral and spinal vessels, disseminated demyelinization in the spinal cord and brain, a distinct improverishment of the grey matter by ganglionic cells. The result of liquorohemodynamical disorders was a syringolike cavity in the spinal cord. Under the ependima of the laral ventricle calcified cholesteatomas were found, which are considered as complications of suboccipital punctures in administering streptomycin.",meningitis
"Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is a rare chronic inflammatory and fibrosing process of unknown etiology. This entity is characterized by fibrosis and thickening of the dura mater and resulting in neurological syndrome. The authors report a 72 year-old woman who presented with progressive bifrontal headache, bilateral visual loss and transient episode of confusion. Neurological examination revealed bilateral optic atrophy, apathy and no focal neurological deficit. Investigations showed anemia of chronic disease, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. No specific inflammatory diseases or malignancy such as systemic lupus erythematosus, syphilis, hematologic malignancy were found MRI of the brain revealed thickened and enhanced dura mater and leptomeninges at the inferior aspect of bilateral frontal lobes as well as vasogenic edema of the frontal lobes. Cerebrospinal fluid showed mild pleocytosis, high protein level and normal glucose level. Meningeal biopsy revealed nonspecific inflammatory process of the dura and leptomeninges. There was no granuloma formation or evidence of vasculitis. Special stain for tuberculous bacilli, fungus and malignancy were all negative. The diagnosis of ""idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis"" was made. The patient was treated with oral prednisolone 45 mg/day. Her headache was improved, but the profound vision loss in both eyes remained unchanged after 2 years of follow-up. Prednisolone was tapered within 18 months. Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis usually involves dura at tentorium cerebelli, cavernous sinus and base of the skull. The extensive involvement at the anterior cranial fossa is extremely rare.",meningitis
"Background and objective: Bacterial meningitis is a serious neurologic illness with significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and treated promptly and appropriately. The presentation and management are influenced by host factors and the pathogenic organism; the purpose of this review is to highlight those differences and to survey the literature on current practices and emerging developments in evaluation and management. Review summary: Clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for bacterial meningitis. The classic symptoms of bacterial meningitis are fever, neck stiffness, altered mental status, and headache. Certain patient populations, such as the young and the immunocompromised, may have a blunted presentation, and for these patients, clinicians must have an especially low threshold for obtaining a lumbar puncture. When bacterial meningitis is suspected, antibiotic therapy should be initiated as soon as possible because early treatment is associated with a better outcome. In addition, the use of the corticosteroid dexamethasone has been shown to be helpful as an adjuvant therapy in specific clinical situations. New adjuvant therapies are being developed to lower the high rate of complications that currently occur in patients with bacterial meningitis. Conclusions: Recent studies have altered the evaluation and management of bacterial meningitis. In addition, they have elucidated the mechanisms through which bacterial meningitis causes complications and have identified new targets for treatment.",meningitis

"Rationale: Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis (IHP) is a rare condition, characterized by a chronic fibrosing inflammatory process usually involving either the intracranial or spinal dura mater, but rarely both. Here, we report a rare case of IHP affecting both the intracranial and spinal dura mater. We also discussed the diagnosis, management, and outcome of IHP. Patient concerns: We reviewed the case of a 60-year-old woman presenting with chronic headache, multiple cranial nerve palsies and gait disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her head revealed thickened and contrast-enhanced dura in the craniocervical region as well as obstructive hydrocephalus and cerebellar tonsillar herniation. The patient had a suboccipital craniectomy and posterior decompression through C1 plus a total laminectomy. The dura was partially resected to the extent of the bony decompression, and a duroplasty was performed. Diagnoses: Microscopic examination of the surgically resected sample showed chronic inflammatory changes, lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltration, fibrous tissue hyperplasia, and hyaline degeneration. Blood tests to evaluate the secondary causes of hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) were unremarkable. Interventions: Steroid was used to treat suspected IHP. Outcomes: Postoperatively, the patient showed gradual improvement in her headache, glossolalia, and bucking. Prior to discharge, a follow-up MRI showed improvement of the dura mater thickening. Lessons: IHP is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the dura mater that usually causes neurological deficits. Clinical manifestations of IHP, MRI findings, and laboratory abnormalities are the essential components for making an accurate diagnosis. When the radiological or laboratory evaluation is uncertain, but neurological deficits are present, a prompt surgical approach should be considered. Postoperative steroid therapy and close observation for recurrence are necessary to ensure a good long-term outcome.",meningitis
"A 51-year-old female presented with an extremely rare case of idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis manifesting as markedly thickened frontotemporal meninges with expanding perifocal edema. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium revealed enhancement of the thickened dura mater protruding into the brain parenchyma accompanied by focal edema causing a mass effect. Histological examination of a biopsy specimen revealed thickened dura with infiltrating lymphocytes. Serological and immunological tests were normal. No inflammatory response or evidence of malignant tumors was observed. The patient was treated with predonisolone, resulting in marked improvement of the mass effect. High-dose steroid therapy appears to be effective for intracranial pachymeningitis associated with expanding perifocal brain edema.",meningitis
"Central nervous system infections account for 1% of primary hospital admissions and 2% of nosocomial infections and when encountered require prompt diagnosis and initiation of specific treatment. Imaging findings are mostly nonspecific with respect to the causative pathogen. This article describes the anatomy of cranial meninges and extra-axial spaces of the brain. Characteristic findings and recent advances in neuroimaging of meningitis and its complications and ventriculitis are summarized, and certain noninfectious causes of meningitis and meningitis mimics are described.",meningitis
"In patients with neoplastic meningitis (NM), the rapid institution of intrathecal therapy may ameliorate the course of disease, indicating that a timely diagnosis is clinically relevant. As immunocytology (IC) of cerebrospinal fluid and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as diagnostic methods, have potential pitfalls, the present study assessed the results of both methods, to determine the predictive capability of the initial evaluations with respect to the risk that the patient would develop NM during the course of their disease. A total of 166 individuals with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL; n = 95), B-acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL; n = 18), acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 27) or solid tumours (n = 26), with at least one definitive IC and MRI result within 3 weeks, were evaluated at a median follow-up of 29.5 months (range 6-53 months). IC and MRI results reached the highest concordance (98%) in B-NHL patients and were most discordant in ALL patients (43%). In haematological malignancies, IC displayed considerable sensitivity, ranging from 89% to 95%, while MRI had very low sensitivity. Conversely, MRI showed high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (92%) in solid tumours. We conclude that IC is of particular value in the diagnosis of NM due to haematological malignancies while MRI is superior to IC in the diagnosis of NM due to solid tumours.",meningitis
"Background and purpose: Subcortical low-intensity lesion on T2-weighted images is an uncommon manifestation of ischemia, multiple sclerosis, and Sturge-Weber disease. This study was performed to determine whether subcortical low signal intensity is an MR feature of meningitis, viral encephalitis, or leptomeningeal metastasis and to investigate a cause of subcortical low intensity. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed MR images of 117 patients with meningitis, encephalitis (viral or unknown), or leptomeningeal metastasis for the presence of subcortical low intensity, meningeal enhancement, signal intensity change of cortex, and change in subcortical low intensity on follow-up images. Diffusion-weighted (DW) images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were obtained in 55 patients. Subcortical low-intensity lesions were also quantitatively analyzed on T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and DW images. Results: Subcortical low intensity was found in nine (23.7%) of 38 patients with encephalitis (viral, 31; unknown origin, 7), five (24%) of 21 with leptomeningeal metastasis, and five (9%) of 58 with meningitis. Leptomeningeal enhancement was observed in 100% and cortical hyperintensity in 14 (74%) of 19 patients with subcortical low intensity. Leptomeningeal enhancement was seen in 46 (47%) and cortical hyperintensity in 33 (34%) of 98 patients without subcortical low intensity. Subcortical low intensity disappeared or decreased in extent on follow-up MR images in all seven patients who underwent follow-up. ADC of subcortical low-intensity lesions was lower than that of the contralateral area and decreased by 9.3 +/- 11.4%. Conclusion: Subcortical low intensity was uncommonly found in meningitis, viral encephalitis, and leptomeningeal metastasis. It is a nonspecific MR sign of various meningeal and cortical diseases. Although the cause of subcortical low intensity remains uncertain, free radical formation may play a role as a causative factor.",meningitis

"Human cerebral angiostrongyliasis becomes an emerging disease in many parts of the world. By postmortem examination, Angiostrongylus cantonensis have been reported to cause severe pathological changes in the central nervous system. The present study was designed to determine the temporal-spatial pathological changes through experimental infections and histopathological examination of permissive (SD rats) and non-permissive (ICR mice) hosts. After infecting SD rats with 25, 50, or 100 third-stage larvae (L3) and ICR mice with 25 L3, one animal from each group was sacrificed daily from day 1 to day 30 post-infection. Each rat brain was cut into six sections and mouse brain into five sections. These sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and examined microscopically. Eosinophilic meningitis was found to be the most commonly pathological change and occurred on day 17 post-infection in rats with 25 L3, day 9 in the 50- or 100-L3 groups, and day 12 in infected mice. Thickness of the meninges increased 9-24 folds in infected rats and 89 folds in an infected mouse on day 28. Encephalitis, congestion, perivascular cuffing, and haemorrhage were revealed in infected mice and rats with 100 L3. Fifth-stage larvae were frequently observed in the meninges but occasionally in the parenchyma. Significant correlations between meningitis and presence of larvae in the meninges were found in the three infected rat groups but not in the infected mice. The results indicate that the clinical course of A. cantonensis infection is not self-limited but becomes more severe with the intensity of infection.",meningitis
"Objective: To determine the frequency and nature of leptomeningeal contrast enhancement in multiple sclerosis (MS) via in vivo 3-tesla postcontrast T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI and 7-tesla postmortem MRI-pathology correlation. Methods: Brain MRI, using the postcontrast T2-weighted, FLAIR technique, was prospectively collected in 299 MS cases and 37 age-matched neurologically healthy controls. Expert raters evaluated focal gadolinium enhancement in the leptomeningeal compartment. Two progressive MS cases came to autopsy after in vivo MRI characterization. Pathologic and immunohistochemical examination assessed the association of enhancement with leptomeningeal inflammation and adjacent cortical demyelination. Results: Focal contrast enhancement was detected in the leptomeningeal compartment in 74 of 299 MS cases (25%) vs 1 of 37 neurologically healthy controls (2.7%; p = 0.001). Enhancement was nearly twice as frequent (p = 0.009) in progressive MS (39/118 cases, 33%) as in relapsing-remitting MS (35/181, 19%). Enhancing foci generally remained stable throughout the evaluation period (up to 5.5 years). Pathology showed perivascular lymphocytic and mononuclear infiltration in the enhancing areas in association with flanking subpial cortical demyelination. Conclusion: Leptomeningeal contrast enhancement occurs frequently in MS and is a noninvasive, in vivo marker of inflammation and associated subpial demyelination. It might therefore enable testing of new treatments aimed at eliminating this inflammation and potentially arresting progressive MS.",meningitis
"A patient with meningeal irritation and a small occipital cystic lesion is presented. Based on serological tests, the condition was diagnosed as presumably echinococcosis.

"Leptomeningeal enhancement on CT and MR imaging studies secondary to cryptococcal meningitis is an uncommon finding. In immunocompromised patients, this meningitis incites only a mild inflammatory reaction and abnormalities are often absent on imaging studies. We recently encountered two patients with cryptococcal meningitis in whom postcontrast MR imaging showed thick enhancing subarachnoid spaces. Both had cryptococcal meningitis at autopsy. In a different patient with cryptococcal meningitis, postmortem MR imaging and pathologic examinations showed that these areas of enhancement correspond to abundant mucoid material secreted by the yeasts.",meningitis
"Introduction: Wegener's granulomatosis is a systemic vasculitis which, in its classical form, is characterized by involvement of the superior and inferior respiratory tract and the kidneys. The vasculitis may be multisystemic. Ophthalmic and neurological involvement are common (22% and 54% of those affected respectively). When considering involvement of the nervous system, the commonest finding is peripheral neuropathy, particularly in the form of multiple mononeuritis. Meningeal involvement is exceptional. Clinical case and conclusions: We present a case of Wegener's granulomatosis with meningeal involvement, studied using CT and MR. The findings using imaging techniques are described, and conditions which should be considered in the differential diagnosis are discussed.",meningitis
"Background: Rupture of brain abscess into the subarachnoid space as a cause of meningitis is rare. Early diagnosis improves the outcome. There is no previous report of MR demonstration of rupture of brain abscess into the subarachnoid space. Case description: Two young adults with chronic suppurative otitis media presenting with signs of increased intracranial pressure and meningeal irritation underwent magnetic resonance imaging, which showed brain abscess with evidence of rupture into the subarachnoid space and meningitis. This helped in early diagnosis and aggressive management. Conclusion: In cases of brain abscess where meningitis is suspected clinically, documentation of rupture of the abscess into the subarachnoid space will help in avoiding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination that may be disastrous in these patients who already have increased intracranial pressure.",meningitis
"Neoplastic meningitis is a diffuse dissemination of tumour cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leptomeninges, or both. It occurs in approximately 5-10% of malignant diseases, most often in breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and B-cell lymphoma. Symptoms of neoplastic meningitis include head or back pain, cranial nerve palsies, diffuse radicular symptoms, and psychiatric disturbances. Magnetic resonance imaging shows nodular contrast enhancement lining the CSF spaces. Positive CSF cytology requires optimal sampling and processing, and the treatment of neoplastic meningitis must be individualized. The CSF dissemination can be treated with intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate or Ara-C. Radiotherapy should be applied only to symptomatic solid spinal manifestations or fast progressing cranial nerve palsies. Systemic chemotherapy is needed to control solid manifestations or, in the case of substances entering the CSF, to support intrathecal chemotherapy.",meningitis
"A case of idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis with an unusual and misleading manifestation is reported. Computed tomography scan, angiographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings were suggestive of multiple meningeal neoplasms and a correct diagnosis was made only after meningeal biopsy.

"Background: Measurement of concentrations of acute-phase proteins (APPs) is used as an aid in the diagnosis of a variety of diseases in animals. Objective: To determine the concentration of APPs in dogs with steroid responsive meningitis-arteritis (SRMA) and other neurologic diseases. Animals: One hundred and thirty-three dogs with neurologic diseases, 6 dogs with sepsis, and 8 healthy dogs were included in the study. Thirty-six dogs had SRMA (31 of which had monitoring), 14 dogs had other meningoencephalitides (ME), 32 had disk disease (IVDD/DLSS), 26 had tumors affecting the central nervous system (TCNS), and 25 had idiopathic epilepsy (IE). Methods: Prospective, observational study: C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha(2)-macroglobulin (AMG), and albumin concentrations were determined in the serum or plasma. CRP was also measured in the cerebrospinal fluid. Results: Serum CRP was significantly higher in dogs with SRMA (x=142 microg/mL+/-75) and sepsis (x=114 microg/mL+/-67) in comparison with dogs with other neurologic diseases (x=2.3-21 microg/mL; P< .001). There was no significant difference detected in AMG between groups. Serum albumin concentration was significantly lower (P< .01) in dogs with SRMA (x=3.2 g/dL+/-0.41) than in other groups (x=3.6-3.9 g/dL). Serum CRP concentration of SRMA dogs correlated with alkaline phosphatase levels (r=0.515, P= .003). Conclusions and clinical importance: CRP concentrations in serum are useful in diagnosis of dogs with SRMA. Serum CRP could be used as a monitoring parameter in treatment management of these dogs.",meningitis
"A 49-year-old diabetic woman developed polymicrobial anaerobic meningitis secondary to a meningorectal fistula one year after receiving neutron beam therapy for a rectal adenocarcinoma. The meningitis was refractory to chloramphenicol and penicillin but responded to oral metronidazole. Sustained eradication of meningitis was achieved with continued metronidazole for 51/2 months, despite persistence of the fistula. Metronidazole may be a superior antimicrobial agent for polymicrobial anaerobic meningitis, especially when caused by a large or continuing bacterial inoculum. This meningorectal fistula is the first of its kind to our knowledge to be demonstrated by microbiologic, radiologic, and pathologic studies.",meningitis

"Immunoglobulin G4-related disease is an increasingly recognized, idiopathic systemic disorder that might be associated with elevated serum IgG4 level and tissue infiltration by IgG4-positive plasma cells. We describe the clinical features and biopsy findings in a patient who presented with features suggestive of pachymeningitis and multiple cranial neuropathies. Meningeal biopsy and other laboratory studies established the diagnosis of IgG4-related hypertrophic pachymeningitis. Despite treatment with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil, the patient exhibited a fluctuating progressive course, which stabilized with rituximab, although the radiological findings persisted over 2½ years of follow-up. Our case highlights many important evolving concepts in the disorder, including unusual pathologic features, lack of correlation between serum IgG4 levels and the clinical course, and posttreatment clinicoradiological discordance. We provide potential explanations for this discrepancy, highlight the validity of novel cerebrospinal fluid studies and progressive systemic involvement despite use of immune-suppressive treatments, and emphasize the usefulness of rituximab as a disease-stabilizing agent.",meningitis
"Reported complications of intrathecal steroid therapy include aseptic meningitis, infectious meningitis, and arachnoiditis. We report a case of sclerosing spinal pachymeningitis complicating the attempted intrathecal administration of Depo-Medrol for multiple sclerosis. The lesion is characterised by concentric laminar proliferation of neomembranes within the subdural space of the entire spinal cord and cauda equina, resulting from repeated episodes of injury and repair to the spinal dura mater by Depo-Medrol. There is clinical and laboratory evidence that Depo-Medrol produces meningeal irritation and that the vehicle is the necrotising fraction.",meningitis
"Hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is a rare disorder that frequently presents with multiple cranial neuropathies. This disorder, which is characterized by thickening and infiltration of the cranial dura, can result from a variety of inflammatory and infectious conditions. A patient with hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is described in whom meningeal biopsy and bacterial cultures of the biopsy specimen revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The authors believe this to be the first documented case of pachymeningitis secondary to this organism.",meningitis
"Some clinical and pathological features of carcinomatosis of the meninges are reviewed along with a report of four cases. This condition usually presents in middle age as a subacute meningitis with cranial nerve involvement, but the diagnostic importance of the various mental disturbances which may be encountered early in its course are noted. The acute or subacute course may reflect a widespread mechanical interference with normal cerebral metabolism, a notion which is supported by recent clinical measurements in these patients of the rate of glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier. It is probable that the route taken by tumour cells to reach the meningeal spaces is a relatively unimportant factor in determining this pattern of growth and that the intrinsic growth characteristics of the primary tumour, its nutritional needs, and gravity probably play the major roles in production of this unusual type of secondary invasion. Greater therapeutic use of irradiation for these patients is encouraged.",meningitis
"Two cases of meningeal sarcoidosis with unusual and misleading presentations are reported. In the first case, CT scan, angiographic, and MRI findings were indistinguishable from those of meningioma. CSF pleiocytosis may help in diagnosing sarcoid pseudo-meningioma. The second patient had transient focal deficits and pachymeningitis of the convexity. The transient deficits were probably of epileptic origin based on their response to antiepileptic treatment. The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis was made only after meningeal biopsy, despite thorough investigations.",meningitis
"Thirteen patients with subdural empyema underwent arteriography preoperatively and three were restudied postoperatively. Arterial vascular changes were found in nine cases and consisted of localized or diffuse arterial irregularities. In two cases the arterial changes resolved with effective therapy. These arterial changes are similar in appearance and response to therapy to those noted with meningitis; however, in this series they were shown to have occured in seven cases with subdural empyema but without associated meningitis. Therefore, empyema alone may cause localized or diffuse arterial irregularities.",meningitis
"The leptomeningeal reaction and the cerebrospinal fluid reaction of the canine inflammatory response were investigated concurrently. One-half milliliter cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was withdrawn from the cisterna magna of 17 anesthetized mongrel dogs and analyzed. Using this same spinal tap, control and experimental animals were injected with 0.5 ml sterile saline and 0.5 ml defibrinated chicken erythrocytes, respectively. A second spinal tap was performed 2 to 168 hr later. The CSF from the first spinal tap contained less than 1 WBC/mm3. The cell population was unchanged in the second spinal tap of control animals. In experimental animals, the WBC population increased more than 100-fold by 24 hr. Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) appeared in the CSF first, followed by lymphocytes and monocytes. Injected erythrocytes seemed trapped in the subarachnoid space (SAS), especially in the inner sheet of the arachnoid mater. The leptomeninges had a substantial increase in free cells without fibrosis. Pial and leptomeningeal cells of the arachnoid trabeculae appeared swollen. Two hours after injection, chicken erythrocytes were phagocytosed by pial cells, macrophages, and free cells adherent to the leptomeninges. The epiplexus cell populations for saline-control and erythrocyte-experimental animals were similar, suggesting that the choroid plexuses were not a gateway for PMN, lymphocyte, or monocyte infusion into the SAS.",meningitis
"Cefpirome is a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a low protein binding, a long half-life of elimination and a wide antibacterial spectrum including pseudomonas and staphylococcus. We studied its diffusion into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cefpirome, 2 g, was administered intravenously over 3 min. Nineteen patients, aged 12-75 y (mean +/- SD = 40 +/- 20) were studied: 13 had meningitis (septic = 6; chronic = 2; viral = 4). Seric and CSF samples were assayed by the high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedure. Results at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 hours after the infusion were (mean +/- SD) 62.44 +/- 19.8 mg/l, 26.51 +/- 3.7 mg/l, 10.19 +/- 3.3 mg/l, 3.99 +/- 2.3 mg/l, 2 +/- 1.72 mg/l in the serum and 1.1 +/- 1 mg/l, 2.6 +/- 1.8 mg/l, 2.83 +/- 1.7 mg/l, 1.92 +/- 1 mg/l, 1.83 +/- 0.36 mg/l in CSF of bacterial meningitidis respectively. The half-life of elimination were 2.45 h and 9.8 h in the blood and CSF respectively. The area under the curve CSF/serum ratio was 28%. We conclude that cefpirome concentrations in the CSF were above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of almost all the bacteria causing meningitis.",meningitis
"In the present work, the involvement of cranial and spinal nerve roots in tuberculous meningitis was studied. Cranial nerves of 11 cases and the spinal roots of three patients were examined by means of serial sections of the base of the brain, brainstem and spinal cord. Although entrapment of the nerves by the tenacious inflammatory exudate was prominent, vasculitis lesions of the cranial nerves and spinal roots were also frequently observed. The latter could be an additional cause of nerve palsies in tuberculous meningitis.",meningitis
"A 54-year-old female patient with a 10-year history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt resulting from communicating hydrocephalus of undetermined aetiology is reported. Transient gait disturbances and cerebral infarction at the age of 46 did not lead to further insights into the nature of the disease. After many years with only occasional disturbances, a distinct organic brain syndrome developed. Thorough examination led to a tentative diagnosis of neurocysticercosis; this was based on the history, liquor diagnosis and cerebral microcalcifications in CT. Despite the initiation of specific therapy, the patient died of the sequelae of the disease. At autopsy, characteristic cicatricial residues of mainly basal leptomeningitis were found with collapsed parasitic cysts. Additional intracerebral mesenchymal-glial reactions were less conspicuous. Residual ependymitis had caused aqueductal stenosis. Death was due to cachexia, bronchopneumonia and a lung abscess. The clinical course and morphology of neurocysticercosis are discussed. The disease has become rare in our country, but is globally the most important parasitic disease of the central nervous system.",meningitis
"Background/objective: Pseudomeningocele is most commonly the result of a rent in the meninges during spine surgery. Noniatrogenic causes exist but are rare. Pseudomeningoceles may heal spontaneously, but they may also slowly enlarge. They rarely present as a mass within the abdomen. The objective of this study was to present the first case report of hydronephrosis secondary to lumbar pseudomeningocele. Design: Single case report and literature review. Methods: Single case report. Results: This man had undergone extensive lumbar spine surgery for pain and spondylolisthesis. He subsequently developed a pseudomeningocele that caused hydronephrosis of the left kidney. He was treated with surgical intervention and had resolution of his hydronephrosis and his flank and groin pain. He also had improvement of his back pain. Conclusions: This report shows an unusual cause of hydronephrosis-a pseudomeningocele presenting as an abdominal mass that compressed the ureter.",meningitis
"Rationale and objectives: The ability of high-field (1.5 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect early brain meningitis was evaluated in a canine model. Contrast dose, timing postinjection, and imaging technique (specifically the use of magnetization transfer) were assessed. Methods: Imaging of five canines was performed at 1.5 T 24 hours after injection of Cowans staphylococcus into the cisterna magna. Two control animals also were imaged using the same protocol, with one animal receiving a cisternal injection of nutrient broth only and the other no injection. Contrast doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.8 mmol/kg gadoteridol (Gd HP-DO3A or Pro-Hance) were compared. Scans were performed at 2, 12, and 22 minutes after an initial injection of 0.1 mmol/kg. At each time point, paired T1-weighted scans with and without magnetization transfer (MT) were acquired. Thirty minutes after the initial injection of contrast, a supplemental dose of 0.2 mmol/kg was given (for a cumulative dose of 0.3 mmol/kg). Scans were then repeated at 2, 12, and 22 minutes after this dose was administered. A second supplemental contrast injection of 0.5 mmol/kg (for a cumulative dose of 0.8 mmol/kg) was given at 70 minutes, and immediate postinjection scans with and without MT were acquired. Results: In the animals receiving a cisternal injection of bacteria, the degree of meningeal enhancement was greatest at 0.8 mmol/kg, intermediate at 0.3 mmol/kg, and least at 0.1 mmol/kg. These conclusions were constant whether imaging was performed with or without MT. Scans in control studies did not demonstrate abnormal meningeal enhancement. High-contrast dose, MT, and acquisition of immediate postcontrast scans all resulted in statistically significant improvement. On masked film review, abnormal meningeal enhancement was noted in only 2 of 5 experimental dogs at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg (regardless of the use of MT) compared with all animals at a dose of 0.3 mmol/kg. In 18 of 37 dogs (paired scans with and without MT), when abnormal enhancement was noted, the use of MT improved the visualization of abnormal meningeal enhancement. Conclusions: In early brain meningitis, high-contrast dose (0.3 mmol/kg), MT, and scanning immediately after injection improve detection of abnormal meningeal enhancement, thus facilitating the diagnosis of meningitis. Of these factors, contrast dose is the most important.",meningitis
"A 66-year-old woman had autopsy-proven miliary tuberculosis, with regional involvement of the meninges of the left Sylvian fissure. Radionuclide studies of the brain demonstrated the unusual findings of increased perfusion to the left hemisphere and linear increased activity corresponding to the left Sylvian fissure. Computed tomography of the brain was initially within normal limits at a time when the radionuclide study was clearly abnormal.",meningitis
"Introduction: Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis (IHP) is a rare fibrosing inflammatory process of unknown pathogenesis that causes diffuse thickening of the duramater. In spite of the fact that this pathological entity has been linked to specific etiological agents such as syphilis, tuberculosis, mycosis and sarcoidosis, In recent years there has been an increase in the number of patients with IHP of undetermined cause. Case report: 58 year-old female with a long date history of oppressive headaches, frontally located at first, and later generalized, accompanied by weakness and asthenia; urinary incontinence, dizziness, vomiting, and gait ataxia. Physical examination revealed bilateral cerebellar signs, and optic atrophy. Magnetic resonance displayed a diffuse thickening of the falx cerebrii, and cerebellar tentorium, hypointense in T1 and T2- weighted images, and markedly enhanced following administration of intravenous Gd-DTPA. A biopsy obtained from the falx revealed conspicuous fibrosis, and focal chronic inflammatory mononuclear infiltrate. Complementary exams carried out in order to reveal a specific etiologic agent were negative. Conclusion: Due to the variable clinical presentation, and the difficulty to establish the etiology of the pathological process, to make the diagnosis of IHP usually represents a true dilemma. This diagnosis is often made by exclusion.",meningitis
"Disruption of the central nervous system (CNS) barriers is one of the major pathophysiological consequences of bacterial meningitis. The increase in the permeability of the CNS barriers caused by the disruption is thought to contribute to the development of adverse neurological outcomes. We have established a method by which the CNS barrier permeability can be demonstrated by the gadolinium-enhancement ratio (GER) calculated from the T₁ weighted image (T₁WI) which is based on gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (GdEMRI). The present study examined the disruption of CNS barriers such as blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) and blood-arachnoid barrier (BAB) in rats with meningitis induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or interleukin (IL)-1β. Four hours after intracisternal injection of LPS or IL-1β, severe disruption of the BAB, but not the BBB or BCSFB, was observed. This suggests that the BAB, rather than the BBB or BCSFB, plays a key role in the influx of blood-borne cells and substances during meningitis. The BAB is therefore more vulnerable to disruption than the BBB or BCSFB during meningitis in rats. In addition, GdEMRI with GER imaging analysis appears to be useful in spatio-temporal studies on the function of the CNS barriers under various physiological and pathological conditions.",meningitis
An apneic and tetraplegic infant with an open lumbosacral myelomeningocele and an Arnold-Chiari malformation is reviewed. An exuberant chronic aseptic meningitis with foreign body giant cells and immunoreactive keratin was present around the spinal cord and brainstem.

"Background and aim: We sought to study the frequency and predictors of stroke in tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and its prognostic significance. Design: This was an observational study in a tertiary care teaching hospital. Methods: In all, 122 patients with TBM aged 4 to 82 years diagnosed on the basis of clinical, cerebrospinal fluid, and magnetic resonance imaging criteria were prospectively evaluated. Severity of meningitis was graded into stage I to III. Magnetic resonance imaging was done at admission and 3 months after treatment. Outcome was defined at 3 and 6 months as complete, partial, or poor. Predictors of stroke and its significance in long- and short-term outcome were evaluated. Findings: A total of 55 patients had stroke; 42 at admission and 13 developed within 3 months of 4 drug antitubercular treatment. Strokes were ischemic in 54 (hemorrhagic transformation in 7) and hemorrhagic in one. Basal ganglia infarctions were present in 30, thalamic in 9, brainstem in 10, cortical in 27, and cerebellar in 4 patients. Stoke was multiple in 29 patients. In all, 38 patients had infarctions in anterior circulation, 7 in posterior, and 10 in both. Stroke was significantly related to stage of meningitis, hydrocephalus, exudate, and hypertension. No difference was found in clinical or laboratory parameters in early and late strokes. At 6 months, 28 patients died. At 3 months there were 21 patients lost to follow up and at 6 months there were 30 patients lost to followup. Outcome is based on the rest of the patients, ie. 101 patients at 3 months and 92 patients at 6 months. Conclusion: Stroke occurs in 45% of patients with TBM both in early and later stage, mostly in basal ganglia region, and predicts poor outcome at 3 months.",meningitis
"The interactions of bacterial pathogens with cells of the human leptomeninges are critical events in the progression of meningitis. An in vitro model based on the culture of human meningioma cells was used to investigate the interactions of the meningeal pathogens Escherichia coli K1, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A rank order of association with meningioma cells was observed, with N. meningitidis showing the highest levels of adherence, followed by E. coli, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Neisseria meningitidis and H. influenzae did not invade meningioma cells or induce cell death, but induced a concentration-dependent secretion of inflammatory mediators. Neisseria meningitidis induced higher levels of IL-6, MCP-1, RANTES and GM-CSF than H. influenzae, but there was no significant difference in the levels of IL-8 induced by both pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae was also unable to invade meningioma cells, but low concentrations of bacteria failed to stimulate cytokine secretion. However, higher concentrations of pneumococci led to cell death. By contrast, only E. coli K1 invaded meningioma cells directly and induced rapid cell death before an inflammatory response could be induced. These data demonstrate that the interactions of different bacterial pathogens with human meningeal cells are distinct, and suggest that different intervention strategies may be needed in order to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial meningitis.",meningitis
"The spectrum of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG-Ab) associated demyelination is evolving. Our case report describes a unique clinical presentation of aseptic meningitis with demyelinating lesions of the brain resembling acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and MOG-Ab seropositivity. A 22-year-old lady presented with history of fever of one week duration followed by headache, vomiting and neck stiffness. She had bilateral papilledema and signs of meningeal irritation. Neuroimaging revealed T2 and FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the right caudate, temporal lobe and left insula with enhancement on gadolinium contrast along with leptomeningeal enhancement. An extensive search for infectious and inflammatory etiology was negative while serum was positive for MOG-Abs tested twice at an interval of 12 days. She showed remarkable clinical-radiological resolution with steroids and has remained symptom free on follow up.",meningitis
"Background: Implanted delivery systems for intrathecal drug administration have become more common in the management of nonmalignant pain. Many postprocedural complications have been described in the literature including infection and headache provoked by position changes. Determining the etiology of a postimplant headache is important particularly when considering the possibility of a life-threatening infection. Case report: We present a patient who underwent placement of an implantable drug delivery system (IDDS) for intractable abdominal pain that developed positional headaches, and significant neck and back pain. Attempted cerebrospinal fluid aspiration reproduced her symptoms and imaging revealed a malpositioned intraspinal catheter tip approximated to the meninges. Revision of the system completely relieved her symptoms. Conclusion: Meningismus from malpositioned catheters is a rare complication that can mimic meningitis but should be considered in the differential for postimplant headaches. Given the increased use of IDDS, it is important to recognize and evaluate postimplant complication and treat it appropriately. We discuss this case report and appropriate work-up and differential diagnosis for meningismus following implant.",meningitis
"Focal arachnoiditis and back pain have been attributed to potentially irritating substances leaking into the spinal canal from the lumbar intervertebral disc or facet joints. Through experimentation this hypothesis was tested: the nucleus pulposus (escaping from the intervertebral disc), lactic acid (from anaerobic glycolysis in the disc), chondroitin sulfate (a component of glycosaminoglycans in the disc), or synovial fluid (from degenerating facet joints) causes inflammation in the meninges if it contacts the dura mater. The test and control substances were injected into the epidural space of monkeys. Twelve weeks later the animals were killed; the dural sac was exposed by total lumbar laminectomy, grossly inspected, and then removed, fixed, sectioned, stained, and examined microscopically. Nucleus pulposus produced significant fibrosus in the arachnoid and epidural spaces; the other substances did not cause fibrosus or inflammation. The study suggests that leakage of nucleus pulposus into the epidural space causes an inflammatory response in the arachnoid and epidural spaces.",meningitis
"Neoplastic meningitis is a diffuse dissemination of tumor cells into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or leptomeninges. It occurs in approximately 5-10% of malignant diseases, most often in breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma or B-cell lymphoma. Symptoms of neoplastic meningitis are head or back pain, cranial nerve palsies, diffuse radicular symptoms or psychiatric disturbances. MRI shows nodular contrast enhancement lining CSF spaces. Positive CSF cytology requires optimal sampling and processing. Treatment must be individually shaped: the CSF dissemination may be treated with intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate or cytarabinoside (Ara-C). Liposomal Ara-C is distributed over the entire CSF space even after lumbar application and maintains cytotoxic levels for at least 2 weeks. Radiotherapy should be applied only to symptomatic solid spinal manifestations or fast progressing cranial nerve palsies. Systemic chemotherapy is needed to control solid manifestations or, in the case of substances entering the CSF, to support intrathecal chemotherapy.",meningitis
"After i.v injection of 50 and 100 mg/kg ceftriaxone in 1 h in dogs with healthy meninges, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations found between minutes 90 and 240 were an average of 0.37 (0.32-0.41) and 1.22 microgram/ml (1.02-1.56), respectively. In dogs with meningitis a dosage of 50 mg/kg yielded high concentrations from minutes 60 to 240: on average, 13.0 microgram/ml (9.9-14.9); 9.9 microgram/ml in the fourth hour. The concentrations obtained in dogs with healthy meninges were 10-100 times higher than the MICs for meningococci and Haemophilus influenzae. In the infected dogs, the concentrations obtained were enough to eliminate virtually all the bacteria responsible for meningitis (except Mycobacterium tuberculosis). In the dogs with healthy meninges, the ratio of the CSF/plasma AUCs was 0.61% after 50 mg/kg, and 1.00% after 100 mg/kg. In the infected dogs, this ratio was 22.4% after 50 mg/kg. Comparison of the ratio of AUCs obtained under ceftriaxone with that under other beta-lactam antibiotics shows the former to be one of the highest.",meningitis
"We report here, we believe for the first time, the primary antiphospholipid syndrome, presenting with fever, meningismus and skin rash. Serology was positive for antiphospholipid antibodies but negative for antinuclear factor. Such presentations, once meningitis has been excluded, should be screened for antiphospholipid antibodies. If serology proves to be positive, anticoagulation for life should be considered to avoid thrombotic episodes and death due to pulmonary embolism.",meningitis
"Twenty-seven ""subdural"" effusions in infants were treated, according to our previously suggested method: a simple external drainage, followed ater one week by an internal peritoneal shunt, if the effusion did not dry up by this time. Daily electrophoresis of the fluid obtained by external drainage has been performed in 20 cases, either until the disappearance of the effusion or until the peritoneal shunting after 7 days. In 8 persistent and in 5 rapidly disappearing effusions, cerebro-spinal fluid was immediately present or appeared during the first week, simultaneously with a lowering of the total protein content. In the other 7 rapidly disappearing effusions, the protein content remained high and a conspicuous plasmatic transsudation was disclosed; the possibility that cerebro-spinal fluid could be present even in some of those last cases is discussed. The fact that some effusions display, from the onset, the characteristics of cerebro-spinal fluid, leads to the question of their subarachnoid rather than subdural localisation. For this reason, we prefer to use the less committed denomination of pericerebral effusions, in which we may distinguish subdural effusions, with or without cerebro-spinal fluid, and subarachnoid effusions. Nevertheless, it is not always easy to establish the pathogenic character of an effusion revealed by CT-scan. Pressure measurements by fontanometry appear to be a useful examination for that purpose.",meningitis
"Depending on its concentration and target site, nitric oxide (NO) is an intracellular messenger or inflammatory mediator. Recent research supports an expanded role for NO in the pathophysiology of neuroinflammatory diseases. Using analytical and pharmacological techniques, the present study identifies NO as a potential inflammatory mediator in experimental meningitis in the rat. Intracisternal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced NO synthesis from the lateral and third ventricle choroid plexi and surface meninges but not from systemic white blood cells, suggesting that meningeal inflammation was restricted to the central nervous system. The time course of NO production revealed at 3 hr lag after intracisternal LPS, followed by a peak of 8 hr and subsequent decrease to baseline 24 hr after LPS dosing. The pharmacological rank order of NO synthase inhibitors in meningeal preparations (NG-aminoarginine > NG-methylarginine approximately aminoguanidine) was slightly different than the rank order for the LPS-stimulated monocyte-macrophage cell line, J774A.1 (NG-aminoarginine approximately NG-methylarginine > aminoguanidine). A prolonged inhibition of NO production was observed in cultured meningeal preparations or J774A.1 cells briefly exposed to and washed free from NO synthase inhibitors. These findings implicate NO as an inflammatory mediator during experimental meningitis, and suggest that NO synthase inhibitors might be potentially useful agents for meningeal inflammation.",meningitis
The authors report two cases of occupation-related anthrax meningitis; one was direct contamination from a diseased animal; the second was due to handling of bone powder imported from India. The pathological pattern of involvement of the meninges and brain is described and discussed.,meningitis
"Three cases of idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis are presented. The diagnosis was based on the CT scan or MRI findings (or both) of thickened enhancing dura. In all cases, meningeal biopsies were performed and microscopic findings were compatible with nonspecific inflammation. All cases presented with subacute and chronic localized headache. Two cases had associated chronic meningitis. One cases presented with a syndrome of multiple cranial nerve involvement (polyneuritis cranialis). Corticosteroids, in the form of prednisolone 60 mg/day, were effective in all cases. Two cases with less severe pachymeningitis received corticosteroids for 2 weeks, then were tapered off in 4 to 6 weeks. A case with extensive lesions needed a long-term low dosage of prednisolone, 5 to 10 mg/day for maintenance therapy. Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis may be related to the Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, the syndrome of polyneuritis cranialis, and multifocal fibrosclerosis.",meningitis
"Cranial pachymeningitis is a poorly understood syndrome, defined by leptomeningeal thickening and typical gadolinium enhanced MRI. The heterogeneous clinical and aetiological features of five patients with both focal and diffuse pachymeningitis are presented. The initial symptoms included headache (n=3), sensory Jackson seizures (n=1), hemiparesis (n=1), episodes of short lasting hemiataxia (n=1), hemihypaesthesia (n=1), aphasia (n=1) and confusion (n=2). MRI scans revealed focal (n=3) or diffuse (n=2) leptomeningeal gadolinium enhancement and cortical swelling (n=4). In addition, one case presented with a subarachnoid and a second with an intracerebral haemorraghe. CSF findings were variable and showed clear lymphomonocytic pleocytosis in 3/5 cases. Infectious diseases were extensively excluded in all cases. Leptomeningeal biopsies of two cases revealed perivascular inflammation, indicating central nervous system vasculitis. In the cases presented, pachymeningitis was caused by primary central nervous system vasculitis (n=2) and rheumatoid arthritis (n=2). In one case, the cause remained unclear.",meningitis
"The authors report a case of IgG4-related hypertrophic pachymeningitis that involved cerebral parenchyma. The mass was removed surgically. Histopathological studies showed diffuse infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells without evidence of Langerhans histiocytes or meningothelial cells. Immunoglobulin G4 was strongly positive on immunohistochemical staining. The Gd-enhanced lesion deep inside brain parenchyma was completely resolved after 3 months of oral corticosteroid medication. A nodular type of hypertrophic pachymeningitis that mimics a meningioma is rare. Nevertheless, preoperative presumption is very important, and immunohistochemical studies for IgG4 may be helpful in the differential diagnosis.",meningitis
"A case of hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis was reported. A 58-year-old female presented the symptoms of headache and vomiting. At the age of 27, she had suffered from tuberculosis. Neurological examination on admission revealed bilateral papilledema, bilateral hearing disturbance, right hypoglossal nerve palsy, ataxic gait, and bilateral intentional tremor. CT scan showed dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles, and compression of the fourth ventricle with marked enhancement of cerebellar tentorium. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was installed bringing about improvement in bilateral papilledema, ataxic gait, and bilateral intentional tremor. One month later, ataxic gait and bilateral intentional tremor recurred, and monoparesis of the left upper extremity developed. MRI demonstrated hypertrophic dura mater in the posterior fossa and compressed cervical spinal cord. Decompressive surgery was performed bringing about remarkable clinical improvement. The pathological specimen showed thickening of the dura mater with concentric layers of dense fibrous tissue infiltrated with plasma cells. A diagnosis of hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis was established. Three years later, the clinical features were found unchanged, but contrast enhancement of cerebellar tentorium had progressed markedly. Hypertrophic pachymeningitis is a uncommon disease. But it should be noted that intracranial involvement is very rare. The etiology, symptomatology, neuroradiology, and treatment are discussed and the literature is reviewed.",meningitis
"Bacterial meningitis is fatal in 5% to 40% of patients and causes neurologic sequelae in up to 30% of survivors. Much has been learned recently about the mechanisms that lead to brain injury during meningitis. Once bacteria have gained access to the central nervous system, their multiplication triggers a complex host response consisting of humoral and cellular immune mediators, reactive oxygen intermediates, matrix-metalloproteinases, and other host-derived factors. Alterations of the cerebral vasculature, with disruption of the blood brain barrier and global and focal ischemia, ultimately lead to functional and structural brain damage. This article reviews current concepts of the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis and emphasizes possible therapeutic strategies to prevent its harmful consequences.",meningitis
"Neoplastic meningitis (NM) is a common problem in neuro-oncology occurring in approximately 5% of all patients with cancer. Notwithstanding frequent focal signs and symptoms in NM, NM is a disease affecting the entire neuraxis and therefore staging and treatment need encompass all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments. Central nervous system (CNS) staging of NM includes contrast enhanced cranial computerized tomography (CE-CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MR-Gd), contrast enhanced spine magnetic resonance imaging (MR-S) or computerized tomographic myelography (CT-M) and radionuclide CSF flow study (FS). Treatment of NM involves involved-field radiotherapy of bulky or symptomatic disease sites and intra-CSF drug therapy. The inclusion of concomitant systemic therapy may benefit patients with NM and may obviate the need for intra-CSF chemotherapy. At present, intra-CSF drug therapy is confined to three chemotherapeutic agents (i.e. methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside and thio-TEPA) administered by a variety of schedules either by intralumbar or intraventricular drug delivery. Although treatment of NM is palliative with an expected median patient survival of 4 to 6 months, it often affords stabilization and protection from further neurologic deterioration in patients with NM. In patients with leukemia or lymphoma, prophylaxis of the CNS is used (utilizing a combination of high-dose systemic chemotherapy and intra-CSF chemotherapy) for patients at high risk as defined by specific tumor-related laboratory markers. Using such a risk-stratified approach, the late occurrence of CNS relapse has decreased dramatically attesting to the value of CNS prophylaxis.",meningitis
"Headache as a cardinal symptom of acute meningitis reflects activation of trigeminal afferents from the meninges. With their perivascular endings, these fibers form the so-called trigeminovascular system (TVS), which releases proinflammatory neuropeptides upon nociceptive stimulation. In the present article, we review a role of the TVS in enhancing the early inflammatory response of bacterial meningitis. Furthermore, we discuss inhibition of neuropeptide release from the TVS using 5HT(1B/D) agonists as a potential new anti-inflammatory treatment strategy for early bacterial meningitis.",meningitis
"Hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is a rare, idiopathic form of granulomatous pachymeningitis. This report describes three cases of hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis and discusses the clinical, radiographic, and pathological findings in these and other reported cases. These lesions typically cause progressive cranial nerve palsies, headaches, and cerebellar dysfunction. They occur in patients of all age groups; the peak incidence is in the sixth decade. Hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is best identified by magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis is established by excluding all other granulomatous and infectious diseases. A dural biopsy is essential to confirm the diagnosis. Hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is initially responsive to steroid therapy, but in most cases it recurs or progresses despite treatment. Surgical excision of granulomas is occasionally necessary to alleviate a mass effect. The long-term outcome remains uncertain for most patients, but progressive disease is usually fatal owing to cranial neuropathies.",meningitis
"Background: Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis (IHCP) is a very infrequent disorder that causes a localized or diffuse thickening of the dura mater. The main clinical features of IHCP at presentation are headache, cranial nerve involvement, ataxia, and seizures. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) have not previously been reported as a main clinical manifestation. We present a case with TIA as the main clinical manifestation and investigated the treatment of the case. Case report: A 33-year-old male complaining of recurrent left hemiparesis for 22 days was admitted into our hospital. The clinical characteristics and CT, MRI, and pathological data were investigated carefully. IHCP was diagnosed and pulse corticosteroid therapy was used to treat this case. Headache, neck pain and recurrent episodes of weakness and numbness in the left limbs were the main clinical manifestations. CT and MRI revealed thickening of the dura along the falx and tentorium. Meningeal biopsy showed diffused thickening of the dura, consisting of collagen in concentric form with inflammatory cell infiltrating and fibrinoid necrosis, confirmed to be dura mater by histopathological examination. Treatment with an antiplatelet drug, low molecular heparin and herbs did not prevent the attacks. Pulse corticosteroid therapy was used and good efficiency was achieved. Conclusions: Recurrent episodes of TIAs can be the main clinical manifestations of IHCP, and pulse corticosteroid therapy was effective.",meningitis
"A case of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) with pachymeningitis is described. The patient had renal, skin, gallbladder and peripheral nervous system involvement, simultaneously with pachymeningitis. Necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescent formation, and necrotizing small vessel vasculitis in the kidney and skin were confirmed by biopsy. A highly elevated titer of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody for myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) was observed. All of the clinical and laboratory abnormalities improved with high-dose pulse and conventional steroid therapy. The literature on central nervous system involvement in MPA and perinuclear-ANCA (p-ANCA)-related vasculitis is reviewed. This case serves to emphasize that pachymeningitis can occur as one of the features of MPA.",meningitis
"Background: Hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is a rare clinical entity characterized by diffuse or localized fibrous thickening of the dura mater. It is well known but rare especially in pediatric population disease of differing origins. The primary (idiopathic) form is diagnosed after excluding other possible etiologies. Similar results from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patients with hypertrophic pachymeningitis and meningiomas may make the diagnosis confusing. Additionally, making a proper diagnosis without histological sampling can be difficult in some cases. Case description: We present a case of an 18-year-old boy diagnosed with hypertrophic pachymeningitis in the area of the hypoglossal canal. The diagnosis was made after a 2-month history of hypoglossal nerve palsy and dysphagia preceded by a middle ear infection. The patient was treated surgically with suspicion of meningioma, but no evidence of a tumor was found during the operation. The postoperative period was uneventful. At the latest check-up, MRI revealed regression of all previously observed pathological changes.",meningitis
"In a study of 25 patients the usefulness of amphotericin B in the control of meningeal infection produced by Coccidioides immitis was established. Initial treatment must be intensive, consisting of intravenous and intraspinally administered amphotericin B. Serologic evaluation of coccidioidal disease provides the most important single criterion for determining the course of the meningeal infection and for estimating the response of the patient to amphotericin B therapy. Final control of coccidioidal meningitis rests upon the prevention of relapse after completion of initial intensive therapy. This requires continued suppressive fungistasis by regular intracisternal injections of amphotericin B at intervals of three to seven days after the patient returns home. Such suppressive cisternal therapy does not replace the initial intensive use of both intravenously and intraspinally administered amphotericin B. This ""local"" type of inhibition of C. immitis is without toxic effect upon the kidney, the red blood cells or the serum potassium values which may be associated with the intravenous administration of amphotericin B. Such intraspinal therapy, by lowering the total intravenous dosage required in the initial phase of treatment, results in a proportionate decrease in the degree of nephrotoxicity produced by amphotericin B. The total intravenous dosage given ordinarily should not exceed 5 grams. The long-term therapeutic plan as outlined permits the development of an adequate immune mechanism that appears essential to complete recovery from coccidioidal meningitis. The importance of such immunity in the recovery process has been previously indicated and confirmed by detailed study of a patient who required immunosuppression for successful homotransplantation of a kidney.",meningitis
"Intracerebral (i.c.) infection of adult mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus can result in acute lethal central nervous system (CNS) disease which is the result of the host's thymus-derived lymphocyte (T cell) response against the virus. Whether the specific effector function of the T cell is that of a cytotoxic cell (Tc) or a delayed-type hypersensitivity cell (Td) is still under debate. We assumed that if Td cells were important in pathogenesis then accessory cells in the brain (specifically, glass-adherent macrophages) might vary with the outcome of i.c. infection. We found that accumulation of macrophages in the brain (washed from meninges and skull cap) appeared to be independent of the severity of the infection (controlled by the mouse strain as well as the strain and dose of virus used). However, differentiation of macrophages was clearly linked to whether or not the infection caused rapid death. In mice that were destined to survive, macrophages became large, extensively vacuolated, and phagocytically active. In lethally-infected mice macrophages were small and had poor phagocytic abilities. At present this dichotomy could be viewed as either a cause or a consequence of disease outcome. However, the data are not inconsistent with the hypothesis that Td lymphocytes may be of primary importance in pathogenesis.",meningitis
"Objective: To evaluate whether concurrent analysis of CSF samples from 2 collection sites (cerebellomedullary cistern [CMC] and lumbar subarachnoid space [LSS]) versus only 1 site could improve the diagnostic sensitivity of CSF analysis for dogs with suspected steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis (SRMA). Animals: 111 client-owned dogs with SRMA diagnosed at 3 veterinary referral hospitals between 2011 and 2017. Procedures: Only dogs with CSF collected from both sites (CMC and LSS) and with no previous history of corticosteroid administration were included. Medical record data and logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with having a total nucleated cell concentration (TNCC) within the reference interval in a CSF sample from 1 collection site. Results: The TNCC was within the reference interval (TNCC < 5 cells/μL) in the CSF sample from 1 collection site for 8 of 111 (7%) dogs and was only slightly high (TNCC, 5 to 9 cells/μL) in the sample from 1 or both sites for 10 (11%) other dogs. For each of these 18 dogs, results for samples from 1 site were consistent with SRMA. The proportion of CSF samples that had a TNCC within the reference interval was comparable between sites. As age increased, so did the risk of having an unremarkable TNCC in the CSF sample from 1 site, albeit only slightly (OR, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.16). Conclusions and clinical relevance: CSF samples from both the CMC and LSS should be analyzed when evaluating dogs with suspected SRMA to improve the chance of detecting a high TNCC.",meningitis
"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are believed to play an essential role in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix macromolecules in the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and their common tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with various meningitides including aseptic, fungal and tuberculous ones. MMP-9 production level in CSF was more increased in subacute meningitis including fungal and tuberculous meningitis than in acute aseptic meningitis and non-inflammatory neurological diseases (NIDs). Enhanced production of MMP-9 was associated with high proteolytic activity detected by gelatin zymography. The MMP-2 and TIMP-1 levels in CSF of subacute meningitis were also higher than those of NIDs. In contrast, the TIMP-2 levels in CSF of either acute aseptic or subacute meningitis were not up-regulated compared with those of NIDs. The central nervous system (CNS) complications (i.e. disturbance of consciousness, psychiatric symptoms, urinary disturbance, etc.) during the course of meningitis showed good correlation with the enhanced production of MMP-9 in CSF. Immunohistochemical studies in tuberculous meningitis demonstrated that the infiltrating mononuclear cells in the meninges were immunoreactive for both MMP-2 and MMP-9. However, the infiltrating mononuclear cells into CNS parenchyma had immunoreactivity for MMP-9, but not for MMP-2. Taken together, those data suggest that MMP-9 in CSF may be a useful marker of encephalitogenecity during the course of subacute meningitis.",meningitis
"Decompression of the perioptic meninges for intractable chronic papilledema was done in a patient with a right parietal temporal glioblastoma multiforme. The patient died 39 days postoperatively. Histologic study of the optic nerves indicated fistulas in the dura compatible with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) egress and maintenance of a normal subarachnoid space around the nerve. Two additional patients with unilateral optic nerve decompression producing bilateral resolution of papilledema were studied. We contend that egress of CSF was the principle mode of action in these three cases. How long the dural fistula remains patent is unknown. Reports in the literature show considerable variation in the effects of optic nerve decompression. Anatomic variation of the intracanalicular subarachnoid space together with differences in underlying pathologic condition, surgical technique, and patient response may explain discrepancies among the results reported.",meningitis
"Hypertrophic chronic pachymeningitis (HCP) is a rare disorder that causes intracranial or spinal thickening of the dura mater. This report describes a patient with progressive HCP in the craniocervical region associated with signs of rheumatic disease. A ventricular-atrial shunt had to be inserted because of increased intracranial pressure. The patient improved after suboccipital craniotomy, C1 to C6 laminectomy, and removal of the thickened dura. Additional therapy with methotrexate stopped progression, which was documented by MRI and PET.",meningitis
"The response of a patient in the form of a painful grimace at the examination of occipital rigidity is considered as an objective positive cervical-mimic symptom. Its informative value increases when diffuse muscular hypertonus and restlessness compound the study and interpretation of the major classic meningeal symptoms. In seven patients, a positive symptom made it possible to connect their state with acute diffuse meningeal pathology prior to a cerebrospinal fluid examination; a negative symptom allowed the exclusion of meningeal pathology in 13 patients which was confirmed by CSF examination. The author failed to find any reported data on this symptom.",meningitis
"Neuropathology of ornithosis encephalitis in an adult man is reported. Lesions were widespread with severe vascular congestion, hyaline thrombi, intense perivascular infiltration by mononucleated cells and microglial reaction in the parenchyma.

"The current view that the migraine aura arises from spasm of the major cerebral arteries and the ensuing headache from extracranial arterial vasodilatation is examined and refuted. It is proposed that the headache is due to stimulation of nociceptive nerve-endings in the walls of meningeal vessels (arterioles, venules, and particularly the dural venous sinuses); and that the aura arises from calibre changes in meningeal vessels that penetrate the outer cortex, resulting in localised inhibition or excitation. It is suggested that there are two types of migraine patients--vasodilators and vasoconstrictors.",meningitis
"Meningeal and cortical biopsies were evaluated in 37 patients (25 men and 12 women; mean age, 54 yr) who had chronic meningitis of an unknown cause between 1985 and 1993 (the era of magnetic resonance imaging). Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast was the most useful diagnostic imaging technique, demonstrating meningeal enhancement in 15 of 32 patients (47%). Only 2 of 32 (6%) computed tomographic scans revealed enhancement. A definitive diagnosis was made in 16 of 41 biopsies (39%), but in cases where enhancement was present on either magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, a diagnosis was obtained in 80% (12 of 15 cases). Only 2 of 22 biopsies (9%) from nonenhancing regions were diagnostic. Although the locations of enhancement were distributed evenly, biopsies through suboccipital and pterional craniotomies gave the highest diagnostic yields (50%). Furthermore, if the biopsies were obtained from enhancing regions, the yield of these two approaches increased to 84 and 100%, respectively. Of 18 cases in which biopsy samples were taken from both the meninges and cortex, only 1 had cortical involvement alone. The meninges were therefore diagnostic in 15 of the 16 definitive diagnostic cases (94%). Second biopsies were necessary in four cases, of which the three biopsies from enhancing regions were diagnostic. The most frequent causes of chronic meningitis were sarcoid (31%) and metastatic adenocarcinoma (25%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",meningitis
"In 1949, Naffziger et al. first described idiopathic intracranial hypertrophic pachymeningitis (IIHP) as an aseptic, diffuse inflammatory disease that causes thickening of the dura mater and often headache and progressive multiple nerve palsies due to fibrous entrapment or ischemic damage of neurovascular structures. Pachymeningeal thickening can be diffuse or nodular. We report two cases of IIHP; one was affected by diffuse IIHP, while the other presented focal IIHP mimicking a convexity meningioma. We examine the differential diagnosis between IIHP and other known causes of hypertrophic pachymeningitis. We also discuss the clinical bases of treatment.",meningitis
"Arachnoiditis has been reported in patients who had received previous epidural injections of anesthetic agents. The purpose of this study was to determine if epidural injections of lidocaine are sufficient to cause arachnoiditis. Four monkeys that received a single epidural injection of lidocaine hydrochloride 1% were compared to four controls that had epidural injections of 0.9% saline. Four dogs that had multiple epidural injections of lidocaine hydrochloride 1% were compared to four controls that had multiple injections of saline. All animals were killed on the eighty-fourth day of the experiment. The dural sac, containing nerve roots and spinal cord, was removed intact from the lumbar spinal canal, fixed, sectioned, stained, and examined microscopically for evidence of arachnoid inflammation and fibrosis. No significant changes were found in the treated animals. Lidocaine hydrochloride 1% injected singly or repeatedly in the epidural space does not appear to be a cause of significant chronic meningeal reaction.",meningitis
"A 57-year-old woman presented with subacute vision loss of first the left, and later the right eye. She was diagnosed with granulomatous polyangiitis with hypertrophic pachymeningitis and optic nerve compression. Her visual acuity could not be permanently restored with immune suppressants alone, so a surgical decompression of the right optic nerve, via a modified cranio-orbitozygomatic pretemporal approach, was performed. Her right eye regained 20/20 vision and has remained stable during 8 months of follow-up.",meningitis
"Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is a rare inflammatory disease with diffused involvement of the dura. Often, the definite diagnosis is made immediately with biopsy and the involved dura is removed surgically. Consequently, extensive preoperative imaging studies usually are not available. We reviewed a case of idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis and collectively summarized the interesting features from the 7 years preceding surgical treatment. These chronologic imaging findings with progressive intracranial involvement included dural thickening, dural mass, sinus thrombosis, and venous congestion constituted comprehensive pictures of idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis. The thickened dura may also at times mimic dural masses, such as en plaque meningioma.",meningitis
"In a review of CT scans of 6,078 patients, 47 patients with well documented leptomeningeal infections were identified; 45 were infants or children. Most of the infections were bacterial; 53% were due to Haemophilus influenzae. The 47 patients were divided into two groups according to whether the initial scan was obtained during the acute illness (group A) or after initial treatment had been completed (group B). The 30 patients in the acute group A had 24 complications: 18 with areas of diminished attenuation in the brain parenchyma and six with dilated ventricles. Eleven patients had initially normal scans, but three of these subsequently developed complications. In group B, the 17 patients had 28 complications: nine with enlarged ventricles; eight with subdural effusion; seven with areas of diminished attenuation; and four with abscess formation. An unusually high percentage (40%) of the patients with areas of diminished attenuation had involvement of the anterior poles of the frontal lobes. Of the patients who showed this predilection for the frontal lobes, 72% had Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. CT was found to be useful in early detection of complications of leptomeningeal infections, as well as in evaluation of the extent of the lesions.",meningitis
"The objective of this study was to examine the clinical findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), pathological features, and treatment experiments of patients with hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis (HCP). The clinical findings, MRI, and pathological appearances of 9 patients with HCP were analyzed retrospectively. The thickened dura mater was markedly enhanced after contrast media injection. The lesion near the brain hemisphere presented long regions of T1- and T2-weighted abnormal signal intensities. The abnormal signal intensities of the brain tissue were decreased significantly. Pathological examination demonstrated chronic inflammation changes, with cerebral dura mater fibrous tissue showing obvious hyperplasia, and the periphery of the blood vessel showing a great quantity of infiltrating phlegmonosis cells. HCP mainly presents headache and paralysis of multiple cranial nerves. The distinctive signs on brain MRIs involve strengthening the signal in the cerebral dura.",meningitis

A case of hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis associated with Sweet's Syndrome is presented. Both entities have been described in association with several other chronic systemic inflammatory diseases and autoimmune conditions. To our knowledge the coexistence between Sweet's Syndrome and hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis has not been reported up to date. We suggest a possible autoimmune or dysimmune mechanism in the pathogenesis of these two entities.,meningitis
"Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis (IHCP) consists of meningeal thickening due to chronic inflammation for which no cause such as infection, specific granulomatous disease, or malignancy is demonstrable. We present a case of IHCP with perifocal brain edema suggesting mass lesion with its magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pathologic findings. A 36-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital in August 2001 with a complaint of motor weakness in her left leg for 1 month. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium revealed enhancement of the thickened dura mater and perifocal edema in the right frontoparietal region suggesting a mass lesion. Histological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed a dense fibrous cellular tissue. There was no obvious inflammatory infiltrate but in some areas between fibrous bundles one or two lymphocytes were detected. According to our knowledge, our patient is the second report in the literature of IHCP with focal edema causing a mass effect.",meningitis
"Hypertrophic pachymeningits is an unusual cause of neurological symptoms and is often secondary to infections, carcinomatosis or inflammatory diseases. It may also be idiopathic. We report a case of pachymeningitis which was manifested primarily by psychosis and visual loss with optic atrophy and destruction of nasal septum. The patient, a 45 year old woman was submitted to extensive investigation without evidence of any underlying disease. A meningeal biopsy was performed and showed a mostly unspecific inflammatory process with extensive fibrosis of the dura and few early stage granulomas. These findings suggest either neurosarcoidosis or idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis.",meningitis
"Hypertrophic pachymeningitis is a chronic inflammatory disease, manifesting as a fibrous thickening of the dura mater. Recently, it was reported that IgG4 is related to the etiology of some diseases, such as pancreatitis. Here, we report a case of hypertrophic pachymeningitis related to infiltration of IgG4 positive plasma cells. A 68-year-old man presented at a nearby hospital with a headache and a low-grade fever. A blood test revealed inflammation, as well as elevation of IgG4 level. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)revealed diffuse thickening of the dura mater, dominantly in the posterior fossa and cerebellar tentorium. The lesion was enhanced significantly with gadolinium(Gd). An open biopsy was performed to determine pathological diagnosis. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed infiltration of inflammatory cells, including plasma cells. The infiltrating cells were positive for the IgG4. Post-operatively, the patient was treated with glucocorticoid, and both the inflammation and patient symptoms were improved. In conclusion, IgG4 is related to the etiology of hypertrophic pachymeningitis and glucocorticoid therapy is effective for this disease.",meningitis
"We describe the clinical and postmortem findings in a 57-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus who presented with neurologic symptoms attributed to stroke. In addition to multiple foci of ischemic necrosis, pathologic examination of the brain showed chronic basal meningitis and vasculitis. No microorganisms were found. The association of meningitis and vasculitis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is unusual and the possibility that these conditions may be due to primary human immunodeficiency virus infection is raised.",meningitis
"Treatment periods for bacterial meningitis are often very long, and often this prolonged treatment is based on the judgment of its effectiveness by the degree of enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we analyzed the contrast MRI in the acute and recovery phases of bacterial meningitis in twelve patients, and graded the contrast level of the subdural space and subarachnoid space separately. While the contrast level of the subarachnoid space increased with time in 4 cases, that of the subdural space increased in 10 cases, and 9 of them revealed a good prognosis without continuation of the treatment. These findings indicate that increased contrast level of the subdural space is common in the recovery phase of bacterial meningitis, and that repetitive MRI investigation is not valuable to determine the duration of treatment.",meningitis
"Serial tests for serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and C4 levels were carried out on 20 patients undergoing microvascular decompression (MVD) for trigeminal neuralgia with interposition of synthetic material (Teflon +/- Dacron). These proteins represent important elements of host defense mechanisms against invading pathogens and their serum levels might be of value in distinguishing bacterial meningitis from tissue reaction to synthetic material. According to post-operative pyrexia, patients were classified into three groups: gr 1 (n = 4): apyrexia, gr 2 (n = 11): pyrexia from 38 degrees C to 39 degrees C, gr 3 (n = 5): pyrexia upper 39 degrees C. Such frequent hyperpyrexia provides a clinical dilemma about meningitis. In 2 patients high CRP levels, 4 days after surgery, indicated the presence of meningitis. In all other patients, CRP levels were decreasing rapidly and normal levels were reached by day 8. All C4 levels were normal values. Measurements of CRP contributed to diagnose common meningitis reactions. These reactions seemed more frequent with Dacron and Teflon than with Teflon alone. Though non significative this difference deserves confirmation by fuller investigations.",meningitis

"Definition: Inflammatory cranial hypertrophic pachymeningitis (ICHP) is a fibrosing inflammatory process that thickens the dura mater. This condition is increasingly reported owing to the use of CT and MRI. Clinical aspects: Chronic headache and cranial neuropathies are the main presentations. Generally the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated and cerebrospinal fluid is inflammatory. Diagnosis: Non-invasive imagery visualizes the thickening of the dura mater that may be focal or diffuse. On MRI diffuse intense enhancement due to intra cranial hypotension must not be confused with ICHP. Focal thickening of the dura may be tumoral. Biopsy of the thickened dura mater is useful for confirming the inflammatory nature of the process and for orienting the etiological diagnosis. ""SECONDARY"" ICHP: ICHP has many causes, infectious and noninfectious. It may be the presenting manifestation of systemic diseases as sarcoïdosis or Wegener's granulomatosis. ""IDIOPATHIC"" ICHP: A diagnosis of exclusion, ICHP might be an isolated intracranial localization of multifocal fibrosis, an ill-defined autoimmune disease. Treatment: A specific treatment is indicated in some cases of secondary ICHP. In most cases treatment relies on corticosteroids an/or immunosuppressive therapy.",meningitis
"The cause of migraine pain is controversial. One recently proposed theory is that migraine pain may originate from inflammation of the meninges, particularly the dural membranes that surround the brain. This theory proposes that, during a migraine, there is an idiopathic activation of trigeminal sensory afferents, resulting in nociceptive transmission to the CNS as well as the release of pro-inflammatory substances in the periphery, particularly the dura. Dural inflammation is thought to lower the nociceptive threshold of dural afferents and facilitate nociceptive transmission to the central nervous system. In the procedure described in this unit, trigeminal sensory afferents are activated by electrically stimulating the trigeminal ganglion. This stimulation causes trigeminal peripheral sensory afferents to depolarize, inflammatory substances to be released from these afferents, and dural inflammation to appear. Dural inflammation is quantified by measuring plasma protein extravasation. The basic protocol describes this model in rats, and the alternate protocol describes the analogous procedure in guinea pigs.",meningitis
"The analysis of morphological, clinical and bacteriological data on 31 deceased children with pneumococcal meningoencephalitis is presented. The lesions observed at early and late stages of the disease are characterized in detail and the tendency of pneumococcal meningoencephalitis to a chronic course in the presence of the viable pathogen is shown. The majority of pneumococcal meningoencephalitides were proved to develop primarily, and in their pathogenesis significant role is played by the lesions of hematoencephalic barrier caused by respiratory viruses. High lethality and frequency of severe residual changes in the children with pneumococcal meningoencephalitis are due to early lesions of choroid plexuses and brain matter. In the experiment on 18 rabbits with their suboccipital challenge with 3 different pneumococcal strains, the influence of the biological properties of the pathogen on the clinical and morphological features of the illness is shown.",meningitis
"Neoplastic meningitis is a result of the spread of malignant cells to the leptomeninges and subarachnoid space and their dissemination within the cerebrospinal fluid. This event occurs in 4%-15% of all patients with solid tumors and represents an important prognostic factor for poor survival. Neoplastic meningitis should be diagnosed in the early stages of disease to prevent important neurological deficits and to provide the most appropriate treatment. Despite new diagnostic approaches developed in recent years, such as positron emission tomography-computed tomography and new biological markers, the combination of magnetic resonance imaging without and with gadolinium enhancement and cytology still has the greatest diagnostic sensitivity. Recently, no new randomized studies comparing intrathecal (i.t.) with systemic treatment have been performed, yet there have been a few small phase II studies and case reports about new molecularly targeted substances whose successful i.t. or systemic application has been reported. Trastuzumab, gefitinib, and sorafenib are examples of possible future treatments for neoplastic meningitis, in order to better individualize therapy thus allowing better outcomes. In this review, we analyze the most recent and interesting developments on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",meningitis
"Thyroid hormone regulates immune functions and has antiinflammatory effects. In promoter assays, the thyroid hormone-activating enzyme, type 2 deiodinase (D2), is highly inducible by the inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-κ B (NF-κB), but it is unknown whether D2 is induced in a similar fashion in vivo during inflammation. We first reexamined the effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on D2 expression and NF-κB activation in the rat and mouse brain using in situ hybridization. In rats, LPS induced very robust D2 expression in normally non-D2-expressing cells in the leptomeninges, adjacent brain blood vessels, and the choroid plexus. These cells were vimentin-positive fibroblasts and expressed the NF-κB activation marker, inhibitor κ B-α mRNA, at 2 hours after injection, before the increase in D2 mRNA. In mice, LPS induced intense D2 expression in the choroid plexus but not in leptomeninges, with an early expression peak at 2 hours. Moderate D2 expression along numerous brain blood vessels appeared later. D2 and NF-κB activation was induced in tanycytes in both species but with a different time course. Enzymatic assays from leptomeningeal and choroid plexus samples revealed exceptionally high D2 activity in LPS-treated rats and Syrian hamsters and moderate but significant increases in mice. These data demonstrate the cell type-specific, highly inducible nature of D2 expression by inflammation, and NF-κB as a possible initiating factor, but also warrant attention for species differences. The results suggest that D2-mediated T₃ production by fibroblasts regulate local inflammatory actions in the leptomeninges, choroid plexus and brain blood vessels, and perhaps also in other organs.",meningitis
"Twenty patients (mean age 52 +/- 12 years, mean weight 75 +/- 15 kg) scheduled for elective myelogram or spinal anaesthesia were enrolled to determine the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of a new expanded spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic, cefpirome (HR-810). A single 2 g intravenous dose of cefpirome was administered as a bolus between 1 and 8 h before lumbar puncture. Blood samples were collected at 15 pre-determined times and a single CSF sample was obtained at the time of lumbar puncture. Serum and CSF cefpirome concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The mean maximal serum concentration of cefpirome was 264 +/- 76 mg/L. A mean steady-state volume of distribution of 20 +/- 4 L, clearance of 7.4 +/- 1.3 L/h, and half-life of 2.5 +/- 0.5 h were determined. Mean CSF concentrations were 0.50 +/- 0.11 mg/L at 1-2 h post dose (n = 4), 0.57 +/- 0.13 mg/L at 2-4 h post dose (n = 4), 0.76 +/- 0.34 mg/L at 4-6 h post dose (n = 7), and 0.83 +/- 0.29 mg/L at 6-8.3 h post dose (n = 5). Blood:brain barrier permeability to cefpirome may not be a limiting factor as CSF concentrations were rapidly attained. Further studies are required to determine the mechanism of cefpirome transport between plasma and CSF.",meningitis
"Presented here is an autopsy case of pachymeningitis cervicalis hypertrophica. A 77-year-old female had the initial symptoms of cervical radiculopathy which terminated in the syndrome of spinal cord transection. Prior to the onset of radiculopathy, the patient had been admitted to the hospital because of a fever and had been shown to have granulomatous sinusitis. Autopsy revealed chronic granulomatous pachymeningitis of the cervical spinal cord, the lesion being mostly restricted to this region. From histopathologic similarities, the extension of sinusitis to cervical pachymeningitis was assumed, but this was not confirmed. An attempt to discover the causative micro-organisms was unsuccessful. The possibility of a limited form of Wegener's granulomatosis could be excluded in view of the absence of true angiitis. Corresponding to the levels of pachymeningitis, the spinal cord was also severely damaged, which was principally due to circulatory disturbance as a result of pachymeningitis.",meningitis
A case of hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis with an unusual and misleading manifestation is reported. CT detected calcified tentorium and superior sagittal sinus.

"Introduction: Positioned anatomically between the spinal epidural space and the intramedullary compartment, the spinal subdural space remains the least common area of localized infection in the central nervous system. Infectious processes of the subdural spinal space include subdural spinal empyema, subdural spinal abscess, infected spinal subdural cyst, and infectious spinal subdural cyst. To date, there has been no systematic review of these entities in children, with the cumulative knowledge of the pathophysiologic, microbiologic, and demographic characteristics of these infections relegated solely to few small series and case reports. Methods: A series of 11 recent cases culled from the collaboration of international authors are presented. In addition, an exhaustive MEDLINE search and manual review of the international literature was performed, identifying a total of 73 cases of spinal subdural infections in patients under the age of 21. Data of interest include the age, sex, signs, and symptoms at presentation, spinal location of infection, presence of spinal dysraphism, and other comorbidities, offending organism, treatment, outcome, and follow-up. Results: Patients ages ranged from 4 weeks to 20 years (mean, 6.5 years). Males outnumbered females by a ratio of 2:1. Over half (53 %) of spinal subdural infections in children were associated with spinal dysraphism or other congenital abnormalities of the spine. The commonest organism to infect the spinal subdural space in children is mycobacterium tuberculosis and the thoracic spinal region was most commonly infected. Conclusions: The disease is usually treated surgically, although a more expectant approach consisting of antibiotics and observation has also been proposed.",meningitis
Signs of meningeal irritation including occipital and cervical pain are common in symptomatic children with the Chiari I malformation. The author reports on two children with Chiari I malformations who presented with a previously undescribed symptom presumably caused by intermittent meningeal irritation: paroxysmal rages. In both cases the rages stopped after decompressive surgery. Evaluation including magnetic resonance imaging should be considered in children with new onset of paroxysmal behavioral disorders.,meningitis
"Hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is an uncommon, fibrosing, inflammatory process that involves the dura mater. The condition is being reported more frequently owing to the use of cranial MRI. The main clinical feature is headache, whereas cranial nerve lesions, cerebellar symptoms, and epileptic seizures occur more rarely. A variety of autoimmune and infectious diseases can result in this condition, which is labeled as idiopathic in the absence of any definite inciting factor. The diagnosis of hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is based on neuroimaging of thickened and enhancing dura mater. It can be defined pathologically on biopsy. A specific treatment is indicated in some cases of secondary hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis. Mostly, treatment relies on corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. This review summarizes the current knowledge on causes, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of this disorder.",meningitis
"Introduction: Pachymeningitis is a fibrous inflammatory process with non-specific symptoms, involving the dura mater. Due to MRI development, diagnosis is both easier and earlier. Current knowledge and key points: We report seven cases and review current literature. Clinical features are headaches and cranial nerve palsies. CSF shows inflammatory changes, while MRI evidences thickening of the dura mater. Disease etiologies in the present study were tuberculosis in two cases, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, lymphoma and dural puncture; in one case only the disease was of unknown origin. The condition of six patients improved with specific treatment. Future prospects and projects: Further MRI development should allow detection of new forms of pachymeningitis and standardization of patients' management through the study of more important series.",meningitis
"Cryptococcal infection of the brain is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients but rarely considered as the differential diagnosis in immunocompetent patients. We present two cases of cryptococcosis involving the brain in immunocompetent patients, which strongly mimicked tuberculous infection in both conventional as well as advanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and the disease was only confirmed after histopathological/cerebrospinal fluid serological study. One patient was a 52-year-old woman, and the second patient was a 23-year-old man. These two cases highlight the need for workup of fungal infections in immunocompetent patients from the tuberculous endemic regions, even when the imaging is highly suspicious of tuberculous lesions.

"We report on a 48-year-old man with idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis (IHCP) manifesting headache, facial pain, and tongue pain with unilateral atrophy, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Although steroid therapy ameliorated these symptoms, they recurred after he developed steroid-induced diabetes mellitus. We treated the patient by lymphocytapheresis (LCP), which resulted in an improvement of his symptoms, a reduction in the CD4 lymphocyte population, a reduction of the CD4/CD8 ratio, and a reduced thickening of the dura mater that lasted for more than 14 months. Results presented here suggest that LCP can be effective in the treatment of IHCP.",meningitis
"A case of CNS listeriosis in a 49-year-old man, previously in good health, is described. The illness showed a biphasic clinical pattern with a prodromal phase characterized by headache, fever and leukocytosis and subsequent development of pontomedullary cranial nerve paresis. The infection was rapidly progressive and fatal. Gram-positive rods, identified as Listeria monocytogenes, were detected in CSF samples only at the end stage of illness. Neuropathological abnormalities consisted of rhombencephalitis and basal meningitis. The major difficulties encountered in the early diagnosis of CNS listeriosis are discussed.",meningitis
"A consecutive series of 30 patients admitted with non-meningococcal meningitis is presented. In all there was a history of preceding head injury. All 30 patients were investigated by direct coronal computed tomography (CT) scan to determine whether or not a site of fracture into a paranasal air sinus could be demonstrated. We postulated that such a fracture would correspond to the site of a dural tear. Direct coronal CT demonstrated a fracture in all patients, and this corresponded to the site of a dural tear at operation in every case in which an operation was carried out (28 out of the 30 patients). We propose that this method of investigation is superior to other techniques that have been, or are currently, employed in this clinical situation.",meningitis
"Aim: To demonstrate the detailed imaging characteristics of early tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and changes over time on standard gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Materials and methods: Contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted, spin-echo MRI images of 26 patients with early TBM were evaluated retrospectively. Meningeal enhancement characteristics were categorized according to distribution and pattern as diffuse, focal, linear, nodular, and mixed. Results: We found that 35% of patients had diffuse meningeal enhancement and 65% of cases had focal meningeal enhancement. There was a predilection for focal meningeal enhancement in basal pial areas, the interpeduncular fossa being the most common. In six patients with diffuse meningeal enhancement admitted to hospital relatively early after the onset of symptoms, the type of meningeal enhancement later changed to the focal form. Conclusion: Reactive diffuse meningeal enhancement occurs in the early period of TBM on contrast medium-enhanced T1-weighted MR images, but later becomes limited to basal areas.",meningitis
"The cases of two patients with idiopathic pachymeningitis hypertrophica that caused progressive paraparesis are presented. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was used to demonstrate this pathological entity in one patient, and myelography was used in the other. Decompressive surgery led to significant neurological improvement. The etiology, diagnosis, and management of this disease is discussed, and the literature is reviewed. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the features of this rare pathological entity on magnetic resonance imaging.",meningitis
"This paper deals with investigations of CNS-inflammations based on 23,338 autopsies in the period from 1967 to 1988. Inflammatory CNS-findings were observed in 210 cases (0.9 per cent). Their etiology was caused bacterially in 66 per cent and viral infections were found in 20 per cent. Additionally multiple sclerosis appeared in 14 per cent of all CNS-inflammations. The meningitis dominated among the bacterial infections and the leukencephalitis and nekrotizing polioencephalitis of Herpes type among the viral inflammations. The histological classification of the nonbacterial inflammations was difficult or impossible in 9 per cent. A clinical diagnosis was established only in 70 per cent of all cases. Especially babies and patients at the age about 60 or 70 were involved.",meningitis
"Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is a rare disorder of diffuse thickening of the cranial or spinal dura mater without an identifiable cause. Most common in adult males, idiopathic HP typically presents with headache with or without varied associated focal neurologic deficits and findings of dural enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging in a linear, nodular, or combined pattern. As it is felt to be an autoimmune disorder, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is typically recommended, and without intervention, the course is usually progressive. The disease can commonly progress with a relapsing remitting course requiring other immune modulators such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or cyclophosphamide for control. Here, we describe a unique case of idiopathic HP as it presented in a pediatric patient and resolved without immunomodulatory therapy.",meningitis
"Aim: To investigate the clinical and radiological features of meningitis with subarachnoid diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity. Materials and methods: The clinical features, laboratory data, and radiological findings, including the number and distribution of subarachnoid DWI hyperintense lesions and other radiological abnormalities, of 18 patients seen at five institutions were evaluated. Results: The patients consisted of eight males and 10 females, whose ages ranged from 4 months to 82 years (median 65 years). Causative organisms were bacteria in 15 patients, including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes. The remaining three were fungal meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. Subarachnoid DWI hyperintense lesions were multiple in 16 of the 18 cases (89%) and predominantly distributed around the frontal lobe in 16 of the 18 cases (89%). In addition to subarachnoid abnormality, subdural empyema, cerebral infarction, and intraventricular empyema were found in 50, 39, and 39%, respectively. Compared with paediatric patients, adult patients with bacterial meningitis tended to have poor prognoses (7/10 versus 1/5; p = 0.1). Conclusion: Both bacterial and fungal meningitis could cause subarachnoid hyperintensity on DWI, predominantly around the frontal lobe. This finding is often associated with poor prognosis in adult bacterial meningitis.",meningitis
"Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus; GBS) is a normal constituent of the intestinal microflora and the major cause of human neonatal meningitis. A single clone, GBS ST-17, is strongly associated with a deadly form of the infection called late-onset disease (LOD), which is characterized by meningitis in infants after the first week of life. The pathophysiology of LOD remains poorly understood, but our epidemiological and histopathological results point to an oral route of infection. Here, we identify a novel ST-17-specific surface-anchored protein that we call hypervirulent GBS adhesin (HvgA), and demonstrate that its expression is required for GBS hypervirulence. GBS strains that express HvgA adhered more efficiently to intestinal epithelial cells, choroid plexus epithelial cells, and microvascular endothelial cells that constitute the blood-brain barrier (BBB), than did strains that do not express HvgA. Heterologous expression of HvgA in nonadhesive bacteria conferred the ability to adhere to intestinal barrier and BBB-constituting cells. In orally inoculated mice, HvgA was required for intestinal colonization and translocation across the intestinal barrier and the BBB, leading to meningitis. In conclusion, HvgA is a critical virulence trait of GBS in the neonatal context and stands as a promising target for the development of novel diagnostic and antibacterial strategies.",meningitis
"A critical evaluation revealed no distinct clinical complex of symptoms related to the radiological picture of chronic adhesive arachnoiditis in the lower lumbar sac in 72 patients. In all cases the arachnoiditis was diagnosed by myelography with water soluble contrast media and, in 16 cases, verified by operation and microscopy. The assumed cause of arachnoiditis was, in more than half of the cases, the combination of myelography and operation in close relation, and, in ten cases, a previous operation.",meningitis
"Neurologic complications, including meningoencephalitis, transverse myelitis, and peripheral neuropathy, have been reported in patients with acute infectious mononucleosis. Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus infections occasionally induce central nervous system lymphoma. On the other hand, central nervous system disease alone associated with Epstein-Barr virus rarely occurs in previously healthy individuals. A 15-year-old girl who developed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis-like disease presenting fever, anuresis, diplopia, and muscle weakness is described here. Clinical and neuroimaging studies led to the diagnosis of encephalomyelitis. Despite the absence of infectious mononucleosis-like symptoms, anti-Epstein-Barr virus antibody titers in serum and cerebrospinal fluid showed the virus reactivation. The copy number of Epstein-Barr virus DNA increased in cerebrospinal fluid but not in peripheral blood. Ganciclovir and repeated methyl-prednisolone pulse therapy resulted in complete resolution. Central nervous system disease on the limited intrathecal reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus in immunocompetent children should be differentiated from acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.",meningitis
"Background: Hypertrophic pachymeningitis is an uncommon disorder that causes a localized or diffuse thickening of the dura mater and has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis, syphilis, Wegener's granulomatosis, tuberculosis, and cancer. Few series of the idiopathic variety have been described, particularly with respect to MRI correlation to clinical outcome and treatment. Objective: To investigate the clinical and laboratory evaluation, course, and treatment of patients with idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis (IHP), to correlate the MRI findings with the clinical course, and to review the literature on IHP. Methods: Retrospective case series of 12 patients (9 men, 3 women), with a mean age of 55 years (range 39 to 88 years), who had IHP by imaging studies, meningeal or orbital biopsy, or both. The clinical features, laboratory evaluation, contrast-enhanced MRI, treatment, and clinical outcome were documented for each case. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.5 years (range 3 months to 16 years). Results: The main clinical features at presentation were headache (11 cases), loss of vision (7 cases), diplopia (4 cases), papilledema (2 cases), other cranial nerve involvement (3 cases), ataxia (2 cases), and seizures (1 case). On the initial MRI, the location of abnormal enhancement of the dura mater correlated with the clinical findings and the sphenoid wing area was affected in all patients. The sedimentation rate was elevated in five cases. The CSF had increased protein in six cases and lymphocytosis in four cases. Biopsy of the dura mater in five cases and the orbital soft tissue in one case showed infiltrates of small mature lymphocytes, plasma cells, and epithelioid histiocytes, but no neoplasia, vasculitis, or infectious agents. Cultures of the CSF and biopsy material remained sterile. Corticosteroid therapy improved the vision in 7 of 8 cases and controlled headache in 10 of 11 cases. Five cases had partial improvement of other neurologic symptoms and signs. Recurrence developed with steroid tapering in six cases. One case had progressive deterioration and died. In four cases methotrexate or azathioprine was added with reduction of the steroid dose. Follow-up MRI performed in 11 patients correlated 80% with the clinical state (p = 0.01). Conclusion: IHP can be suspected on MRI and defined pathologically on biopsy. Untreated, the clinical course is usually marked by severe headache and progressive neurologic deterioration and vision loss. Although initially steroid-responsive, clinical manifestations frequently recur with corticosteroid taper, requiring the addition of immunosuppressive agents in some cases.",meningitis
"A 2-year-old girl presented with a single episode of generalized seizure. Magnetic resonance imaging examination showed an intracranial mass with a diameter of 2.5 cm in the right parieto-occipital region of the cerebrum. These clinicoradiological findings were suggestive of intracranial tumor. Histologically, fibroblastic proliferation of storiform pattern was noted, associated with epithelioid granulomas. The etiological pathogens for the granulomas could not be detected even though investigation of special histochemical staining, immunohistochemical study and DNA analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by polymerase chain reaction technique was performed. On electron microscopic examination, the area appearing as a storiform pattern consisted of fibroblasts showing much dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum and slender tappering cytoplasmic processes without cellular junctional complex. No organisms were identified in the granulomatous area of the lesion. From those findings the diagnosis as idiopathic granulomatous meningoencephalitis was made.",meningitis
"The authors believe that the deficiency of immunoglobulins A in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with arachnoiditis may be explained by an increase in their consumption due to antigenic aggression in relation to the meninges, which results in extremely low values of the circulating immunoglobulins A. The absence of immunoglobulins A in the CSF of patients with cerebral arachnoiditis is one of the components of its pathogenesis owing to impairment of permeability of the blood brain barrier and fixation of antigens in the tissues of the brain and meninges.",meningitis
A method is described that simplifies placement of an Ommaya reservoir for chronic access to the basilar cisterns. This technique is useful in treating coccidioidomycosis and other fungal meningitides.,meningitis
"We report a case of idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis (IHCP) associated with an orbital pseudotumor and granulocytic thyroiditis of unknown origin. The patient suffered from progressive and finally complete loss of visual acuity, as well as from multiple cranial nerve dysfunctions. Medical treatment and radiation therapy were not beneficial. As reported in the literature, the CT and MRI findings of IHCP were non-specific; thus, diagnosis had to be made by exclusion and open biopsy was required. An inflammatory pseudotumor of the orbit is rarely found in patients with IHCP. Thyroiditis has not yet been reported in the context of IHCP. The patient also suffered from anosmia, which is an unusual feature of IHCP.",meningitis
"Hypertrophic pachymeningitis is a rare disorder characterized by meningeal thickness, that can be caused by infection, tumoral infiltration, inflammatory disorders or idiopathic. We report the case of a 40 year-old man that presented with longstanding headache and progressive bilateral visual loss and proptosis. Cranial and orbital magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse dural thickness and bilateral extraconal orbital lesion. Extensive investigation did not reveal any systemic condition. Histopathological study after meningeal and orbital biopsy disclosed a chronic inflammatory process compatible respectively with idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis (IHP) and orbital pseudotumor. This case emphasizes that orbital involvement can occur in IHP and that its early identification is of great importance in order to improve the visual prognosis of this condition.",meningitis
"We describe a 28-year-old man with presumed VKH syndrome, whose presenting symptoms were bilateral impaired vision and headaches. Orbital MR imaging findings included bilateral choroidal and retrobulbar contrast enhancement, while brain findings included white matter abnormalities on FLAIR and leptomeningeal enhancement. Pachymeningeal enhancement has been described previously; herein, we report a patient with VKH syndrome presenting solely with leptomeningeal enhancement. Thus, MR imaging may detect early CNS involvement by VKH disease before the onset of neurologic symptoms.",meningitis
"Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a very rare tumor of increasing incidence. It is often misdiagnosed due to the unspecific presentation or unavailable biopsy, and results in poor prognosis. PCNSL involved the spinal cord is extremely sparse. Here we report a gentleman presented with one-year history of progressive tremor in the left limbs and slight dysarthria as well as three-month history of paraparesis, tinnitus and insomnia. MR images disclosed the swollen cerebellum and cauda equine, with contrast enhancement in both meninges and nerve roots. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed extremely high protein level. Tubercular meningitis was considered and anti-tuberculosis therapy was given for weeks but without relief. With progressive deterioration, the PCNSL was eventually presumed according to positive CSF cytology and exclusion of systemic involvement. However, the patient passed away within days. We then reviewed the current diagnostic methods of PCNSL. The biopsy, as the gold standard for PCNSL diagnosis, is not eligible for all patients suspected PCNSL. The presurgical diagnostic algorithm of PCNSL has been fixed by clinicians and we suggest the early and repeated CSF cytology should be included for definitive diagnosis.",meningitis
"Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is a rare clinical entity characterized by thickening of the dura mater without obvious underlying disease. High-dose steroid therapy is considered to be the first line for idiopathic HP, but half of patients show resistance for steroid therapy and suffer progressive clinical course. We describe low-dose methotrexate (MTX) administration for recurrent and steroid-resistant idiopathic HP resulting in noticeable improvement without severe adverse effects. A 51-year-old Japanese woman with dermatomyositis first presented with right retro-orbital pain caused by dural thickening in the sella and upper clivus involving the right trigeminal nerve, which was diagnosed as idiopathic HP by transsphenoidal biopsy. High-dose methylprednisolone therapy led to remission, and she remained healthy with low-dose dexamethasone. Three years after the initial therapy she presented with right facial nerve and lower cranial nerve palsies caused by diffuse and significant dural thickening in the posterior cranial fossa. Second highdose methylprednisolone therapy was introduced, but the effect was transient and she suffered aspiration pneumonia. Low-dose oral MTX therapy was begun, and her symptoms were almost resolved and dural thickening was remarkably improved without severe adverse effects. Lowdose MTX may be a more appropriate choice for idiopathic HP than steroid administration. Randomized controlled clinical trials are now needed.",meningitis
"Wistar rats were inoculated subcutaneously with either type 1 (HSV1) or type 2 (HSV2) Herpes simplex virus at 5 days of age. Animals were killed in extremis or at the end of the 14-day observation period postinoculation. Acute destructive meningoencephalitis with hemorrhage and leukocytic infiltration was observed in both groups. Polycaryocytes comprised of cells of the internal granular layer of the cerebellum were observed in some animals inoculated with HSV1. These multinucleated cells appeared to be formed by fusion of virus-infected cells, and intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed. Lesions in the leptomeninges were particularly striking in animals inoculated with HSV2. Viral replication in resident cells of the leptomeninges was demonstrated by electron microscopy.",meningitis
"Although it is believed that in the western countries tuberculosis is a disease confined to high-risk groups such as immigrants, we describe four cases of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) in native Dutch children. The inverse relation between the delay in starting therapy and the clinical outcome makes early diagnosis of TBM essential. The often non-specific presenting symptoms and laboratory results, the time-consuming character of cultures and the unfamiliarity of western medical staff with the disease all may contribute to a delay in diagnosis of TBM. We believe that especially gadolinium-enhanced MRI or contrast-enhanced CT can be very helpful in the early diagnosis. Although not specific, hydrocephalus and basal meningeal enhancement on MRI or CT, together with the clinical suspicion can suggest the diagnosis to such an extent that there is enough reason to start antituberculous treatment.",meningitis
"The effects of the subarachnoid injection of ethyl iodophenylundecylate were observed serially in dogs. The results of neurologic examination and cerebrospinal fluid analysis as well as the gross and histologic apppearance of the brain and spinal cord were evaluated. In 8 dogs, progressive nonpurulent leptomeningitis peaked in 5 days and regressed thereafter. The reaction appeared to be related to the physical properties of ethyl iodophenylundecylate.",meningitis
"A male infant, who underwent radical resection of a large glial heterotopia at the nasopharynx at 8 days, developed delayed postoperative bacterial meningitis at 9 months. Neuroradiological examination clearly demonstrated that meningitis had occurred because of the intracranial and extracranial connections, which were scarcely seen in the perioperative period. A transsphenoidal extension of hypothalamic hamartoma is possible because the connection started from the right optic nerve, running through the transsphenoidal canal in the sphenoid bone and terminating at the recurrent mass in the nasopharyngeal region.",meningitis
"To report the clinical, radiological and neuropathological findings of a patient with rheumatoid meningitis. The patient was a 71-year-old Chinese man with a two-year history of rheumatoid arthritis and no other significant medical history, who presented to our hospital recurrent weakness of his left extremities, dysarthria and a continuous bilateral hand tremor. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum examinations were normal apart from a mildly raised serum perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (p-ANCA). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed leptomeningeal enhancement in both frontal and parietal lobes, in addition to several old white matter infarcts. Meningeal biopsy showed numerous infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes within the leptomeninges. The patient responded clinically and radiologically to corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy. The patient subsequently developed herpes zoster over his left chest as a complication of his immunosuppressive treatment. His cyclophosphamide was ceased and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy was commenced, with good clinical response to both the herpes zoster and meningitis. According to the result of the biopsy, aseptic meningitis was considered the MRI results and the patient's clinical history were given, and a diagnosis of rheumatoid meningitis was made. The patient was p-ANCA positive. Although there was no evidence for cerebral vasculitis on biopsy, it remains a possibility that the patient's recurrent minor cerebral infarcts visible on MRI were vasculitic in nature.",meningitis
"The distribution of pathological lesions present in 20 cases of naturally-occurring Streptococcus suis type 2 meningitis and 20 cases of the disease induced experimentally by intravenous or intracisternal inoculation was examined. It was found that the distribution of lesions was similar; mild lesions were present at the choroid plexuses whilst the most dense cellular accumulations were found at sites of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) efflux, such as arachnoid villi and olfactory nerve sheaths. The distribution of changes was considered to reflect the dynamics of CSF flow rather than indicate the site of entry of the organisms into the CSF compartment.",meningitis
"The blood-brain barrier, which is one of the tightest barriers in the body, protects the brain from insults, such as infections. Indeed, only a few of the numerous blood-borne bacteria can cross the blood-brain barrier to cause meningitis. In this Review, we focus on invasive extracellular pathogens, such as Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli, to review the obstacles that bacteria have to overcome in order to invade the meninges from the bloodstream, and the specific skills they have developed to bypass the blood-brain barrier. The medical importance of understanding how these barriers can be circumvented is underlined by the fact that we need to improve drug delivery into the brain.",meningitis
"A patient with idiopathic hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis (HSP) with predominant involvement of the cervical and thoracic dura is reported. Serial magnetic resonance (MR) images detected isolated thickening and ridges of the dura mater. There has been no report describing the serial changes of MR images in idiopathic HSP. According to a review of the English and Japanese literature on idiopathic HSP, the prognosis of patients with positive inflammatory signs is worse than that of those with no inflammatory signs. Idiopathic HSP is a rarely reported disease that can resemble other disorders associated with dural compression. MR imaging can help to differentiate it from other disorders, and enables the diagnosis of the disease in its early stage. The prognosis of idiopathic HSP with positive inflammatory signs may be worse; the authors stress the significance of early surgical treatment.",meningitis
"Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is a very infrequent disorder. Adequate management is still a matter of debate. We describe the use of low-dose pulse methotrexate in treating a 63-year-old woman with idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis. A weekly scheme with subcutaneous methotrexate was tried. Clinical improvement occurred in one week. Total remission of the clinical and neuro-imaging abnormalities was evident 6 months later, with minimal side effects. The patient is in complete remission after one year of follow-up without treatment. Hence, low-dose weekly subcutaneous methotrexate may be safe and effective in inducing complete and sustained remission of this condition. The experience with subcutaneous methotrexate to treat this entity has never been reported.",meningitis
"Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, skin changes (POEMS) syndrome is a rare plasma cell disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) seems to play a pathogenic role. Peripheral neuropathy is the main neurological feature. Cranial pachymeningitis has occasionally been reported, but no histopathological studies have been performed. The authors extensively evaluated the central nervous system MRI in 11 patients (seven men, four women; mean age at diagnosis 54.45 years) with POEMS syndrome. In two patients, meningeal histopathology with staining for VEGF and VEGF receptor was performed, and pachymeningeal involvement characterised at histopathological, immunohistochemical and confocal microscopy levels. Nine patients presented with cranial pachymeningitis. One patient suffered from migraine, and none complained of cranial nerve palsies or visual loss. None showed any MRI signs of spinal pachymeningitis. No correlation was found with disease duration and VEGF serum level. Histopathology showed hyperplasia of meningothelial cells, neovascularisation and obstructive vessel remodelling, without inflammation. VEGF and VEGF receptor were strongly coexpressed on endothelium, smooth-muscle cells of arterioles and meningothelial cells. In conclusion, POEMS patients present a high prevalence of meningeal involvement. The histological changes, different from those present in chronic pachymeningitis of other aetiology, suggest a possible VEGF role in the pathogenesis of the meningeal remodelling.",meningitis
"Norvancomycin is an antibiotic that has been approved for the treatment of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria and has been used in China for more than a decade. However, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of norvancomycin has not been evaluated. The aims of the study were (i) to investigate the pharmacokinetics and CSF penetration of norvancomycin in meningitis and non-meningitis patients and (ii) to recommend favourable dosing regimens in meningitis patients. Twenty adult patients (ten with meningitis and ten without meningitis) requiring norvancomycin treatment were enrolled. All patients received a norvancomycin regimen of 800 mg every 12 h. Blood and CSF samples were consecutively collected up to 12 h after the end of the fourth 60-min infusion. Norvancomycin concentrations both in serum and CSF were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. CSF penetration of norvancomycin was evaluated by calculating the CSF/serum ratio. Mean norvancomycin serum trough levels were 9.9 ± 1.44 µg/mL in patients with meningitis and 10.08 ± 1.12 µg/mL in patients without meningitis (P > 0.05). In addition, norvancomycin penetrated into the inflamed meninges, with mean CSF concentrations of 3.93-10.52 µg/mL and mean CSF/serum ratios of 0.18-0.43, both of which were significantly higher than in patients without meningitis (P <0.05). These results suggest that norvancomycin has higher CSF penetration in patients with meningitis compared with other groups and that norvancomycin is effective in treating patients with purulent meningitis at a comparably low dose.",meningitis
"Enteroviruses (EVs) and human herpesviruses (HHVs) are involved frequently in acute neurological disorders of viral etiology. This study aimed to investigate the incidence of herpes simplex virus types-1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and human enteroviruses (EVs) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Tunisian immunocompetent patients with neuromeningeal disorders. The patients had been hospitalized at the Fattouma Bourguiba University Hospital (Monastir, Tunisia) between September 2007 and June 2009. At least one viral genome was detected in 58 (46%) out of 126 CSF samples collected. Enterovirus was detected in 31 of the positive samples (53.4%), CMV in 20 (34.5%), HSV-1 in 3 (5.2%), HSV-2 in 6 (10.3%), VZV in 4 (6.9%), HHV-6 in 2 (3.4%). More than one viral genome was detected in seven CSF samples, including CMV DNA in six of the samples. The high frequency of enteroviral infections in aseptic meningitis was confirmed. The detection of CMV DNA only suggests a direct role of this virus in the etiology of acute neuromeningeal disorder.",meningitis
"The idiopathic hypertrophic chronic pachymeningitis (IHCP) is a rare disorder characterized by chronic inflammation of the dura mater that there can be associated with resulting neurological deficits from the compression of underlying structures. The etiology of the pathologic process is uncertain and for its diagnosis it is necessary to rule out infectious pathology, diseases of the immune system and other processes, together with the pathological confirmation of the existence of a steril and chronic inflammatory infiltrate of the dura mater, and without evidence of vasculitic sings or malignancy. The IHCP is an infrequent entity. Through Medline last 35 years review we have found 58 cases of IHCP, of which in 43 the affectation was located at intracranial level, being this the most frequent localization, followed by 11 cases where the affectation was located at spinal level and 4 at craniospinal level. We present two clinical cases of IHCP of spinal localization, one at dorsal level and another one at the lumbar level seen in our institution, and we review the clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods, and therapeutic attitude used in the cases found in the literature.",meningitis
"Clinical and histopathologic study of central nervous system (CNS) was performed in 46 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 16 chronic granulocytic leukemia in the blastic phase (CGL). Involvement of the CNS developed in 28 cases. Eighteen patients out of these 28 had neurological symptoms. The frequency of meningeal leukemia depends on the number of lumbar punctures and on the survival time. Post-mortem examination was performed on 45 patients. Eighteen had evidence of CNS leukemic infiltration (18/45 arachnoid, 10/31 dura, 5/45 brain). Hemorrhages are frequent even without CNS involvement (19/27). CNS leukemic infiltration is common enough in AML and CGL to justify agressive diagnostic, therapeutic, and prophylactic measures.",meningitis
"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are capable of degrading components of the basal lamina of cerebral vessels, thereby disrupting the blood-brain barrier and inducing leukocyte recruitment. This study provides comprehensive information regarding the cell specificity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) and their binding tissue inhibitors (TIMP-1, TIMP-2) in the central nervous system during viral and bacterial meningitis. Specifically, we evaluated the immunoreactivity of MMPs and TIMPs in various cell types in brain parenchyma and meninges obtained from autopsy tissues. We found that a higher proportion of endothelial cells were positive for MMP-9 during meningitis when compared to controls. In addition, the immunoreactivity of MMP-9 decreased and the immunoreactivity of TIMP-1 increased in astrocytes upon infection. Furthermore, the results of this study revealed that mononuclear cells were highly immunoreactive for TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and MMP-9 during viral meningitis and that the expression of TIMPs in polymorphonuclear cells was even higher during bacterial meningitis. Taken together the results of this study indicated that the central nervous system resident cells and inflammatory infiltrates contribute to MMPs activity and that the expression patterns vary between cell types and in response to viral and bacterial meningitis.",meningitis
"Study design: This is a case report and review of the literature. Objective: To describe the clinical findings and the surgical treatment of a 28-year-old man with hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis in the thoracic and lumbar region managed by expansive laminoplasty. Summary of background data: Hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis is extremely rare. No description of findings present after expansive laminoplasty for hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis has been reported. Methods: The clinical findings, course, and surgical treatment of a 28-year-old man with a hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis are presented. The patient required expansive laminoplasty. The follow-up period after the surgical procedure was 4.2 years. Results: An unusual etiology of spinal cord compression by thickened dura mater was found with a contrast ring- or crescent-shaped enhancement on gadopentetate magnetic resonance imaging. Spasticity disappeared after the patient underwent expansive laminoplasty. Conclusion: This is the first report of a patient with hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis treated with expansive laminoplasty. Spinal canal decompression and autogenous bone grafting are accepted treatments in the young patient. Careful observation of the patient to watch for local progression is necessary.",meningitis
"Objective In this retrospective study, we aimed to assess frequency, types, and long-term outcome of neurological disease during acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) infection in pediatric patients. Materials and Methods Medical records of patients hospitalized with acute M. pneumoniae infection were reviewed. Possible risk factors were analyzed by uni- and multivariate regression. Patients with neurological symptoms were followed up by expanded disability status score (EDSS) and the cognitive problems in children and adolescents (KOPKJ) scale. Results Out of 89 patients, 22 suffered from neurological symptoms and signs. Neurological disorders were diagnosed in 11 patients: (meningo-) encephalitis (n = 6), aseptic meningitis (n = 3), transverse myelitis (n = 1), and vestibular neuritis (n = 1), 11 patients had nonspecific neurological symptoms and signs. Multivariate logistic regression identified lower respiratory tract symptoms as a negative predictor (odds ratio [OR] = 0.1, p < 0.001), a preexisting immune deficit was associated with a trend for a decreased risk (OR = 0.12, p = 0.058). Long-term follow-up after a median of 5.1 years (range, 0.6-13 years) showed ongoing neurological deficits in the EDSS in 8/18, and in the KOPKJ in 7/17. Conclusion Neurological symptoms occurred in 25% of hospitalized pediatric patients with M. pneumoniae infection. Outcome was often favorable, but significant sequels were reported by 45%.",meningitis
"Streptomycin and combined streptomycin-promizole treatment of miliary and meningeal tuberculosis in infants and children at the Los Angeles Children's Hospital has resulted in clear-cut arrests in seven patients, two of whom had meningitis. A much longer period of observation will be necessary before these patients may be considered cured. These results are incomparably better than the universally fatal outcome of both diseases in a large and unselected group of untreated cases which has been studied. Promizole, and possibly also para-aminosalicylic acid, should be given concurrently with streptomycin. As they are relatively harmless drugs, they should be given to ambulatory patients for a long period of time after arrest of the disease to decrease the likelihood of recurrence. If necessary, streptomycin may be given for longer than 90 days, or in second courses, since combined chemotherapy apparently delays the appearance of streptomycin-resistant strains of tubercle bacilli. The current pessimism with which many pediatricians view miliary and meningeal tuberculosis is unwarranted. Optimism will be rewarded with many more recoveries in the future.",meningitis

"The purpose of this study was to develop a model of bacterial meningitis in young adult rats for assessing the efficacy of antimicrobial agents. Sixty 200- to 300-g male Sprague Dawley CD rats were inoculated intracisternally with 5.78 log10 CFU of a clinical isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae in 5% hog gastric mucin. Inoculated rats were assigned to six groups containing 10 animals each. Group-1 rats served as controls and did not receive antibiotics. Rats of groups 2 to 4 received (subcutaneously every 12 h) cefotaxime (25, 6.25, and 1.56 mg/kg of body weight respectively). Rats of groups 5 and 6 received ampicillin (50 and 12.5 mg/kg respectively) and gentamicin (2.0 and 0.5 mg/kg respectively). Five additional Sprague Dawley CD rats were inoculated with only gastric hog mucin and were assigned to group 7. At postinoculation day 4 all animals were euthanized. Cerebral spinal fluid was collected for culturing. Brains were harvested for histologic examination and culturing. Untreated, infected control (group-1) animals were culture-positive for S. pneumoniae in the brain and cerebral spinal fluid. Of the antibiotic regimens evaluated, only cefotaxime (25 mg/kg) eradicated bacteria from the cerebral spinal fluid and brain. Cefotaxime at 25 or 6.25 mg/kg significantly (P < or = 0.05) decreased the bacterial burden of S. pneumoniae, whereas cefotaxime at 1.56 mg/kg and ampicillin/gentamicin combinations did not. There was histopathological evidence of subacute meningitis in infected rats. No meningitis was observed in rats receiving 25 mg of cefotaxime/kg. This model demonstrates the ability to induce bacterial meningitis with S. pneumoniae in adult rats and the ability to clear infection in 90 to 100% of the animals by administration of cefotaxime at dosages of 6.25 and 25 mg/kg given subcutaneously every 12 h.",meningitis
"The authors describe their experience in 94 cases of dural fluid collections. The correct diagnosis was made in 94%, which is attributed to (a) including radionuclide angiography and both an immediate and a two- to four-hour delayed scan for every patient undergoing brain studies, (b) a high index of suspicion, and (c) simultaneous interpretation of the scan and the skull film. The false-positive rate was 10%, as shown by cerebral angiography.",meningitis
"Hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis (HSP) is a comparatively rare disease characterized by hypertrophic inflammation of the dura mater and clinical symptoms that progress from local pain to myelopathy. The authors report two cases of recurrent HSP and review the English- and Japanese-language literature focusing on the recurrence of HSP. In the first case, a man who presented at 67 years of age with lower-extremity numbness, gait disturbance, and bladder dysfunction experienced two recurrences of HSP during the 11 years of follow up after his initial laminectomy. Both recurrences were successfully treated with laminoplasty and duraplasty. Three years after his last surgical procedure, he was still able to walk with the aid of a walker. In the second case, a man who presented at 62 years of age with lower-extremity numbness and gait disturbance was initially treated successfully with steroid pulse therapy. Approximately 8 months after his initial presentation, his symptoms recurred. He underwent laminoplasty and duraplasty. At the 2.5-year follow-up examination, he had only mild neurological deficits and was still able to walk unaided. To explore possible causes of recurrence, the authors searched the English- and Japanese-language literature for cases of HSP. Of the 96 cases identified, 11 were recurrent. Data on the presence or absence of inflammatory signs were available for 84 patients. A chi-square analysis revealed a significantly increased rate of recurrence for patients who had at least one positive inflammatory sign before surgery (six [20%] recurrent cases of 30) compared with those who had no positive inflammatory signs before surgery (two [3.7%] recurrent cases of 54) (p < 0.05). The authors conclude that HSP recurrence occurs because of active inflammation of the dura before surgery and the influence of chronic inflammation, including residual arachnoiditis.",meningitis
"A case of spinal subarachnoid haemorrhage with progressive spinal cord compression and without any evidence of meningism is described. Spinal block was demonstrated by myelography and computerized tomography and surgical decompression of the subarachnoid blood clot resulted in almost complete recovery. A diagnosis of spinal subarachnoid haemorrhage should be considered in any patient who presents with acute back pain and slowly or rapidly progressive neurological signs in the limbs, even when meningism is absent.",meningitis
"Rheumatoid leptomeningitis is a rare complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We describe a woman with rheumatoid leptomeningitis presenting with acute-onset behavioral changes and consciousness disturbance in the early stage of RA. On fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images or diffusion-weighted images, high-signal-intensity lesions in the subarachnoid spaces of the right frontal lobe were observed. Biopsies of brain tissues and the dura mater located in the right frontal lobe were obtained. On the basis of the findings of histopathological analysis, a diagnosis of necrotizing granulomas involving the leptomeninges consistent with rheumatoid leptomeningitis was made. An early diagnosis of rheumatoid leptomeningitis and immediate initiation of treatment may prevent neurological sequelae.",meningitis
"A case is presented of metastatic dural carcinomatosis associated with a thickened subdural membrane similar to those found in association with posttraumatic chronic subdural hematomas. In this case burr-hole drainage was attempted as a result of findings on computed tomography scanning that suggested a right frontal chronic subdural hematoma. However, no chronic subdural hematoma or effusion was found. The pathology, radiographic findings, and clinical features of this phenomenon are discussed.",meningitis
"A 67-year-old man temporarily complained of hearing loss and earache in the left side. Afterwards, hearing impairment in the right, pharyngalgia, dysphagia, and ipsilateral facial weakness occurred, however, otological treatments did not completely improve these symptoms except facial weakness. On admission neurological examination revealed right cranial nerve palsies(IX, X, XII), and severe orthostatic hypotension was noted one month after admission. Cerebrospinal fluid revealed pleocytosis(16/mm3), and increased protein level(91 mg/dl), but bacterial, and tuberculotic cultures were negative. Cranial and neck magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium administration showed diffuse dural thickening. Autonomic dysfunctions were found in cardiovascular and pupillary systems. Plasma noradrenaline level was normal in supine position but noradrenaline infusion test showed denervation hypersensitivity. Additionally pupils showed hypersensitivity to 1.25% epinephrine. These results suggest that lesions were post-ganglionic afferent fibers in both cardiovascular and pupillary systems. Administration of corticosteroid hormone resulted in dramatic improvement of his clinical symptoms including autonomic dysfunctions. Circulation disorder or infiltration of the inflammatory cells to the autonomic nervous system may be the cause of these dysfunctions in this patient.",meningitis
"Background: Expansile duraplasty is frequently performed during Chiari I decompression. Aseptic and bacterial meningitis are possible complications of this procedure. We sought to compare the rates of meningitis and subsequent need for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion with duraplasty using bovine pericardial (BPC) xenograft and allograft. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 112 patients who underwent Chiari I decompression. All patients underwent duraplasty with either allograft or BPC. Occurrence of postoperative lumbar punctures and associated data were recorded to determine rates of meningitis. Rates of subsequent shunting were also recorded. Results: Overall, 112 patients were included in the study: 30 underwent duraplasty with allograft (27%) and 82 received BPC (73%). A total of 26 patients developed postoperative meningitis (23 cases of chemical meningitis and 3 of bacterial meningitis). Rates of meningitis were higher in patients who received BPC than patients who received allograft (28% vs. 10%, respectively; P = 0.047). The rate of shunting was greater in patients with meningitis compared with patients without meningitis (56.5% vs. 5.75%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Moreover, 13 of the 15 patients (87%) in the BPC cohort who were shunted were found to have meningitis compared with 0 of the 3 shunted patients (0%) in the allograft cohort (P = 0.044). Conclusions: We found that rates of total meningitis were greater in patients who underwent Chiari I decompression and duraplasty with BPC compared with an allograft. The rate of shunting was significantly higher for patients who developed meningitis after decompression compared with patients without meningitis.",meningitis
"A case is described in which the clinical and pathological features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) occurred in a patient with cysticercosis of the central nervous system and associated pachymeningitis of the cervical spinal cord. This is an extremely rare finding. The patient also presented the two symptom complexes more commonly encountered in this condition: focal and generalized epilepsy, and signs of obstructive hydrocephalus. The literature relevant to this case, and to cysticercosis in Great Britain, is briefly reviewed. The case described adds to the concept of motor neurone disease as a syndrome rather than a disease entity of undetermined aetiology.",meningitis
"We undertook a prospective study of the pharmacokinetics of penicillin G (administered intravenously every four hours for a total of b50,000 U per kilogram per day) in the cerebrospinal fluid of children with purulent meningitis. Both the absolute mean cerebrospinal-fluid penicillin concentration (0.8, 0.7 and 0.3 microgram per milliliter) and the percentage of the simultaneous serum penicillin concentration measurable in the cerebrospinal fluid (18.4, 9.9, 4.9 per cent) declined on the first, fifth and 10th days of therapy, respectively. A mean peak cerebrospinal-fluid penicillin concentration of 0.96 micrograms per milliliter was measured at least transiently on all three study days. This pharmacokinetic pattern correlated with the return of cerebrospinal-fluid protein concentration toward normal (P less than 0.01). Penicillin G in the dosage studied is adequate therapy for most streptococcal and meningococcal meningitis in children; an increased dosage may be necessary when the minimal inhibitory concentration of penicillin to the etiologic agent is unusually high.",meningitis
"Objective: This report illustrates the contrast enhancement characteristics on MR imaging of three patients with hypertrophic pachymeningitis and provides an explanation for the observed imaging findings. Conclusion: A differential pattern of enhancement, consisting of intense enhancement of the peripheral margin of the abnormal pachymeninges, was present in all cases. In two patients, much of the remaining abnormal pachymeninges did not enhance at all. On the basis of the microscopic pathology of hypertrophic pachymeningitis, the physiology of normal meningeal enhancement on MR imaging, and the described MR appearance of other pachymeningeal lesions, this differential pattern of enhancement should strongly suggest the diagnosis of hypertrophic pachymeningitis.",meningitis
"Bacterial meningitis is characterized by an inflammation of the meninges and continues to be an important cause of mortality and morbidity. Meningeal cells cover the cerebral surface and are involved in the first interaction between pathogens and the brain. Little is known about the role of meningeal cells and the expression of antimicrobial peptides in the innate immune system. In this study we characterized the expression, secretion and bactericidal properties of rat cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (rCRAMP), a homologue of the human LL-37, in rat meningeal cells after incubation with different bacterial supernatants and the bacterial cell wall components lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN). Using an agar diffusion test, we observed that supernatants from meningeal cells incubated with bacterial supernatants, LPS and PGN showed signs of antimicrobial activity. The inhibition of rCRAMP expression using siRNA reduced the antimicrobial activity of the cell culture supernatants. The expression of rCRAMP in rat meningeal cells involved various signal transduction pathways and was induced by the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. In an experimental model of meningitis, infant rats were intracisternally infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae and rCRAMP was localized in meningeal cells using immunohistochemistry. These results suggest that cathelicidins produced by meningeal cells play an important part in the innate immune response against pathogens in CNS bacterial infections.",meningitis
Idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis is an extremely rare entity. It usually affects cranial meninges. The spinal form is further uncommon and presents as a chronic progressive disease.

Laminectomy and immunosuppressive therapy produced temporary and partial relief. The long term course and relevant literature is reviewed.,meningitis
"Objective: Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is a rare disease, of undetermined pathogenesis, that is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the dura mater. Methods: We encountered six patients with idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis and analyzed their clinical presentations, radiological findings, and treatment. Results: In the six patients, the main manifestations were cranial nerve palsies and headache. Three associations were present, namely optic neuropathy, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, and diabetes insipidus. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was diagnostic, showing intense dural enhancement in a linear or nodular pattern. The responses to corticosteroid therapy were better for patients who exhibited linear, rather than nodular, dural enhancement. For one patient, surgical decompression of the superior orbital fissure provided lasting relief. The course of the disease followed one of three patterns, i.e., sustained remission, relapse with corticosteroid independence, or relapse with corticosteroid dependence. Pulse corticosteroid therapy provided significant relief, while reducing the daily corticosteroid requirement and avoiding side effects, for a corticosteroid-dependent relapsing patient. Conclusion: Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis exhibits varied clinical courses. It is important to prevent irreversible cranial neuropathy during the active phase of the disease, using daily administration of corticosteroids, pulse corticosteroid therapy, or surgical decompression.",meningitis
"A 52-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of nausea, headache, ataxic gait, and memory disturbance. CT scans and MRI showed a markedly enhanced lesion in the dura mater of the posterior fossa, edema in the right cerebellar hemisphere, occlusion of the transverse sinus, and hydrocephalus, suggesting hypertrophic pachymeningitis. Chronic otitis media and mastoiditis were also noted. Subjective complaints diminished after steroid administration. The patient underwent right suboccipital craniectomy and biopsy. The dura mater was markedly thickened, and the cerebellar surface was edematous. Histological examination revealed the thickened dura mater to be infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells of forming lymphatic follicles and accompanied by Langhans giant cells. Inflammatory cells were not found in the cerebellar parenchyma, but were present in the subarachnoid space. Acid-fast stain, PAS and Grocott stain were negative. The cause of the hypertrophic pachymeningitis in this patient, may have been related to the chronic otitis media, but the patient's clinical course suggested that it might represent so-called ""idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis"".",meningitis

"Overall 155 patients with subarachnoidal and parenchymatous hemorrhages from arterial aneurysms, mainly of the anterior part of the circle of Willis, were examined. The intensity of subarachnoidal and parenchymatous hemorrhages varied, with the ++diencephalo-hypothalamic area being largely involved. The volume of intraparenchymatous hemorrhages ranged from 10 to 90 ml. Massive basal SAH was accompanied, in a number of cases, by blood congestion in the fourth ventricle. Correlations were established between the gravity of the health status, clinical cerebral decompensation, and the intensity of hemorrhage to the basal subarachnoidal space and cerebral parenchyma. Three variants of clinical decompensation of the brain were revealed: it ran a torpid course in the majority of cases (64%), it increased dramatically in every fourth patient, and gradually regressed in every 10th patient.",meningitis
"Background Hemicrania continua (HC) is a primary headache syndrome characterized by a unilateral, moderate, continuous headache with exacerbations marked by migrainous and cranial autonomic symptoms. However, clinical phenotypes similar to primary HC may be subtended by several disorders. Case report We report the case of a 62-year-old man experiencing, over the previous year, a headache completely consistent with HC and its absolute responsiveness to indomethacin therapy. Later, the patient developed diplopia caused by sixth cranial nerve palsy ipsilateral to headache. In this frame, clinical, laboratory and neuroimaging characteristics supported the diagnosis of idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis (IHP). Conclusions IHP is a rare fibrosing inflammatory disorder leading to a localized or diffuse dura mater thickening. IHP clinical manifestations are a progressively worsening headache and signs related to cranial nerves involvement and venous sinus thrombosis. Here, we report, for the first time, a HC phenotype subtended by IHP.",meningitis
"Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory infiltration and secondary chronic dysfunction of exocrine glands. Systemic (extraglandular) manifestations of the disease occur in one-third of the patients, including a wide spectrum of peripheral and central neurological disorders. We report a case of subacute afebrile aseptic meningitis (AM) as neurological manifestation of primary SS. The neurological symptomatology presented gradual onset and progression, including diplopia, mild headache, pain and stiffness of the neck. The clinical examination pointed out xerostomia and xerophthalmia. Diagnosis of SS was confirmed by Schirmer's tear test and histopathology of the labial salivary glands. The neurological involvement was highlighted by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain which displayed an increased diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed moderate pleocytosis with prevalence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and increased protein level but no evidence of Ig intrathecal synthesis. A cycle of intravenous steroid therapy led to a complete disappearance of the neurological symptomatology and to normalization of the CSF inflammatory pattern. Given the unusual presentation of this case of AM, which resembled the characteristics of a chronic meningitis rather than those of an acute form, in patients affected by SS we must stress the importance of cephalic symptoms such as headaches and cervical stiffness (even if mild and without fever) as possible signs of central neurological involvement of the disease.",meningitis
"A new model was developed in rabbits for primary amebic meningoencephalitis, a rare disease caused by the free-living ameba, Naegleria fowleri. Naegleria fowleri was cultured in a liquid axenic medium, and then injected intracisternally into New Zealand White rabbits. Inocula of 10(3) or 10(5) trophozoites consistently produced a sanguinopurulent meningitis; duration of survival of rabbits was 57 or 45 hr, respectively. Counts of cells in cerebrospinal fluid were proportional to the size of inoculum used; white blood cell counts ranged from 30 to 1,055 cells/mm3, and red blood cell counts from five to 8,640 cells/mm3. Necropsies revealed severe basilar meningoencephalitis with extensive hemorrhagic necrosis and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration. Trophozoites of N. fowleri were seen within the meningeal exudate and the brain parenchyma. Potential applications of this model include studies of the host response to amebae in the CSF, evaluation of the optimal route of administration of amphotericin B, and in vivo studies of other chemotherapeutic agents that show in vitro efficacy.",meningitis
"To study the role of cell adhesion molecules in the fatal CD8+ T-cell mediated meningitis which is induced by intracerebral infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, the expression of relevant molecules on inflammatory cells and local endothelium was analyzed immunohistochemically. Most inflammatory cells were strongly positive for LFA-1, VLA-4, Pgp-1 and ICAM-1. Expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was upregulated on the endothelial cells in immunocompetent mice, but not in T-cell deficient nude mice. Analysis of mice deficient in either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, revealed that not only was the inflammatory reaction dependent on the presence of CD8+ cells, but these cells also appeared to be required for maximal upregulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on the endothelial cells. These results indicate that virus-specific CD8+ T cells are crucially involved in regulating the inflammatory reaction through effects on endothelial expression of adhesion molecules.",meningitis
"Background: Aseptic meningitis is one of the most infrequent neuropsychiatric manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with multifactorial etiologies including medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, azathioprine, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole, as well as viruses and malignancy. Recurrent aseptic meningitis in SLE is rare, and remains a diagnostic challenge. Methods: We report a unique SLE patient with recurrent (10 episodes), benign (self-limited) lymphocytic aseptic meningitis, which suggests the diagnosis of Mollaret meningitis. There was no prior use of medications known to provoke meningitis. No infectious etiology was identified and chronic meningitis was not observed. The patient had spontaneous resolution of symptoms with no neurologic sequelae. Conclusion: Recurrent benign lymphocytic aseptic meningitis is recognized in this SLE patient. We propose that noninfectious Mollaret meningitis be classified as a feature of neuropsychiatric SLE syndromes.",meningitis
"This study examines the relative risks and benefits of conservative and surgical management of dural tear secondary to middle third facial fracture and ascertains the type of skull and facial injury most often associated with the development of posttraumatic meningitis. Two projects were undertaken. First, the histories of 247 cases of major middle third facial fracture were reviewed with a recent follow-up of those patients who also sustained a dural tear. Second, 280 cases of bacterial meningitis were reviewed and particular attention was given to cases of posttraumatic meningitis. Of the 247 cases of middle third facial fractures studied, 43% (107/247) had evidence of a dural tear; of this group, 76 patients were managed conservatively and 31 patients were managed surgically. In the former group, there were three instances of recurrent cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (CFR). In the surgically managed group, 77% (24/31) sustained surgical complications including two cases of posttraumatic meningitis and 21 cases of neurological deficit. Of the 280 cases of bacterial meningitis, 48 patients had sustained dural tear following trauma. The prognosis for posttraumatic meningitis is considerably better than for other forms of meningitis. The preceding trauma involved the vault of the skull in 90% (43/48) of cases, and discrete middle third facial fracture in one case (2.1%). Posttraumatic meningitis followed a previous operative repair in 15% (7/48) of the patients. The results of this study indicate that dural tear subsequent to middle third facial fractures is a different proposition than dural tear subsequent to direct skull trauma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",meningitis
"Objective and importance: We present a case similar to previously described cases of idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis. However, our patient responded to antituberculous therapy. This raises the possibility that some cases of ""idiopathic"" hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis may represent occult tuberculous disease. Clinical presentation: A 55-year-old woman presented with a right fourth nerve palsy and a 5-month history of headaches. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium revealed thick enhancing dura on the right half of the tentorium cerebelli, with edema of the adjacent midbrain, pons, and cerebral peduncle. Intervention: Open biopsy of the tentorial lesion revealed only dense fibrosis with histiocytic infiltration. An exhaustive search failed to demonstrate an underlying cause. In particular, mycobacterial stains/cultures were negative, there was no granuloma formation, and the chest x-ray was unremarkable. However, because of a strongly positive purified protein-derivative skin test and residence in an area endemic for tuberculosis, the patient was placed on antituberculous medications. Conclusion: The patient's symptoms and signs resolved with antituberculous therapy. Resolution of the tentorial lesion was confirmed by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. We conclude that this case represented occult tuberculous disease. An empiric trial of antituberculous therapy may be warranted in other cases of apparently idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis.",meningitis
"Idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis (IHCP) is a rare clinical entity, characterized by a chronic inflammation causing thickening of the dura. Adequate therapeutic management is still a matter of debate. We present a patient with an IHCP, non-responsive to corticotherapy. Oral methotrexate was introduced (12.5 mg weekly) and total remission was observed after 6 weeks, both clinically and after neuro-imaging. We conclude that methotrexate can be effective and a therapeutical option in patients with IHCP who are resistant to corticotherapy or present major side-effects of chronic corticosteroids use.",meningitis
Intracerebral inoculation of viable Haemophilus somnus resulted in suppurative or fibrino-suppurative meningitis of the brain and spinal cord in rabbits. Multiple fibrin thrombosis complicated with meningitis in the central nervous system was produced by intracerebral inoculation of H. somnus followed by intravenous inoculation with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. The latter reaction may be attributable to a form of Shwartzman reaction.,meningitis
"In this study, the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil was compared with that of cefepime in an experimental rabbit meningitis model against two Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli QK-9 and Klebsiella pneumoniae 1173687). The penetration of ceftaroline into inflamed and uninflamed meninges was also investigated. Both regimens were bactericidal, but ceftaroline fosamil was significantly superior to cefepime against K. pneumoniae and E. coli in this experimental rabbit meningitis model (P < 0.0007 against K. pneumoniae and P < 0.0016 against E. coli). The penetration of ceftaroline was approximately 15% into inflamed meninges and approximately 3% into uninflamed meninges.",meningitis
"We report on a 13-year old girl with severe aplastic anemia and hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis. She was admitted to our hospital with severe headache and vomiting. A computerized tomographic (CT) scan of the brain on the third day of symptoms showed a hyperdense area in the tentorial region. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed iso-intensity in the same tentorial region in T1- and T2-weighted images, and gadolinium enhancement of this region suggested a thickened dura mater. Initially, a diagnosis of subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage was made. Since her platelet count was low (3000/microl) making the patient a poor-risk candidate for surgery, and the area was limited to the dura mater, conservative therapy, including glycerol administration and platelet transfusion, was carried out. Despite clinical improvement 10 days after admission without specific therapy, the iso-intense region on the left side of the tentorial region remained unchanged on MRI. On the other hand, the iso-intense area on the right side of the tentorial region became hyperdense on T1-weighted MRI images and was also enhanced by gadolinium. Cerebrospinal fluid findings were normal except for slightly elevated protein at 62 mg/dl. A diagnosis of hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis of the tentorial dura mater with hemorrhage on the right side was made. Although hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis is a rare disease, it must be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe headache in a case of aplastic anemia.",meningitis
"Despite the high long-term survival in localized prostate cancer, metastatic prostate cancer remains largely incurable even after intensive multimodal therapy. The lethality of advanced disease is driven by the lack of therapeutic regimens capable of generating durable responses in the setting of extreme tumor heterogeneity on the genetic and cell biological levels. Here, we review available prostate cancer model systems, the prostate cancer genome atlas, cellular and functional heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment, tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance, and technological advances focused on disease detection and management. These advances, along with an improved understanding of the adaptive responses to conventional cancer therapies, anti-androgen therapy, and immunotherapy, are catalyzing development of more effective therapeutic strategies for advanced disease. In particular, knowledge of the heterotypic interactions between and coevolution of cancer and host cells in the tumor microenvironment has illuminated novel therapeutic combinations with a strong potential for more durable therapeutic responses and eventual cures for advanced disease. Improved disease management will also benefit from artificial intelligence-based expert decision support systems for proper standard of care, prognostic determinant biomarkers to minimize overtreatment of localized disease, and new standards of care accelerated by next-generation adaptive clinical trials.",prostate cancer
"Knowing the indolent, non-invasive nature of most types of prostate cancer, as well as the simple fact that the disease seems more likely to be associated with age rather than with other factors (50% of men at the age of 50 and 80% at the age of 80 have it [1], with or without presenting any symptom), the big challenge of this clinical entity was to determine severity indicators (so far insufficient) to guide the physician towards an adequate attitude in the clinical setting. The risk of over-diagnosing and over-treating many prostate cancer cases (indicated by all the major European and American studies) is real and poses many question marks. The present paper was meant to deliver new research data and to reset the clinical approach in prostate cancer cases.",prostate cancer
"Genome sequencing and gene expression analyses of prostate tumours have highlighted the potential importance of genetic and epigenetic changes observed in WNT signalling pathway components in prostate tumours - particularly in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. WNT signalling is also important in the prostate tumour microenvironment, in which WNT proteins secreted by the tumour stroma promote resistance to therapy, and in prostate cancer stem or progenitor cells, in which WNT-β-catenin signals promote self-renewal or expansion. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential of inhibitors that target WNT receptor complexes at the cell membrane or that block the interaction of β-catenin with lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 and the androgen receptor, in preventing prostate cancer progression. Some WNT signalling inhibitors are in phase I trials, but they have yet to be tested in patients with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Essential facts Prostate cancer starts in the prostate gland, at the base of the bladder in men. It surrounds the first part of the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder. The prostate gland helps in the production of semen, which is also carried in the urethra. It is the most common cancer in men - one in eight will develop it during their lifetime.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer rates vary substantially by race, ethnicity, and geography. These disparities can be explained by variation in access to screening and treatment, variation in exposure to prostate cancer risk factors, and variation in the underlying biology of prostate carcinogenesis (including genomic propensity of some groups to develop biologically aggressive disease). It is clear that access to screening and access to treatment are critical influencing factors of prostate cancer rates; yet, even among geographically diverse populations with similar access to care (eg, low- and medium-income countries), African descent men have higher prostate cancer rates and poorer prognosis. To date, the proportion of prostate cancer that can be explained by environmental exposures is small, and the effect of these factors across different racial, ethnic, or geographical populations is poorly understood. In contrast, prostate cancer has one of the highest heritabilities of all major cancers. Numerous genetic susceptibility markers have been identified from family-based studies, candidate gene association studies, and genome-wide association studies. Some prostate cancer loci, including the risk loci found at chromosome 8q24, have consistent effects in all groups studied to date. However, replication of many susceptibility loci across race, ethnicity, and geography remains limited, and additional studies in certain populations (particularly in men of African descent) are needed to better understand the underlying genetic basis of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Advanced prostate cancer includes a wide spectrum of disease ranging from hormone naïve or hormone sensitive to castration resistant, both containing populations of men who have demonstrable metastatic and non-metastatic states. The mainstay of treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, recent level 1 evidence demonstrates that the addition of chemotherapy or abiraterone acetate to ADT results in significant survival advantage as compared with ADT alone. Furthermore, in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (M0 CRPC), two second-generation anti-androgens, apalutamide and enzalutamide, when used in combination with ADT, have demonstrated a significant benefit in metastasis-free survival. Here, we review the most recent studies leading to these significant changes in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Approximately 15% of patients with prostate cancer are diagnosed with high-risk disease. However, the current definitions of high-risk prostate cancer include a heterogeneous group of patients with a range of prognoses. Some have the potential to progress to a lethal phenotype that can be fatal, while others can be cured with treatment of the primary tumour alone. The optimal management of this patient subgroup is evolving. A refined classification scheme is needed to enable the early and accurate identification of high-risk disease so that more-effective treatment paradigms can be developed. We discuss several principles established from clinical trials, and highlight other questions that remain unanswered. This Review critically evaluates the existing literature focused on defining the high-risk population, the management of patients with high-risk prostate cancer, and future directions to optimize care.",prostate cancer
"The androgen receptor (AR), ligand-induced transcription factor, is expressed in primary prostate cancer and in metastases. AR regulates multiple cellular events, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and differentiation. Its expression in prostate cancer cells is regulated by steroid and peptide hormones. AR downregulation by various compounds which are contained in fruits and vegetables is considered a chemopreventive strategy for prostate cancer. There is a bidirectional interaction between the AR and micro-RNA (miRNA) in prostate cancer; androgens may upregulate or downregulate the selected miRNA, whereas the AR itself is a target of miRNA. AR mutations have been discovered in prostate cancer, and their incidence may increase with tumor progression. AR mutations and increased expression of selected coactivators contribute to the acquisition of agonistic properties of anti-androgens. Expression of some of the coactivators is enhanced during androgen ablation. AR activity is regulated by peptides such as cytokines or growth factors which reduce the concentration of androgen required for maximal stimulation of the receptor. In prostate cancer, variant ARs which exhibit constitutive activity were detected. Novel therapies which interfere with intracrine synthesis of androgens or inhibit nuclear translocation of the AR have been introduced in the clinic.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with a variable natural history. Therefore, optimal management remains challenging. While many men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer may be candidates for active surveillance, there are others who will benefit from aggressive local therapy. Radical prostatectomy is associated with improvements in cancer-specific mortality, metastasis-free survival, and need for palliative treatments when compared with observation in several randomized controlled trials. Additionally, radical prostatectomy may have some oncologic benefit over radiation therapy. All aggressive therapy for prostate cancer negatively impacts erectile function and urinary continence. The decision for which treatment modality to pursue should incorporate shared decision making and consider cancer risk and severity in addition to patient preferences.",prostate cancer
"During the past decade, treatment strategies for patients with advanced prostate cancer involving stage IV (T4N0M0, N1M0 or M1) hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and recurrent prostate cancer after treatment with curative intent, as well as castration-resistant prostate cancer, have extensively evolved with the introduction and approval of several new agents including sipuleucel-T, radium-223, abiraterone, enzalutamide and cabazitaxel, all of which have shown significant improvement on overall survival. The appropriate use of these agents and the proper sequencing of these agents are still not optimized. The results of several recently reported randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies could assist in developing a treatment strategy for advanced prostate cancer. In addition, prospective studies and molecular characterization of tumors to address these issues are ongoing.",prostate cancer
"The term ""oligometastatic prostate cancer"" refers to a heterogeneous group of disease states currently defined solely on the basis of clinical features. Oligorecurrent disease, de novo oligometastases, and oligoprogressive disease likely have unique biologic underpinnings and natural histories. Evidence suggesting the existence of a subset of patients who harbor prostate cancer with limited metastatic potential currently includes disparate and overwhelmingly retrospective reports. Nevertheless, emerging prospective data have corroborated the ""better-than-expected,"" retrospectively observed outcomes, particularly in the setting of oligorecurrent prostate cancer. Improved functional imaging with prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted strategies may enhance the identification of patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer in the short term. In the long term, refinement of the oligometastatic case definition likely will require biologic risk-stratification schemes. To determine optimal treatment strategies and identify patients most likely to benefit from metastasis-directed therapy, future efforts should focus on conducting high-quality, prospective trials with much-needed molecular correlative studies.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer (PC) is a major disease that affects men's health worldwide. It is the second most common form of cancer in men, surpassed only by nonmelanoma skin cancers such as basal and squamous cell carcinomas. Diagnostic strategies with population screening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been surrounded with controversy and debated intensively ever since the PSA protein was first purified in 1979 by Wang et al. At the same time, advances in diagnostic imaging, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy have increased the opportunity to effectively diagnose, treat, and manage PC. Given the sheer burden of PC disease in Denmark and worldwide, new and innovative strategies for cancer diagnosis and care are needed. This article is a short review of current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the care and management of prostate cancer in Denmark.",prostate cancer
"Current tendencies in the treatment course of prostate cancer patients increase the need for reliable biomarkers that help in decision-making in a challenging clinical setting. Within the last decade, several novel biomarkers have been introduced. In the following comprehensive review article, we focus on diagnostic (PHI®, 4K score, SelectMDx®, ConfirmMDx®, PCA3, MiPS, ExoDX®, mpMRI) and prognostic (OncotypeDX GPS®, Prolaris®, ProMark®, DNA-ploidy, Decipher®) biomarkers that are in widespread clinical use and are supported by evidence. Hereby, we focus on multiple clinical situations in which innovative biomarkers may guide decision-making in prostate cancer therapy. In addition, we describe novel liquid biopsy approaches (circulating tumor cells, cell-free DNA) that have been described as predictive biomarkers in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and might support an individual patient-centred oncological approach in the nearer future.",prostate cancer
"This chapter provides a brief overview of prostate cancer statistics, grading, diagnosis and treatment strategies that are discussed in more detail in the subsequent chapters of this book and the companion book titled ""Clinical Molecular and Diagnostic Imaging of Prostate Cancer and Treatment Strategies"". It also points to websites that provide additional useful information for patients affected by prostate cancer and for students and teachers to obtain practical and updated information on research, new diagnostic modalities and new therapies including new updated clinical trials. Three sections are focused on overview of prostate cancer statistics; overview of detection, diagnosis, stages and grading of prostate cancer; and treatment possibilities and options.",prostate cancer
"Despite significant progress in early detection and improved treatment modalities prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in American men which results in about 30,000 deaths per year in the USA. An aggressive phenotype leading to 2.58% risk of dying from prostate cancer still exists and immunotherapy has offered new possibilities to treat metastatic prostate cancer that cannot be treated by other modalities. Cancer immunotherapy is a rapidly growing field of research aimed at identifying biomarkers in immunodiagnosis and to develop new therapies by enabling the immune system to detect and destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy falls into three different broad categories which are checkpoint inhibitors, cytokines, and vaccine immunotherapy. While immunotherapy to treat prostate cancer is still limited progress has been made; for treatment of advanced prostate cancer sipuleucel-T has been administered to patients in personalized doses to destroy prostate cancer cells which is promising and invites further research to determine immunotherapies for advanced prostate cancer. Antibody-based targeted immunotherapy and dendritic-cell-based vaccination are among the therapies that are currently being evaluated as promising approaches to treat prostate cancer. Combination immunotherapies include prostate cancer vaccines and radiotherapy for castration resistant prostate cancer. Microbial vectors for prostate cancer immunotherapy have been developed and bacterial strains have been engineered to express cancer-specific antigens, cytokines, and prodrug-converting cytokines. These approaches are addressed in the present review.",prostate cancer
"The treatment of prostate cancer with remote metastases has advanced greatly in recent years. Treatment options are dependent on the extent of the metastases, the patient’s general condition and wishes, and the treatment response. We present an overview of the latest options for systemic treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer, based on availability in Norway.",prostate cancer
"The population of patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer are a large and heterogeneous group with highly variable prognoses, which present a challenge to efforts to develop standardized treatment recommendations. New classification systems have been proposed that modify the existing National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and that subdivide men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer into favorable and unfavorable subgroups. This review will examine the changing landscape of intermediate-risk prostate cancer and the effects on treatment decisions that may result from this new classification. The literature provides evidence that men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer have prostate cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality rates similar to the rates in patients with low-risk prostate cancer and thus may be candidates for active surveillance, dose-escalated radiation therapy without short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), or, interestingly, standard-dose radiation therapy plus short-term ADT. Conversely, patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer have prostate cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality rates similar to the rates in patients with high-risk prostate cancer. These patients would not be candidates for active surveillance and may in fact require long-term ADT in addition to standard-dose or dose-escalated radiation therapy instead of 4 to 6 months of ADT.",prostate cancer
"Oligometastatic prostate cancer represents an intermediate state between a localized tumor and widespread metastatic disease. Its specific clinical features suggest the existence of a distinct biology which still needs to be elucidated. New imaging techniques like prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET scans have shown to perform well in the staging and restaging of this category of patients, at different phases of disease evolution. Despite limited prospective evidence, metastasis-directed therapies (MDT) are emerging as valid treatment options able to postpone systemic therapies and probably improve survival outcome. The aim of this review is to shed light on the clinical scenario of prostate cancer patients with limited metastatic disease burden and highlight the role of MDT strategies in this setting.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: This overview examines the rationale for dietary interventions for prostate cancer by summarizing the current evidence base and biological mechanisms for the involvement of diet in disease incidence and progression. Recent findings: Recent data have further solidified the association between insulin resistance and prostate cancer with the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance. Data also show that periprostatic adipocytes promote extracapsular extension of prostate cancer through chemokines, thereby providing a mechanistic explanation for the association observed between obesity and high-grade cancer. Regarding therapeutics, hyperinsulinemia may be the cause of resistance to phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitors in the treatment of prostate cancer, leading to new investigations combining these drugs with ketogenic diets. Summary: Given the recently available data regarding insulin resistance and adipokine influence on prostate cancer, dietary strategies targeting metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and obesity should be further explored. In macronutrient-focused therapies, low carbohydrate/ketogenic diets should be favored in such interventions because of their superior impact on weight loss and metabolic parameters and encouraging clinical data. Micronutrients, including the carotenoid lycopene which is found in highest concentrations in tomatoes, may also play a role in prostate cancer prevention and prognosis through complementary metabolic mechanisms. The interplay between genetics, diet, and prostate cancer is an area of emerging focus that might help optimize therapeutic dietary response in the future through personalization.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a paradigm tumor model for heterogeneity in almost every sense. Its clinical, spatial, and morphological heterogeneity divided by the high-level molecular genetic diversity outline the complexity of this disease in the clinical and research settings. In this review, we summarize the main aspects of prostate cancer heterogeneity at different levels, with special attention given to the spatial heterogeneity within the prostate, and to the standard morphological heterogeneity, with respect to tumor grading and modern classifications. We also cover the complex issue of molecular genetic heterogeneity, discussing it in the context of the current evidence of the genetic characterization of prostate carcinoma; the interpatient, intertumoral (multifocal disease), and intratumoral heterogeneity; tumor clonality; and metastatic disease. Clinical and research implications are summarized and serve to address the most pertinent problems stemming from the extreme heterogeneity of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: The role of testosterone in the development of prostate cancer and the safety of testosterone therapy (TTh) after prostate cancer treatment, or in the setting of active surveillance, remains controversial. There are many concerns about using TTh in men, particularly those with a history of prostate cancer, ranging from a possible increased risk of cardiovascular disease to cancer progression or recurrence. With many prostate cancer patients living longer, and hypogonadism having significant morbidity, much care must go into the decision to treat. Here, we review the literature investigating the effects of testosterone on the prostate as well as the efficacy and safety of exogenous testosterone in men with a history of prostate cancer. Recent findings: The improvement in quality of life with TTh is well studied and understood, while the argument for significantly increased risk of cancer or other adverse effects is much less robust. Neither increased rates of prostate cancer, cancer recurrence, or cardiovascular risk have been well established. In men with high-risk prostate cancer, evidence in the setting of TTh is very limited, and TTh should be used with caution. The fears of TTh causing or worsening prostate cancer do not appear to be well supported by available data. Though more studies are needed to definitively determine the safety of TTh in men with prostate cancer, consideration should be given to treatment of hypogonadal men with a history of CaP.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a disease that presents a wide spectrum from low aggressiveness localized to disseminated cancer. Locally advanced prostate cancer (LAPC) is a particularly difficult to manage phase of this spectrum. Objectives: We review the definition, diagnosis and treatment of this phase of the disease. Methods: We performed a non systematic literature review of the most relevant features of this pathology. Results: LAPC is more aggressive than organ confined disease. Its clinical diagnosis is not always easy. Local treatment, in spite of being aggressive with potential sequelae, seems to be advantageous in terms of patient survival. Conclusions: Prostate cancer local staging is currently based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). Local radical treatment with surgery or radiotherapy, with probable addition of systemic treatment, offers promising results for disease control and quality of life improvement.",prostate cancer
"Introduction: The 2019 Coffey-Holden Prostate Cancer Academy (CHPCA) Meeting, ""Prostate Cancer Research: The Next Generation,"" was held 20 to 23 June, 2019, in Los Angeles, California. Methods: The CHPCA Meeting is an annual conference held by the Prostate Cancer Foundation, that is uniquely structured to stimulate intense discussion surrounding topics most critical to accelerating prostate cancer research and the discovery of new life-extending treatments for patients. The 7th Annual CHPCA Meeting was attended by 86 investigators and concentrated on many of the most promising new treatment opportunities and next-generation research technologies. Results: The topics of focus at the meeting included: new treatment strategies and novel agents for targeted therapies and precision medicine, new treatment strategies that may synergize with checkpoint immunotherapy, next-generation technologies that visualize tumor microenvironment (TME) and molecular pathology in situ, multi-omics and tumor heterogeneity using single cells, 3D and TME models, and the role of extracellular vesicles in cancer and their potential as biomarkers. Discussion: This meeting report provides a comprehensive summary of the talks and discussions held at the 2019 CHPCA Meeting, for the purpose of globally disseminating this knowledge and ultimately accelerating new treatments and diagnostics for patients with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Its incidence increases with age. New treatment options have been introduced and there is a clear trend to more aggressive treatment in newly diagnosed metastatic disease. While prolonged survival of patients has been achieved, the new expensive drugs are associated with an increased burden on the healthcare system. Meanwhile, similarly to other tumour entities, there is a pool of different drugs available with comparable oncologic efficacy, but different side-effects. Effective diagnostic investigation and treatment decisions require additional factors, above and beyond clinical parameters, for a more individual treatment approach. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPCA), there are promising molecular markers for treatment decisions. In metastatic disease, liquid biopsies and next generation sequencing of metastatic biopsies allow for genetic analysis. These will provide more insight into tumour dynamics and allow for patient selection. This review concentrates on molecular markers in CRPCA.",prostate cancer
"Objective: To critically analyze the available evidence regarding the incidence, etiopathogenesis, and management of prostate cancer (CaP) in transgender women. In addition, this article aims to present a recent case report of a transgender woman with a unique presentation at the author's institution. Materials and methods: An electronic nonsystematic literature search was performed to identify pertinent studies. PubMed search engine was queried by using the following search terms: ""prostate cancer,"" ""male to female transsexual,"" ""transgender patient,"" ""androgen + prostate cancer,"" ""estrogen therapy + prostate cancer,"" and ""health care barrier."" In addition, a clinical case managed at our institution was reviewed and critically discussed. Results: Including our case, there have been only 10 documented cases of CaP in transgender women. Additionally, an emerging body of literature has questioned the role of androgens in the development of CaP and suggested that estrogen therapy may not be as protective as initially thought. Therefore, the current evidence suggests that the transgender woman should be screened for CaP the same as a nontransgender men. Barriers to care in the transgender female population include accessing resources, medical knowledge deficits, ethics of transition-related medical care, diagnosing vs pathologizing transgender patients, financial restrictions of the patient, and health system determinants. Conclusion: Although rare, CaP in transgender women has been documented. Both the mechanism and the impact of receiving a bilateral orchiectomy on disease development are unclear. Future study is needed to examine these factors, and to further shape the treatment and screening regimen for these patients.",prostate cancer
"Despite extensive clinical research of different chemotherapy agents for more than three decades, the role of chemotherapy in prostate cancer was only established in 2004, after demonstrating a survival benefit with docetaxel in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 6 years later, second-line chemotherapy using cabazitaxel, after disease progression on docetaxel, demonstrated an additional survival improvement. Recently, docetaxel given alongside standard hormonal therapy in newly diagnosed advanced prostate cancer was found to lead to significantly improved patient outcomes. This article aims to cover the role of chemotherapy in prostate cancer and the latest developments.",prostate cancer
"The heterogeneity of prostate cancer has made imaging modalities of crucial importance in this disease. Accurate diagnosis and staging of the volume and extent of disease, especially in advanced and metastatic prostate cancer, can help to tailor the timing and modalities of treatment. While MRI has been effective in the detection of significant prostate cancer, its use in the identification and quantification of extraprostatic disease is limited. This gap is now being filled by PSMA PET. PSMA PET scans have now been shown to have a role in all stages in the prostate cancer journey. Emerging evidence has shown its promise in primary staging, restaging and theranostics. In this paper, we review the evidence for the use of PSMA PET in the various stages of prostate cancer, from initial diagnosis to advanced metastatic disease where other systemic treatments have failed.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in males worldwide and the commonest cancer in males in the UK. The recent updates on the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer were discussed at a multidisciplinary day event organized by the British Institute of Radiology and held in London in November 2016. This day covered the use of the prostate-specific antigen biomarker and of advanced imaging techniques such as multiparametric and whole-body MRI, choline positron emission tomography/CT and gallium-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen for the detection of prostate cancer. In addition, the results of several trials assessing the management of the disease were discussed, in particular the Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial and Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment trials which evaluated the gain of intervention vs observation, and four randomized controlled trials comparing hypofractionated and standard radiotherapy regimen. Further to this event, this commentary highlights the topical issues relating to recently published guidelines and to trials for the management of prostate cancer where these were discussed.",prostate cancer
"Endocrine therapy for prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy and antiandrogens, which are the standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Endocrine therapy is effective in most prostate cancers, but as treatment continues, most patients eventually experience resistant to endocrine therapy and disease progression. Patients in this state are said to have castration-resistant prostate cancer. This review outlines the types of endocrine therapy for prostate cancer, the physiological mechanisms of endocrine therapy, its clinical use in Japan and the United States and Europe, new endocrine therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer, and the side effects to be noted in endocrine therapy.",prostate cancer
"Key issues for prostate cancer patients are the detection of recurrent disease and the treatment of metastasized cancer. Early detection is a major challenge for all conventional imaging modalities. Furthermore, therapy of patients with hormone-resistant tumor lesions presents a major clinical challenge. Because the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is frequently overexpressed in prostate cancer, several PSMA-targeting molecules are under development to detect and treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). mCRPC represents a situation where cure is no longer achievable and novel therapeutic approaches for palliation and increase of survival are needed. In this article, we discuss the recent development for noninvasive detection of recurrent disease and therapy of mCRPC with corresponding PSMA-targeted radioligands.",prostate cancer
"Updates to the NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer include further refinements in taking a family history, new recommendations for germline and somatic testing, use of androgen receptor blockers for nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, advice regarding intermittent versus continuous androgen deprivation therapy, and consideration of whether to treat the primary tumor in men diagnosed with de novo metastatic prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a public health concern as it currently represents the most frequent malignancy in men in Europe. Progression of this hormone-dependent cancer is driven by androgens. Thus, the most common treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer consists in an androgen ablation by castration therapy. However, the majority of patients relapses and develops a castration-resistant prostate cancer. This failure of androgen deprivation is related to the emergence of mutant and splice variants of the androgen receptor. Indeed, androgen receptor variants are ligand-independent, constitutively active and thus able to induce resistance to castration. This review focuses on AR variants signaling pathways and their role in resistance to castration and prostate cancer progression.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: Compared to urban populations, rural populations rank poorly on numerous health indicators, including cancer outcomes. We examined the relationship of rural residence with stage and treatment among patients with prostate cancer, the second most common malignancy in men. Materials and methods: Using the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry we identified all men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2009 and 2015. Patients were classified as residing in a rural area, a large town or an urban area using the Rural-Urban Commuting Area classification. Our primary outcomes included indicators of prostate cancer treatment and treatment types but we also examined disease stage and mortality. We used the chi-square tests to assess differences between groups and estimated multivariable logistic regression models to assess the association between rural residence and treatment. Results: We identified 51,024 men diagnosed with localized or metastatic prostate cancer between 2009 and 2015. The overall incidence of prostate cancer decreased during the study period from 416 to 304/100,000 men while the incidence of metastatic disease increased from 336 to 538/100,000. Rural residents were less likely to undergo treatment than urban residents even when stratified by low, intermediate and high risk disease (aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.91; aOR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.89; and aOR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.89, respectively). Rural status did not affect the receipt of radiation therapy compared to other treatment types. Conclusions: Prostate cancer treatment differs between urban and rural residents. Rural residents are less likely to receive treatment even when stratified by disease risk.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the second-most widespread cancer in men worldwide. Treatment choices are limited to prostatectomy, hormonal therapy, and radiotherapy, which commonly have deleterious side effects and vary in their efficacy, depending on the stage of the disease. Among novel experimental strategies, gene therapy holds great promise for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, its use is currently limited by the lack of delivery systems able to selectively deliver the therapeutic genes to the tumors after intravenous administration without major drawbacks. To remediate this problem, a wide range of nonviral delivery approaches have been developed to specifically deliver DNA-based therapeutic agents to their site of action. This review provides an overview of the various nonviral delivery strategies and gene therapy concepts used to deliver therapeutic DNA to prostate cancer cells, and focuses on recent therapeutic advances made so far.",prostate cancer
"As a result of the growing incidence of cancer as well as increased survival of patients, an increasing number of people are living longer with cancer. In recent years, research has shown that physical activity not only protects against a number of cancer types, but is also valuable for patients undergoing cancer treatment and during the rehabilitation phase, as well as for improving function and quality of life. Regular physical activity is an effective way to reduce the side effects of cancer, resulting in part from physical inactivity and in part from the disease itself. Too much rest can lead to a decrease in aerobic fitness, strength, mobility and unwanted weight gain in the patient. In prostate cancer patients, hormonal treatment especially accelerates this process. In this paper we summarize the available evidence concerning the role of exercise in prostate cancer prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.",prostate cancer
"The importance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of various malignancies has been uncovered over the last few years. Their dysregulation often contributes to or is a result of tumour progression. In prostate cancer, the most common malignancy in men, lncRNAs can promote castration resistance, cell proliferation, invasion, and metastatic spread. Expression patterns of lncRNAs often change during tumour progression; their expression levels may constantly rise (e.g., HOX transcript antisense RNA, HOTAIR), or steadily decrease (e.g., downregulated RNA in cancer, DRAIC). In prostate cancer, lncRNAs likewise have diagnostic (e.g., prostate cancer antigen 3, PCA3), prognostic (e.g., second chromosome locus associated with prostate-1, SChLAP1), and predictive (e.g., metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript-1, MALAT-1) functions. Considering their dynamic role in prostate cancer, lncRNAs may also serve as therapeutic targets, helping to prevent development of castration resistance, maintain stable disease, and prohibit metastatic spread.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer was the first cancer in which immunotherapy vaccine was approved by FDA in 2010 named Sipuleucel-T. No new immunotherapies have been approved since, as phase 3 trials didn't show any improvement in overall survival (OS) especially with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Currently tremendous amount of research is going on, in studying microenvironment of prostate cancer, finding new targets and biomarkers, and trying different combination therapies. Some of the new targets explored are VISTA and PARP inhibitors. Combination therapies have shown promising results in early phase trials and likely in near future we will have an effective immunotherapy for advanced prostate cancer. In this article we will review the current data and future of immunotherapy in prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer units - hubs in the future care of men with prostate cancer Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in Sweden. The past decade has seen a tremendous development of new methods for diagnosing, staging, treating and rehabilitating men with suspicious or confirmed prostate cancer. This development necessitates a multidisciplinary and multiprofessional approach to the management of men with suspicious or confirmed prostate cancer. A recent survey showed that currently few Swedish men with prostate cancer receive the quality of care that is outlined in the national clinical guidelines. Specialised prostate cancer units are increasingly common in Europe, but as yet there are no such units in Sweden. We believe that the creation of prostate cancer units in Sweden would be an essential step forward, towards an improved future care of men with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Introduction: The 23rd Annual Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF) Scientific Retreat was convened October 27-29, 2016, in Carlsbad, CA. Methods: This event focuses on the latest advances in basic, translational, and clinical prostate cancer research with the greatest promise for advancing our understanding of prostate cancer biology and improving patient outcomes and quality of life. Results: Themes highlighted at this year's meeting included: i) targeting DNA repair deficiency in prostate cancer; ii) optimizing the use of Radium-223 and bone-targeting agents; iii) advances in cancer immunotherapeutic approaches; iv) targeting developmental pathways in prostate cancer; v) advances in circulating tumor DNA technology and applications; vi) precision survivorship; and vii) novel treatments and treatment strategies in prostate cancer.

"Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed on prostate adenocarcinomas, exhibits only limited expression in benign and extraprostatic tissues, and thus represents an ideal target for the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. Since its discovery over 30 y ago, significant effort has been made to develop clinical technology targeting PSMA. The last 5 y have seen an explosion of development of new agents targeting PSMA for diagnostic and therapeutic use. Imaging agents targeting PSMA have been developed for SPECT and PET platforms. PSMA PET imaging appears to outperform traditional imaging in the high-risk localized-disease state, in patients with biochemical recurrence after treatment, and in advanced disease. To date, most of the reported clinical studies of therapeutic agents have used PSMA-targeted radiometals to deliver β-radiation to metastatic disease sites, with 177Lu being the most widely investigated therapeutic radioisotope. Studies of both antibodies and small-molecule agents have been published and have demonstrated encouraging results. Safety appears generally limited to mild transient bone marrow toxicity and xerostomia because of uptake of the small-molecule agents in the salivary glands. Radiologic responses can be dramatic, and decreases in pain have been observed. The effect on overall survival, however, has yet to be demonstrated.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: Summarizes the rapid progress being made in treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Recent findings: Debate remains regarding the optimal sequencing of therapies in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer with attention focused on the use of abiraterone versus docetaxel. Randomized trials now show a potential advantage to next-generation antiandrogens in the setting of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Patient-specific genomic anomalies, in particular DNA repair defects, provide targets for therapy with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors alone and in combination with other interventions. Adjustments in the dose and administration schedule of the accompanying steroid may improve the efficacy of abiraterone. Novel radiopharmaceuticals and immunotherapies suggest progress is on the horizon for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Summary: In this review, we will highlight the avenues of research leading to optimization of therapies for men with advanced prostate cancer. Known therapeutics, such as docetaxel and abiraterone, are being used earlier in the disease course in the setting of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer, and next-generation antiandrogens in the setting of nonmetastatic castration-resistant disease. Existing interventions are being optimized, including a maneuver to salvage abiraterone response with steroid switch. Finally, individualized therapies directed at specific genomic aberrations, a radiopharmaceutical targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen, and immune therapy combinations are providing potentially additional treatment options for patients with refractory disease.",prostate cancer
"The first results of the UK ProtecT study have been published. A total of 1643 men with localised prostate cancer were randomised between active monitoring, radical prostatectomy, and external-beam radiotherapy. Comparisons between treatments showed no differences between surgery and radiotherapy in terms of cancer-specific survival and overall survival. Moreover, the patient-reported outcomes indicate that although the patterns of treatment-related side effects differ markedly according to the modality, neither surgery nor radiotherapy appears to be ""kinder"" overall. Conclusions from nonrandomised case series can be misleading, however carefully they are analysed, and this is particularly so for early prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Introduction: Newer approaches to the management of advanced prostate cancer have rapidly evolved. While basic androgen deprivation remains as the first line in newly diagnosed hormone naïve metastatic prostate cancer, the agents used and strategies followed have undergone significant changes. Numerous new agents such as sipuleucel-T, abiraterone, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel and radium 223 have all been approved since 2010 to treat metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). New imaging techniques to detect advanced disease such as F-18 PET, 11 C-choline PET and other modalities are becoming available. The concepts of ""bone health"" and the management of side effects related to androgen deprivation therapy are also gaining attention as men are being treated with longer courses of androgen deprivation. Understanding the theory behind these new agents and management approaches while focusing on the practical clinical considerations are essential to improve outcomes in advanced prostate cancer. Materials and methods: A review of the current state of the art in the management of advanced and castration resistant prostate cancer presented in this Canadian Journal of Urology International supplement was performed. Key findings are summarized and presented along with critical updates based on recent publications and meeting presentations. Results: Key concepts identified in the management of advanced prostate cancer included the new understanding of prostate cancer based on translational discoveries, applications of various hormonally based strategies in advanced disease including traditional and recently approved agents. The use of new imaging modalities to identify metastatic disease, immunotherapy approaches and discussions of sequencing and which new agents are likely to be available in the future in the management of CRPC were identified. Bone targeted strategies are also addressed in the setting of androgen deprivation and metastatic disease. Conclusions: The management of men with advanced prostate cancer has become more multidisciplinary as treatment options have expanded. As the use of these agents and new strategies expand, urologists, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists must all become familiar with this rapidly changing field in order to maximize the outcome of patients with advanced and castration resistant prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Essential facts Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and makes up 26 per cent of all male cancer diagnoses in the UK. According to the charity Prostate Cancer UK, more than 40,000 men are diagnosed with the disease every year. However, prostate cancer can be slow growing and many men have a cancer that will not cause them harm in their lifetime, says the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).",prostate cancer
"Within the Danish 'Diet, Cancer and Health' cohort, we aimed to investigate the association between prediagnostic fish intake (total, lean, fatty) and (a) incidence of total and high-grade prostate cancer and (b) the risk of all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality among men with prostate cancer. Among 27 178 men, 1690 prostate cancer cases were identified through 2012. Of these, 1042 had a Gleason score of 7 or above and 498 had a Gleason score of 8 or above at the time of diagnosis; 364 died (n=228 from prostate cancer) during follow-up through 2013. Cox proportional hazard models were used for the statistical analyses. No association between any type of fish intake and risk of total prostate cancer or high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score≥7 or ≥8) was found. For all-cause mortality, we found no association for any type of fish intake. For prostate cancer-specific mortality, only a higher intake of fatty fish was associated with a higher mortality [per daily 25 g increment in intake (mortality rate ratio=1.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.55; P=0.02)]. In conclusion, no strong association was found between fish consumption and the risk of or mortality from prostate cancer. Only a higher intake of fatty fish was associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a serious oncological disease in males. There has been a significant escalation in the incidence of this malignancy in the Czech Republic and in developed countries of Europe recently. Conversely, in countries with an altered health system, a minor increase in new cases of this disease is recorded. The causes of the high incidence of prostate cancer in developed countries appear to be the introduction of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test and prostate biopsy, an aging population, and the consequent increased risk of cancer. The possible contribution of physical and chemical carcinogens associated with environmental pollution and negative lifestyle changes should not be forgotten either. The mortality rate for prostate cancer remains stable, with a slight decline in recent years. The article provides an overview of trends in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer in the Czech Republic and Europe.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in the reproductive system of older males. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an important treatment for prostate cancer patients. However, almost all prostate cancer patients unavoidably progress to the castration-resistant stage after ADT treatment. Recent studies have shown that tumor-associated immune cells play major roles in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of prostate cancer. Various phenotypes of tumor-associated immune cells have tumor-promoting or antitumor functions mediated by interacting with tumor cells. Here, we review the current knowledge of tumor-associated immune cells in prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: In recent clinical trials, immunotherapeutic agents have demonstrated promising results for the treatment of prostate cancer. This review discusses emerging immunotherapies for prostate cancer and their evolving role in sequencing and combination therapy. Recent findings: Therapeutic vaccines including PROSTVAC and DCVAC/PCa have completed promising phase 2 trials for the treatment of prostate cancer and phase 3 trials are underway. Recent evidence supports a synergistic relationship between immunotherapy agents themselves, antiandrogens and with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Prostate cancer patients with good prognostic factors, such as minimal disease burden, appear to achieve the optimal benefit from immunotherapy. Summary: Therapeutic cancer vaccines and immunomodulating agents have demonstrated activity in the treatment of prostate cancer. Immunotherapies may alter the prostate tumor microenvironment and ongoing studies aim to provide guidance on effective sequencing and combination strategies.",prostate cancer
"Cancer stem cells have been defined as cells within a tumor that possesses the capacity to self-renew and to cause the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that comprise the tumor. Experimental evidence showed that these highly tumorigenic cells might be responsible for initiation and progression of cancer into invasive and metastatic disease. Eradicating prostate cancer stem cells, the root of the problem, has been considered as a promising target in prostate cancer treatment to improve the prognosis for patients with advanced stages of the disease.",prostate cancer
"Background: HDR afterloading brachytherapy (HDRBT) for prostate cancer is now established as an effective technique to achieve dose escalation in the radical treatment of localized prostate cancer. The previous guidelines published in 2005 from GEC ESTRO and EAU have been updated to reflect the current and emerging roles for HDRBT in prostate cancer. Patients and method: The indications for HDRBT in dose escalation schedules with external beam are wide ranging with all patients having localized disease eligible for this technique. Exclusion criteria are few encompassing patients medically unfit for the procedure and those with significant urinary outflow symptoms. Results: Recommendations for patient selection, treatment facility, implant technique, dose prescription and dosimetry reporting are given. Conclusions: HDRBT in prostate cancer can be practiced effectively and safely within the context of these guidelines with the main indication being for dose escalation with external beam. HDRBT used alone is currently under evaluation and its role in focal treatment and recurrence will be areas of future development.",prostate cancer

"In the United States of America male prostate cancer (PCa) is the most dominant malignancy and the second highest cause of cancer-related mortality risk compared to lung and colon cancers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenously expressed small, non-coding, single-stranded RNA which function as regulators of gene expression. They influence various physiological and pathophysiological processes. In this review, we focus on the regulation of miRNAs in prostate cancer and their mechanisms which contribute to prostate carcinogenesis. The relation of miRNAs with androgen signaling is highlighted and the prospects of miRNAs for clinical therapies are discussed.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer continues to be a significant public health issue worldwide, particularly in countries where men have life expectancies long enough to clinically manifest the disease. In many countries, it remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Although significant progress has been made over the past few decades, many elements regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with prostate cancer remain enigmatic. In this Prostate Cancer special issue, our expert authors present and examine clinically relevant topics and look ahead to future research.",prostate cancer
"This review summarizes current evidence of the etiology and diagnosis of prostate cancer. As before, a comprehensive urological examination remains the main method of diagnosing the disease. However, the invasive nature of the multicore prostate biopsy, its high cost and the need for specially trained personnel prompts to seek more state-of-the-art and non-invasive methods for diagnosing prostate cancer. The further research in this direction seems promising.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a unique and heterogeneous disease. Currently, a major unmet clinical need exists to develop biomarkers that enable indolent disease to be distinguished from aggressive disease. The prostate is an abundant secretor of glycoproteins of all types, and alterations in glycans are, therefore, attractive as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Despite progress over the past decade in profiling the genome and proteome, the prostate cancer glycoproteome remains relatively understudied. A wide range of alterations in the glycoproteins on prostate cancer cells can occur, including increased sialylation and fucosylation, increased O-β-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) conjugation, the emergence of cryptic and high-mannose N-glycans and alterations to proteoglycans. Glycosylation can alter protein function and has a key role in many important biological processes in cancer including cell adhesion, migration, interactions with the cell matrix, immune surveillance, cell signalling and cellular metabolism; altered glycosylation in prostate cancer might modify some, or all of these processes. In the past three years, powerful tools such as glycosylation-specific antibodies and glycosylation gene signatures have been developed, which enable detailed analyses of changes in glycosylation. Thus, emerging data on these often overlooked modifications have the potential to improve risk stratification and therapeutic strategies in patients with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Along with significant advances in prostate cancer biology research, we also observe the rapid development of modern diagnostic tests. New biomarkers are derived to detect disease while it is organ-confined to stratify the risk and to aid clinical decision-making. Majority of these tools have already been validated clinically, but only a few have received premarket clearance and administration approval. Superiority of novel tests is visible not only in improved detection accuracy but predominantly in the assessment of tumour aggressiveness and selection of patients eligible for conservative management. Two factors limiting the clinical implementation of validated biomarker candidates are costs and local availability. For these reasons, currently, their true clinical role starts after routine screening with prostate-specific antigen test. With this review of prostate cancer biomarkers, we attempted to draw general conclusions on clinical perspectives of these novel tools.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: Summarizes recent advances in the treatment of metastatic castration-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer. Recent findings: New randomized data suggest a survival advantage to early abiraterone in castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer. Prospective and retrospective studies are examining sequencing of existing cytotoxic and androgen-receptor-targeted therapies in both castration-sensitive and castration-resistant disease. Genomic analysis of both circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor nucleic acids is being examined as a potential method for selecting existing therapies and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Finally, immunotherapy combinations are being evaluated in the setting of advanced prostate cancer. Summary: In this review, we hope to summarize the recent data supporting the use of early abiraterone in castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer and discuss how this data might be incorporated with previous trials showing a survival advantage to early docetaxel. We present recent series examining sequencing of approved therapies as well as trials evaluating novel biomarkers and genomic analyses designed to help choose from among approved therapies or evaluate drugs in development. Lastly, we review ongoing trials examining novel immunotherapy combinations in advanced prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"With the aging of the population, changes in diet and medical examination popular, the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer in China are increasing year by year. Over the past year, a large number of clinical and basic researchers focus on various perspectives of prostate cancer, which may provide new direction for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. In this paper, the near year important progress in the forefront of prostate cancer has been reviewed and summed up in two major aspects: diagnosis and treatment.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: Summarize recent advances in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Recent findings: Recent randomized data suggest a survival advantage to early use of novel androgen receptor inhibitors in combination with androgen deprivation therapy both in the setting of hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer and nonmetastatic castration-resistant disease. While ongoing analyses examine optimal sequencing of existing agents for treatment of advanced prostate cancer, additional research focuses on expanding treatment options through development of novel genomically targeted therapies, antibody-drug conjugates, and immune therapy combinations. Summary: In this review, we summarize the recent data supporting the early use of novel androgen receptor inhibitors in advanced prostate cancer and aim to also frame how these drugs may fit within the existing context of docetaxel and abiraterone. We present recent series examining sequencing of approved therapies while searching for predictive biomarkers. Finally, we examine trials evaluating novel agents that target certain biological pathways to highlight the likely future directions for progress in the clinical management of advanced prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Objectives: Though the external beam radiation therapy is a standard treatment option for both organ-confined and regionally advanced prostate cancer, unluckily, despite more and more effective advances in radiation delivery procedures, the prostate cancer radioresistance still occurs in a significant amount of patients undergone radiotherapy. This review aims to highlight the molecular aberrations of prostate cancer cell growth- and apoptosis signaling pathways that might induce, together with both prostate cancer cell/cancer stem cells gene- and surrounding microenvironment crucial implications, the tumor radioresistance. Methods: An up-dated review of several thorough studies on such matter. Results: The plenty of intriguing knowledge acquisitions about the prostate cancer radioresistance depending on cancer cell growth/ apoptosis signaling pathway-related molecular aberrations together with prostate cancer cell/cancer stem cell abnormal gene profile, may be the premise leading--on the basis of preclinical research in animal models--to clinically overcome the tumor radioresistance. Conclusions: Current developments of radiosensitizer agents focusly targeting prostate cancer cell radioresistance-associated specific molecular/gene aberrations are directed to improve, by implementing customized tumor radiosensitization modalities, the radiation therapy outcomes.",prostate cancer
"Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy to treat localized prostate cancer has increased in popularity, although other options exist, including radiotherapy and active surveillance. The decision about choosing the right treatment has become pertinent for many patients. This literature review aimed to assess the current state-of-the-art regarding decisional aids and the associated decisional outcomes for the purpose of designing a method for both patients and doctors to use to make the best treatment decision for the patient. A literature search was conducted via MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases using the keywords ""prostate"" and ""cancer"" and ""impact"" and ""decisio*"" and ""treatment."" Articles were included that focused on treatment outcomes, decision-making processes, and the use of decisional aids for localized prostate cancer. Articles that investigated prostate cancer in general or prostate cancer screening were excluded, as were articles that were not written in English. Altogether, 13 articles were finally critically reviewed for this study. Results were conflicting regarding the relations between patient factors, use of decisional aids, and decisional outcomes. There was a large gap in the literature regarding the optimal decision-making process for men with localized prostate cancer. The role of currently available decisional aids is limited to helping patients make the right decisions. There is a need to develop a novel decisional aid in which patient-physician discussion-involving evaluation of a spectrum of patient-, doctor-, and treatment-related factors-is included.",prostate cancer
"Genetic instability is one part of the oncogenic process. Gene mutations involved in DNA repair mechanisms can promote this genetic instability and participate in oncogenesis and metastatic progression. In prostate cancer, DNA repair abnormalities mainly correspond to somatic or constitutional mutations of the BRCA2 and ATM genes. Therapeutic management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is currently based on new hormonal therapies (abiraterone, enzalutamide) and taxane-type chemotherapy (docetaxel or cabazitaxel). Preliminary data tend to indicate a specific activity of agents causing DNA breaks (platinum salts) and PARP inhibitors in patients with these DNA repair abnormalities. The frequency of DNA repair gene mutations in patients with prostate cancer (around 20%) and the antitumor response of PARP inhibitors make it a possible short-term therapeutic strategy with several registering clinical trials ongoing.",prostate cancer
"Aim: To review the current landscape of outlier genes in the field of prostate cancer. Methods: A comprehensive review was performed. Results: Prostate cancer continues to be a significant worldwide health issue. In the era of personalized medicine, more emphasis is being placed on the ability to determine the timing, intensity and type of treatment, according to each patient's unique disease. Several commercial tests are available to determine the risk of aggressive prostate cancer based on genomic biomarkers and gene expression. Outlier genes represent a form of cancer classification that focuses on bimodal expression of a gene in a specific subset of patients. Outlier genes identified in prostate cancer include TMPRSS2-ERG, SPINK1, ScHLAP1, NVL, SMC4 and SQLE. Conclusion: Classifying patient prostate cancers by outlier genes may allow for individualized cancer therapies and improved cancer therapy outcomes.",prostate cancer

"Purpose: The impact of family history on the diagnosis of the prostate cancer among Asian population remains controversial. We evaluated whether a positive family history of the prostate cancer in Korean men is associated with the diagnosis and aggressiveness of the prostate cancer. Materials and methods: Patients who underwent a transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy from March 2015 to September 2017 were evaluated. Information on family history was obtained via a self-administered questionnaire. The presence of prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥7) was evaluated according to the presence of a family history. Results: Of 602 patients (median age, 68.3 years; median prostate-specific antigen level, 6.28 ng/mL), 41 (6.8%) patients had a family history of prostate cancer. Family history was a significant factor for detecting prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR], 2.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.330-6.704; p=0.008). In multivariate analysis for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer, family history was a significant predictor (OR, 6.32; 95% CI; 2.790-14.298; p<0.001). Conclusions: A family history of prostate cancer in Korean men was a significant factor for predicting prostate cancer. Moreover, significant differences in the aggressive features of the disease were identified between patients with and without a family history.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer among men in most western populations, and it is the second leading cause of cancer death among U.S. men. Despite its high morbidity, the etiology of prostate cancer remains largely unknown. Advancing age, race, and a family history of prostate cancer are the only established risk factors. Many putative risk factors, including androgens, diet, physical activity, sexual factors, inflammation, and obesity, have been implicated, but their roles in prostate cancer etiology remain unclear. It is estimated that as much as 42% of the risk of prostate cancer may be accounted for by genetic influences, including individual and combined effects of rare, highly penetrant genes, more common weakly penetrant genes, and genes acting in concert with each other. Numerous genetic variants in the androgen biosynthesis/metabolism, carcinogen metabolism, DNA repair, and chronic inflammation pathways, have been explored, but the results are largely inconclusive. The pathogenesis of prostate cancer likely involves interplay between environmental and genetic factors. To unravel these complex relationships, large well-designed interdisciplinary epidemiologic studies are needed. With newly available molecular tools, a new generation of large-scale multidisciplinary population-based studies is beginning to investigate gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Results of these studies may lead to better detection, treatment, and, ultimately, prevention of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Malignant prostate tumors rank with its incidence among the most frequent tumors in man in Czech Republic. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate due to its unusual behavior occupy especial position among solid tumors. Large group of these tumors are at least initially sensitive to hormonal therapy. After the introduction of PSA in the diagnostic methods we can gradually see shift of the new cases of prostate cancer to the localised stage. Those are relatively curable. Movement to less localized stage diminishes the chance of recovery, but even the metastatic adenocarcinoma can be stabilised at least for some time. The aim of therapy of hormonal refractory cancer is to maintain good quality of life and in some prolongation of survival.",prostate cancer
"A 71-year-old man was admitted to the department of general surgery at our hospital due to constipation. A large bowel endoscopic examination revealed a stenosis of the rectum near the anus. The pathological diagnosis of the biopsy was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. After a computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging examination, rectal cancer infiltrating the prostate was the diagnosis. External beam radiation therapy and chemotherapy were performed. After those neoadjuvant therapies, an abdominoperineal resection of the rectum (Miles) and a retropubic radical prostatectomy were performed. The final pathological diagnosis was prostate cancer infiltrating the rectum. Prostate cancer infiltrating the rectum is rare because of the Denonvillier's fascia barrier. However, it is difficult to distinguish prostate cancer infiltrating the rectum from rectal cancer infiltrating the prostate. Thus, when we see rectal cancer infiltrating the prostate, prostate cancer infiltrating the rectum should be suspected, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level should be determined, and PSA immunostaining should be performed.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer incurs a substantial incidence and mortality burden, similarly to breast cancer, and it ranks among the top ten specific causes of death in the United States. It is inherent as we maximize the detection of early prostate cancer that we increase the detection of both nonaggressive (slow growing) and aggressive (faster growing) prostate cancers. The evidence clearly supports the use of PSA screening in conjunction with DRE as a means of early detection of prostate cancer. Widespread implementation of prostate cancer screening in the United States has led to the phenomenon of stage migration with more cancers being detected at a lower stage. Such a trend has decreased the incidence of metastatic disease at diagnosis and paralleled the decrease of the mortality rate from prostate cancer. Our understanding of the natural history of prostate cancer is progressing over time, but the question of its length is unanswerable. The relatively long doubling time (on average) of early prostate cancer of 3 to 4 years or more indicates a relatively good prognosis for many men with this disease, even without early detection and treatment. Unfortunately, the poor specificity of the PSA test in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) leads to high rates of prostate biopsy and attendant illnesses and costs. Early detection is more apt to detect a slow-growing prostate cancer than a faster growing cancer that is associated with a more rapid course of progression to metastatic disease. Hence, the launching of mass screening programs for the early detection of prostate cancer is premature. However, in the absence of solid evidence of benefit, one reasonable approach to screening at the individual level is to involve the patient in decisions about whether or not to perform a PSA test. Thus, ""offering"" PSA testing must be accompanied by informed discussion within the context of an ongoing patient-physician relationship. This is to be distinguished from the use of PSA testing for the purpose of ""mass screening."" Concepts that must be explored with the patient include: 1. The long-term ramifications of screening 2. The relatively high probability of further evaluation and biopsy with positive results 3. Potentially difficult decisions that may arise about using treatments that are associated with considerable morbidity and uncertain benefits (at the time) if cancer is discovered We should identify a future path that is evidence-based, focused on the issues that make a difference to patients, and results in better and longer lives of those with the disease and those who are at risk of getting it. If that path leads to treating fewer patients in the future, even if sometimes more aggressively, we should pursue it definitely and consequently.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer remains the only solid tumor diagnosed using transrectal ultrasound-guided sampling of the gland, and not an image-based, lesion-directed approach. This technique has limitations in that it underdiagnoses clinically significant disease and overdiagnoses indolent tumors resulting in overtreatment of patients. Technical advances in MRI in the last decade have made this method the preferred imaging modality for prostate anatomy and for risk assessment of prostate cancer. As of 2018, the indications for MRI in the diagnosis and risk assessment of prostate cancer have expanded from preoperative evaluation to the pre-biopsy setting, as well as for surveillance protocols. This article summarizes the current role of multiparametric MRI in the diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging for the localization of prostate cancer is increasingly available in Germany. The advances and limitations in different disease stages are reviewed. As the clinical relevance of oligometastatic disease in primary cancer detected by PSMA PET-CT imaging is not yet completely understood, it should only be used in clinical trials. In recurrent prostate cancer after therapy with curative intent, PSMA PET-CT shows encouraging potential for the planning of salvage therapy. In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer evidence for its use is not available.",prostate cancer
"Glucocorticoids have been used in the treatment of prostate cancer to slow disease progression, improve pain control and offset side effects of chemo- and hormonal therapy. However, they may also have the potential to drive prostate cancer growth via mutated androgen receptors or glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). In this review we examine historical and contemporary use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of prostate cancer, review potential mechanisms by which they may inhibit or drive prostate cancer growth, and describe potential means of defining their contribution to the biology of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Major advances through tumor profiling technologies, that include next-generation sequencing, epigenetic, proteomic and transcriptomic methods, have been made in primary prostate cancer, providing novel biomarkers that may guide precision medicine in the near future. Areas covered: The authors provided an overview of novel molecular biomarkers in tissue, blood and urine that may be used as clinical tools to assess prognosis, improve selection criteria for active surveillance programs, and detect disease relapse early in localized prostate cancer. Expert commentary: Active surveillance (AS) in localized prostate cancer is an accepted strategy in patients with very low-risk prostate cancer. Many more patients may benefit from watchful waiting, and include patients of higher clinical stage and grade, however selection criteria have to be optimized and early recognition of transformation from localized to lethal disease has to be improved by addition of molecular biomarkers. The role of non-invasive biomarkers is challenging the need for repeat biopsies, commonly performed at 1 and 4 years in men under AS programs.",prostate cancer
"Radical treatments such as prostatectomy and radiotherapy have demonstrated success in terms of biochemical and disease-specific survival for localised prostate cancer. However, whilst the end goal of any cancer treatment is to control or cure disease it must also do so by minimising any side effects that may be experienced by the patient. Focal therapy as a concept aims to redress this established therapeutic ratio by treating areas of the prostate affected by significant disease as opposed to treating the entire gland. However, there are a number of common criticisms of focal therapy - we deem the seven sins - that require further interrogation.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer screening is an absolutely controversial topic and under debate. The points of view from which the problem is analyzed also influence this issue; patient, physician and Health Care authorities have different interests that most of the times are not comprehensively analyzed. Currently, no clinical guideline supports the performance of a population screening with active recruitment, but they do support the credible information to the man who desires its performance of potential benefits and risks (opportunistic screening), as well as its performance in certain risk groups. Nevertheless, what is inherent to any screening program is the overdiagnosis of clinically irrelevant disease, which in prostate cancer has been calculated around 50%, and that, from our point of view, gives cause to the correct implementation of active surveillance programs to tamponade the potential deleterious effects of active therapies of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The combination of radiation treatment and long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been shown in multiple clinical trials to prolong overall survival in men with high-risk prostate cancer compared with either treatment alone. New radiation technologies enable the safe delivery of high radiation doses that improve cancer control compared with lower radiation doses. Based on the results of multiple randomized trials, clinical practice guidelines for high-risk prostate cancer recommend total radiation doses of at least 75.6 Gy, with long-term (2-3 years) ADT. Ongoing research into hypofractionated radiation treatment, whole-pelvic radiation, and combinations of radiation with novel hormonal agents could further improve cancer control and survival outcomes for patients with high-risk prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies threatening men's health, and the mechanisms underlying its initiation and progression are poorly understood. Last decade has witnessed encouraging progress in the studies of prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs), which are considered to play important roles in tumor initiation, recurrence and metastasis, castration resistance, and drug resistance. Therefore, a deeper insight into PCSCs is of great significance for the successful management of prostate cancer. This article presents an overview on the location, origin, and markers of PCSCs as well as their potential correlation with tumor metastasis and castration resistance.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: The successful development of effective cancer immunotherapy, in particular immune checkpoint inhibitors, has changed the treatment paradigm of many tumor types. In light of the limited efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors demonstrated in recent clinical trials in refractory prostate cancer, this review highlights important recent and ongoing studies that are shaping the pursuit of effective immunotherapy for prostate cancer. Recent findings: We review two overarching themes with respect to recent studies of prostate cancer immunotherapy: evolving therapeutic strategies and novel biological findings, including the landscape of predictive biomarkers of immunotherapy response. Summary: Novel and combinatorial immunotherapy strategies are being implemented across the clinical spectrum of prostate cancer. Greater understanding of complex tumor-immune interactions and the determinants of therapy response in prostate cancer is an area of intense investigation, and will inform both translational and clinical immuno-oncology research in the field.",prostate cancer
"The lack of reliable imaging tools in detecting prostate cancer makes a random biopsy still the standard of care to detect prostate cancer. To reduce the number of cores during a biopsy and therefore the risk of biopsy-related complications, an imaging tool which provides reliable guided biopsies is required. Transrectal real-time elastography has shown to have the ability to visualize prostate cancer foci to some extent. In addition to the conventional B-mode image of transrectal ultrasound, it adds information about the stiffness of the prostate tissue. This review highlights the most important studies on elastography to follow the improvements in techniques and to outline the ability to detect prostate cancer and guide biopsies.",prostate cancer
"In many studies, it has been demonstrated that (1)H MRSI of the human prostate has great potential to aid prostate cancer management, e.g. in the detection and localisation of cancer foci in the prostate or in the assessment of its aggressiveness. It is particularly powerful in combination with T2 -weighted MRI. Nevertheless, the technique is currently mainly used in a research setting. This review provides an overview of the state-of-the-art of three-dimensional MRSI, including the specific hardware required, dedicated data acquisition sequences and information on the spectral content with background on the MR-visible metabolites. In clinical practice, it is important that relevant MRSI results become available rapidly, reliably and in an easy digestible way. However, this functionality is currently not fully available for prostate MRSI, which is a major obstacle for routine use by inexperienced clinicians. Routine use requires more automation in the processing of raw data than is currently available. Therefore, we pay specific attention in this review on the status and prospects of the automated handling of prostate MRSI data, including quality control. The clinical potential of three-dimensional MRSI of the prostate is illustrated with literature examples on prostate cancer detection, its localisation in the prostate, its role in the assessment of cancer aggressiveness and in the selection and monitoring of therapy.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer and chronic prostatitis are prevalent disorders in men. The cause of prostate cancer and chronic prostatitis is multifocal and diverse. Both disorders exhibit characteristic elevation of serum prostate-specific antigen, currently the primary screening test for prostate cancer. Prostate inflammation, regardless of cause, is the histopathologic hallmark of chronic prostatitis. In general, inflammation is associated with multiple cancers, and prostate inflammation, in particular, is a suggested factor in the development and progression of prostate cancer. This review addresses the link between chronic prostatitis and prostate cancer, especially as it relates to clinical practice.",prostate cancer
"Despite radical treatment, many men with prostate cancer will develop recurrence of their disease. In an exciting era of new therapies for prostate cancer in general, we focus on how these will specifically benefit those men with recurrent disease. We consider salvage treatments aimed at those with local recurrence confined to the prostate gland, therapies for those presenting with metastatic recurrence and the approach to men presenting with a rising prostate-specific antigen but no demonstrable disease (M0). In general, men with recurrent disease are often under-represented in randomized clinical trials. Consequently, evidence to guide treatment for these men is often lacking and this needs to be addressed in order to improve and better define our approach to this problem in the future.",prostate cancer
"Objectives: To examine the relationship between the recently defined Gleason grade groups and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Methods: If the probability of prostate cancer-specific death is symbolized as P(PSD), the probability of biochemical failure is symbolized as P(BF), and the probability of prostate cancer-specific death after biochemical failure is symbolized as P(PSD | BF), then the rules of probability provide a way to estimate P(PSD) as P(PSD) = P(PSD | BF) * P(BF) Using this model and data from the literature for P(PSD | BF) and P(BF), I estimate here values of P(PSD) for the five newly described Gleason grade groups. Results: The expected probability of prostate cancer- specific death is closely related to the new Gleason grade groups and ranges from a low of 0.014 for grade group 1 to a high of 0.15 for grade group 5. Conclusions: Although using the original study patient population may require years of additional follow-up to examine prostate cancer-specific mortality, the evidence available now indicates that these new Gleason grade groups relate to prostate cancer-specific mortality.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer incidences in most Asian populations have rapidly increased, and prostate cancer ranks as the highest incidence of male cancer in Japan since 2015. Androgen depriva- tion therapy (ADT) remains the main first-line treatment for patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa). However, treatment benefits last for 3-5 years when disease transforms into metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Currently, management paradigms for mPCa are dramatically changing. Two multicenter, randomized trials have redefined first-line treatment, with the demonstration of improved overall survival with the addition of docetaxel chemotherapy to ADT. Several data have re- ported the impact on survival of radiotherapy of the prostate even in patients diagnosed with mPCa. The objective of this review is to summarize an overview of current multidisciplinary approaches for mPCa and mCRPC.",prostate cancer
"With the significant increase of the average lifespan in the industrial world, the number of elderly people, as a proportion of the total population, has risen dramatically. It has been estimated that this trend will accelerate and that, by the year 2020, the number of people aged >80 years will soar by 135%. With age being the greatest risk factor for prostate cancer, this disease has understandably become one of the greatest public health concerns. Recently, considerable attention has been focused on prostate cancer management in the elderly, with specific emphasis on the question of whether, or not, it should differ from that of younger patients. We thoroughly reviewed the existing evidence on screening, diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer in the elderly and concluded that age alone should not constitute an obstruction for optimal treatment administration. Physicians treating aged prostate cancer patients should be trained in an individualized approach, based on clinical performance status and comorbitities.",prostate cancer
"The canine prostate gland shares many morphological and functional similarities with the human prostate and dogs are the only other large mammals that commonly develop spontaneous prostate cancer. However, the incidence of prostate cancer is much lower in dogs and the precise cell of origin is not known. Dogs with prostate cancer usually present with advanced disease that does not respond to androgen deprivation therapy. Similar to humans, affected dogs often develop osteoblastic bone metastases in the pelvis and/or lumbar spine with associated pain and neurological deficits. Other clinical signs include weight loss, lethargy, and abnormal urination and/or defecation. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation have been used to treat dogs with prostate cancer, but success has been limited by the location and aggressive nature of the disease. It is evident that better methods of early detection and more effective therapies are needed for prostate cancer in dogs and advanced prostate carcinoma in men. Dogs with naturally-occurring prostate cancer are relevant models for the disease in humans and pre-clinical studies of new diagnostics and therapies in dogs may benefit both humans and dogs with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Surgery remains a mainstay in the management of localized prostate cancer. This article addresses surgical aspects germane to the management of men with prostate cancer, including patient selection for surgery, nerve-sparing approaches, minimization of positive surgical margins, and indications for pelvic lymph node dissection. Outcomes for men with high-risk prostate cancer following surgery are reviewed, and the present role of neoadjuvant therapy before radical prostatectomy is discussed. In addition, there is a review of the published literature on surgical ablative therapies for prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"There is a great need to identify new and better prognostic and predictive biomarkers to stratify prostate cancer patients for optimal treatment. The aims of this study were to characterize the expression profile of pre-B cell leukemia homeobox (PBX) transcription factors in prostate cancer with an emphasis on investigating whether PBX3 harbours any prognostic value. The expression profile of PBX3 and PBX1 in prostate tissue was determined by immunohistochemical and immunoblot analysis. Furthermore, the expression of PBX3 transcript variants was analyzed by RT-PCR, NanoString Technologies®, and by analyzing RNA sequence data. The potential of PBX3 to predict prognosis, either at mRNA or protein level, was studied in four independent cohorts. PBX3 was mainly expressed in the nucleus of normal prostate basal cells, while it showed cytosolic expression in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer cells. We detected four PBX3 transcript variants in prostate tissue. Competing risk regression analysis revealed that high PBX3 expression was associated with slower progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (sub-hazard ratio (SHR) 0.18, 95% CI: 0.081-0.42, p values < 0.001). PBX3 expression had a high predictive accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.82) when combined with Gleason score and age. Patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, with high levels of PBX3 mRNA, had improved prostate cancer specific survival compared to patients expressing low levels (SHR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.46-0.93, p values < 0.001, and AUC = 0.75). Our findings strongly indicate that PBX3 has potential as a biomarker, both as part of a larger gene panel and as an immunohistochemical marker, for aggressive prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Introduction: Androgen deprivation therapy is the mainstay treatment for patients with prostate cancer who are not candidates for definitive treatment, are diagnosed with advanced disease on initial presentation or progress after primary treatment. Patients who stop responding to androgen deprivation therapy develop castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Emerging drugs undergoing clinical evaluation and drugs that have recently received FDA approval for the treatment of CRPC are reviewed. Areas covered: As the natural history and signaling pathways of prostate cancer are better understood, new treatments and targeted therapies will be developed. The FDA recently approved 5 medications that increase survival in patients with CRPC. Additional medications and drug classes are being explored that may eventually lead to new treatment options. Articles were identified using a PubMed database search. Expert opinion: Recent FDA medication approvals and the development of emerging treatments are promising for the future of patients with prostate cancer. The addition of new medications challenges physicians to identify the optimal sequence and/or combination in which newer and older medications should be administered. Physicians treating patients with prostate cancer have a growing responsibility to keep pace with these new medications so that they may counsel and treat patients appropriately.",prostate cancer
"The standard approach for the detection of prostate cancer--prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening followed by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsy--has low sensitivity and provides limited information about the true extent and aggressiveness of the cancer. Improved methods are needed to assess the extent and aggressiveness of the cancer and to identify patients who will benefit from therapy. In recent years, there has been tremendous development of acquisition and processing tools for physiological and metabolic MRI techniques which play a potential role in the detection, localization and characterization of prostate cancer, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and/or proton MR spectroscopic imaging ((1)H MRSI). The standard protocol for prostate MRI without the use of a contrast agent involves multi-planar T1 -weighted MRI, T2 -weighted MRI and DW-MRI. This review discusses the potential role of MRI in the detection of prostate cancer, specifically describing the status of MRI as a tool for guiding targeted prostate biopsies and for detecting cancer in the untreated and treated gland. In addition, future areas of MRI research are briefly discussed. Groups conducting clinical trials should consider the recommendations put forward by the European Consensus Meeting, which state that the minimum requirements for prostate MRI are T1 -weighted MRI, T2 -weighted MRI, DCE-MRI (which involves the use of a contrast agent) and DW-MRI with a pelvic phased-array coil and propose the use of transperineal template mapping biopsies as the optimal reference standard.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is common among men in the United States. Factors of possible importance in the etiology of prostate cancer include diet, primarily implicated by ecologic studies of national, regional, and ethnic variation in rates; endocrine function, implicated by the importance of endocrine function in normal prostatic growth and in the treatment of prostate cancer; genetic susceptibility, supported by familial aggregation; some aspect of sexual behavior, suggested by case-control differences in sexual behavior; and occupational exposure, particularly cadmium exposure. Despite the public health importance of prostate cancer, it has received only moderate epidemiologic study; thus the etiologic importance of these and other possible determinants of prostate cancer risk is uncertain [55].",prostate cancer

"Purpose: We analyzed the pathological and oncologic characteristics of anteriorly located prostate cancer and assessed the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging to detect anterior prostate cancer. Materials and methods: We analyzed the records of 728 consecutive patients treated with radical prostatectomy. Patients were categorized with anterior or prostate cancer or tumors involving the anterior and posterior prostate according to the dominant tumor location on whole mount section. Results: The anterior and posterior prostate cancer groups and the group with cancer at both locations represented 31.0%, 46.7% and 22.3% of the total number of patients, respectively. Anterior prostate cancer was less commonly palpable (p <0.001) and needed more frequent repeat biopsy (p = 0.012) than posterior prostate cancer. Moreover, the anterior group had fewer positive cores than the posterior group (p <0.001) despite comparable tumor volumes. Gleason score upgrading was more frequently observed in anterior than in posterior prostate cancer (p = 0.003). However, final pathological features did not significantly differ. Only the seminal vesicle involvement rate was lower in anterior than in posterior prostate cancer (p <0.001). Estimated 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival in patients with anterior prostate cancer was 87.5%, significantly higher than in patients with posterior prostate cancer (77.4%, p = 0.001) and patients with anterior plus posterior involvement (74.4%, p <0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that anterior location was an independent prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence (HR 0.403) along with other well-known prognostic factors. To detect anterior prostate tumors the sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging were 78.1% and 58.2%, respectively. Conclusions: Anterior prostate cancer had pathological features and favorable oncologic outcomes comparable to those of posterior prostate cancer but also more frequent Gleason score upgrading. Magnetic resonance imaging had moderate diagnostic performance for detecting lesions in the anterior prostate.",prostate cancer
"This article reviews the definition, incidence, pathological characteristics and natural history of low risk localised prostate cancer. Low risk disease is typically defined as clinical stage T1/T2a, biopsy Gleason score </=6, PSA < 10. This risk classification has provided a useful system for reporting of outcomes and for the production of clinical guidelines. However, the low-risk disease is a broad category with a range of pathological characteristics and clinical behaviour. Many, but not all, low-risk prostate cancers are clinically insignificant, destined never to cause any harm. The challenge of managing low risk localized prostate cancer is to distinguish patients with clinically relevant cancers, who may benefit from radical treatment, from the remainder who do not need any intervention. The natural history of untreated low-risk localised prostate cancer has not been well studied, partly because it is a relatively recent entity, and partly because it has been standard practice for men with low risk disease to receive treatment. Data from watchful waiting in the pre-PSA era, modelling studies to take account of the lead time and overdiagnosis associated with PSA testing, and the early results of active surveillance can all provide insights into the likely natural history of low risk disease. There remains a major unmet need for markers of individual prostate cancer behaviour within the low-risk category. Such markers could be used to distinguish those men with truly indolent disease, suitable for observation, from those with significant prostate cancer that stand to benefit from treatment.",prostate cancer
"Objective: To discuss the novel biomarkers of microRNAs in prostate cancer. Data sources: The literatures about microRNAs and prostate cancer cited in this review were obtained mainly from Pubmed published in English from 2004 to 2012. Study selection: Original articles regarding the novel role of microRNAs in prostate cancer were selected. Results: MicroRNAs play an important role in prostate cancer such as cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion. Especially microRNAs correlate with prostate cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer stem cells (CSCs), drug sensitivity, cancer microenvironment, energy metabolism, androgen independence transformation, and diagnosis prediction. Conclusions: MicroRNAs are involved in various aspects of prostate cancer biology. The role of microRNA in the initiation and development of prostate cancer deserves further study.",prostate cancer
"Recent research makes it probable that there is a hereditary form of prostate cancer. By identifying prostate cancer cases in the Swedish twin registry it was possible to show a pronounced difference in proband concordance rates and correlation of liability between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, which indicates strongly that genetic factors are important for prostate cancer. In a nation-wide register cohort study it was found that the risk for prostate cancer was approximately two times higher among sons to prostate cancer patients when compared to Swedish men in general. By linkage analyses at least two loci for putative prostate cancer genes have been identified, one on chromosome 1 (1q24-25) and one on the X-chromosome (Xq27-28). Before genetic testing becomes available it was suggested that men with the familiar aggregation of prostate cancer should be evaluated with a PSA test on a regular basis.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common, non-dermatologic cancer in men. Since prostate cancer is highly associated with increased age, the incidence of this disease is expected to increase as the population ages. In its initial stages prostate cancer depends upon the actions of androgen, and androgen deprivation therapy induces tumor regression. Currently, androgen deprivation is achieved by either surgical or chemical androgen blockade. Unfortunately, nearly all prostate cancer patients develop tumors that grow despite androgen blockade and ultimately relapse. Many alterations in prostate cancer cells contribute to this state. Although chemotherapy induces short remissions in some patients, there are no curative therapies for metastatic disease. This review summarizes our current understanding in androgen signaling and the mechanisms that allow tumor cells to bypass androgen manipulation therapy. The identification of novel survival pathways and effector molecules that drive androgen independent growth is necessary to develop effective therapies for advanced prostate cancers.",prostate cancer
"Recently, many therapeutic agents for prostate cancer have been approved that target the androgen receptor and/or the prostate tumor microenvironment. Each of these therapies has modestly increased patient survival. A better understanding of when in the course of prostate cancer progression specific therapies should be applied, and of what biomarkers would indicate when resistance arises, would almost certainly improve survival due to these therapies. Thus, applying the armamentarium of therapeutic agents in the right sequences in the right combination at the right time is a major goal in prostate cancer treatment. For this to occur, an understanding of prostate cancer evolution during progression is required. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of prostate cancer progression, but challenge the prevailing view by proposing a new model of prostate cancer progression, with the goal of improving biologic classification and treatment strategies. We use this model to discuss how integrating clinical and basic understanding of prostate cancer will lead to better implementation of molecularly targeted therapeutics and improve patient survival.",prostate cancer
"The staging, screening and diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer are discussed. Prostate cancer kills about 40,000 men in the United States each year. Signs and symptoms range from dysuria to features of advanced metastatic disease. The American Urological System of staging prostate cancer designates four stages, A through D. The tumor is graded histologically with the Gleason scale. Methods used in the screening and diagnosis of prostate cancer include digital rectal examination, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay, biopsy, transrectal ultrasonography, and determination of PSA density, velocity, and age specificity. The value of screening and treatment remains controversial because tumors are generally slow-growing and conclusive data showing an effect on survival time are lacking. Treatment methods consist of prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and hormonal drug therapy or bilateral orchiectomy. The choice is influenced primarily by the stage of the disease but also by the patient's age, physical condition, and response to prior therapy. Patients with stage A or B disease are considered for prostatectomy or radiation therapy. The primary treatment for stage C disease is radiation therapy. For stage D, the main approaches are watchful waiting and bilateral orchiectomy or hormonal drug therapy to reduce androgenic stimulation of prostate tissue. Long-term survival rates are high for stages A and B and considerably lower for stages C and D. Prostate cancer responds to estrogens, but adverse effects are frequent and potentially severe. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (leuprolide and goserelin) are as effective as estrogens but have less toxicity; a disadvantage of these agents is an initial flaring of the disease. Other hormonal agents used include antiandrogens-progestins, flutamide, and bicalutamide. Secondary hormonal treatments (aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole) are less effective than initial hormonal therapy. Antineoplastic agents have little or no effectiveness in prostate cancer. Although the value of screening for and treating prostate cancer continues to be debated, many experts recommend annual screening for all men over 50. Research to identify more effective drugs for treating advanced disease continues.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common malignant neoplasm in men and the second most frequent cause of cancer death for males in the United States. Recently, emerging evidence suggests that prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs) may play a critical role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Therefore, targeting prostate CSCs for the prevention of tumor progression and treatment of prostate cancer could become a novel strategy for better treatment of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. In this review article, we will summarize the most recent advances in the prostate CSCs field, with particular emphasis on targeting prostate CSCs to treat prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The 21st Annual Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF) Scientific Retreat was held from October 23-25, 2014, in Carlsbad, CA. This event is the world's foremost scientific meeting focusing on prostate cancer and brings together leading basic, translational and clinical researchers in prostate cancer and other diverse disciplines to discuss the newest findings most likely to advance the understanding of prostate cancer and the clinical care of prostate cancer patients. This year's meeting highlighted themes including: (i) research integrity and standards for scientific reproducibility; (ii) prostate cancer disparities; (iii) mechanisms and models of prostate cancer progression and dormancy; (iv) mechanisms of therapeutic resistance; and (v) advancements in precision medicine treatments, treatment models, and predictive and prognostic biomarkers.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the fourth leading cause of mortality in Australian men. The prevalence and incidence is increasing in both developed and developing nations, thus there is a need for better screening and management of this disorder. While there is no direct known cause of prostate cancer, management is largely focused on early detection and treatment strategies. Of particular concern is advanced prostate cancer which can manifest as castrate resistant prostate cancer characterized by therapy resistance. This short review outlines the global epidemiology of prostate cancer, clinical manifestations, risk factors, current screening strategies including first line clinical screening as well as the use of circulating biomarkers, and treatment of prostate cancer through mainstream therapeutics as well as the cutting edge peptide and nano-technology based therapeutics that are being implemented or in the process of development to overcome therapeutic obstacles in the treatment of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"For decades, androgen deprivation was the standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer. Chemotherapy, then novel anti-androgen therapies, changed the treatment paradigm. Large phase III randomized clinical trials were conducted over the course of the last decade, first among patients with castration resistant prostate cancer, then among those with hormone-sensitive disease. Today, androgen deprivation therapy alone is no longer the gold standard and should be associated either with chemotherapy in high-volume disease, or novel anti-androgen therapy. As such, each case should be discussed with a specialist to choose the most appropriate treatment.",prostate cancer
"Annually, approximately 20 million men are prostate-specific-antigen screened, and 1.3 million undergo an invasive biopsy to diagnose roughly 200,000 new cases, 50% of which end up being indolent. Approximately 30,000 men die of prostate cancer (PCa) yearly. Importantly, an estimated US$8 billion is spent on unnecessary biopsies. Thus, an integrative analysis and predictive model of prognosis is needed to help identify only lethal and aggressive forms of the disease.",prostate cancer
"Although widely used, the value of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the detection of prostate cancer is controversial. The percentage of free PSA increases the specificity of PSA, but results are not enough. Prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) has been proposed as an option that may complement these markers in the detection and management of early prostate cancer. Our aim has been to review the value of PCA3 as tumor marker. The available results suggest that PCA3 is particularly useful to select in which patients the biopsy should be repeated when the first biopsy was negative. However, some points should be specified with further studies, including the most appropriate PCA3 cutoff level and the significance of a high PCA3 score in patients with negative biopsy. False-negative results are also a conflictive point in the use of PCA3, because prostate cancer, including aggressive tumors, may be present in patients with a low PCA3 score. Probably, a proper interpretation of this test requires its management together with other tests, through multivariate models for the detection of prostate cancer. On the other hand, several studies showed the relation between PCA3 score and Gleason score, and also the utility of PCA3 to select patients for active surveillance. To summarize, the available studies show the utility of PCA3 in the detection and management of early prostate cancer, although some aspects referred to its use need to be retested after further studies to confirm the actual value and the limitations of this test.",prostate cancer
"Age-adjusted mortality rates from prostate cancer between 1991 and 1995 are approximately two times worse among African-American men than Caucasian men. Age-specific mortality rates from prostate cancer are reported to be three times greater among African-American men compared with Caucasian men between the ages of 40 and 60 years. These statistics lead one to ask whether the difference in outcome is secondary to a more rapidly growing prostate cancer among African-American men compared with Caucasian men, or is it a result of delayed diagnosis among African-American men, which would account for there being more advanced prostate cancer at presentation? This report demonstrates many histological and biological differences that may account for clinical outcome differences.",prostate cancer
"Tissue microarray (TMA) technology is a method for high-throughput analysis of tissue biomarkers, commonly used in translational cancer research. TMAs allow performing a variety of in situ applications on hundreds of tissue samples simultaneously using the same protocols as for conventional slides. Thereby, precious material from patient samples remains largely preserved while costs in resources and time in laboratory processing decrease. Therefore, a TMA is a powerful tool to identify and study biomarkers that may have a potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive value. Depending on the research question, there are different types of TMAs, such as progression TMA, outcome TMA, and tumor heterogeneity TMA. Since the first introduction of the TMA method almost 20 years ago, most laboratories used manual tissue arrayers for manufacturing. Nowadays, automatic or semiautomatic devices are commercially available, which largely facilitates the technical construction. However, preparatory work remains the most time-consuming part in preparing TMAs. This chapter focuses on issues involved in design and construction of prostate cancer TMAs.",prostate cancer

"Objectives: Efforts to improve the clinical outcome for patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer have led to the development of neoadjuvant systemic therapies. We review the different modalities of neoadjuvant therapies for localized prostate cancer and highlight emerging treatment approaches including immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Methods: We performed a PubMed search of clinical trials evaluating preoperative systemic therapies for treating high-risk prostate cancer published after 2000, and those studies with the highest clinical relevance to current treatment approaches were selected for review. The database at clinicaltrials.gov was queried for neoadjuvant studies in high-risk prostate cancer, and those evaluating novel targeted therapies and immunotherapies are spotlighted here. Results: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become standard of care for treating some malignancies, including breast and bladder cancers. In prostate cancer, preoperative hormonal therapy or chemotherapy has failed to demonstrate improvements in overall survival. Nevertheless, the emergence of novel treatment modalities such as targeted small molecules and immunotherapy has spawned neoadjuvant clinical trials that provide a unique vantage from which to study mechanism of action and biological potency. Tissue-based biomarkers are being developed to elucidate the biological efficacy of these treatments. With targeted therapy, these can include phospho-proteomic signatures of target pathway activation and deactivation. With immunotherapies, including sipuleucel-T and ipilimumab, recruitment of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment can also be used as robust markers of a biological effect. Such studies can provide insight not only into mechanism of action for these therapies but can also provide paths forward to improving clinical efficacy like with rationally designed combinations and dose selection. Conclusions: The use of neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy and chemotherapy either singly or in combination before radical prostatectomy is generally safe and feasible while reducing prostate volume and tumor burden. However, pathologic complete response rates are low and no long-term survival benefit has been observed with the addition of neoadjuvant therapies over surgery alone at present, and therefore preoperative therapy is not the current standard of care in prostate cancer treatment.",prostate cancer
"There have been many significant advances in the treatment of prostate cancer, yet it remains a growing problem for men's health. Many men die from prostate cancer each year and many more live with non-cancerous, but debilitating, prostate disorders. This article discusses advanced (metastatic) prostate cancer, provides nurses with an overview of treatment options available to men with this condition, and offers a starting point from which to examine further evidence. It aims to encourage nurses to ensure that the patient is involved in making any decisions that could potentially impact on his health and wellbeing. In line with current thinking, the patient must be at the heart of every decision and be provided with greater choice and control (Department of Health, 2010).",prostate cancer
"Introduction: While metastatic prostate cancer remains an incurable tumor, remarkable progress has been made with novel drug design strategies for this incurable disease. Several new agents, including hormonal analogues, cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, radionuclides and innovative targeted therapies, have recently been approved by the FDA for use in advanced and/or metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Furthermore, a growing number of new diagnostic or predictive genetic tests have also been incorporated into the management of this disease. Immunotherapy-based approaches have shown promise and have led to drug approvals. Other experimental approaches such as vascular targeting are in early translational clinical trials. Areas covered: Herein, the authors outline select state-of-the-art approaches in the field. They also discuss the current challenges and future opportunities in the medical care of prostate cancer patients. Expert opinion: An inherent challenge in the treatment of prostate cancer is to determine which patients need immediate aggressive treatment versus active surveillance. For patients needing aggressive treatment, integrating the sequence of therapeutic interventions, to provide the most benefit, remains a challenge that clinicians face. Recently, several genetic tests have been approved, facilitating early treatment decisions. Innovative targeted therapies are moving towards clinical applications, providing treatment options for tumors previously considered refractory to androgen ablation treatment.",prostate cancer
"Cannabinoids, their receptors and their metabolizing enzymes are emerging as a new regulatory system, which is involved in multiple physiological functions. Normal prostate tissue expresses several constituents of the endocannabinoid system including the CB(1) receptor, receptors belonging to the transient receptor potential family and fatty acid amide hydrolase, a hydrolyzing enzyme, all of which have been localized in the glandular epithelia. Accumulating evidence indicate that the endocannabinoid system is dysregulated in prostate cancer, suggesting that it has a role in prostate homeostasis. Overexpression of several components of the endocannabinoid system correlate with prostate cancer grade and progression, potentially providing a new therapeutic target for prostate cancer. Moreover, several cannabinoids exert antitumoral properties against prostate cancer, reducing xenograft prostate tumor growth, prostate cancer cell proliferation and cell migration. Although the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids against prostate cancer is very promising, future research using animal models is needed to evaluate the influence of systemic networks in their antitumoral action.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer continues to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer among Canadian men. The introduction of routine screening and advanced treatment options have allowed for a decrease in prostate cancer-related mortality, but outcomes following treatment continue to vary widely. In addition, the overtreatment of indolent prostate cancers causes unnecessary treatment toxicities and burdens health care systems. Accurate identification of patients who should undergo aggressive treatment, and those which should be managed more conservatively, needs to be implemented. More tumour and patient information is needed to stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups to guide treatment options. This paper reviews the current literature on personalised prostate cancer management, including targeting tumour hypoxia, genomic and radiomic prognosticators, and radiobiological tumour targeting. A review of the current applications and future directions for the use of big data in radiation therapy is also presented. Prostate cancer management has a lot to gain from the implementation of personalised medicine into practice. Using specific tumour and patient characteristics to personalise prostate radiotherapy in the era of precision medicine will improve survival, decrease unnecessary toxicities, and minimise the heterogeneity of outcomes following treatment.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer and frequent cause of cancer-related mortality in men worldwide. Despite its commonness, the underlying molecular mechanism of prostate cancer is not completely understood. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are being implicated in the complex network of an apparent cancer initiatome and hundreds of lncRNAs are differentially expressed in various types of cancer including prostate cancer. While many lncRNAs exhibit oncogenic function and are named ""Onco-lncRNAs"", only a few lncRNAs inhibit cell proliferation or induce apoptosis and, hence, act as tumor suppressors. In this review, we highlight recent findings of emerging roles for lncRNAs in prostate cancer and discuss rapid translational lncRNA research for clinical application in diagnosis, prognosis and potential treatment.",prostate cancer
"The stem cell concept of cancer suggests that each cancer contains a small fraction of stem cells responsible for the maintenance and progression of the disease. The implication of this concept is that by targeting and killing the cancer stem cells, it may be possible to improve survival or even cure the disease. Prostate cancer stem cell therapy is a valid goal to aim for, but there are massive hurdles to overcome, even if the concept is shown to be correct.",prostate cancer
"Purpose/objectives: To review the clinical manifestations, current treatment, and nursing management of prostate cancer. Data sources: Published articles, book chapters, American Cancer Society booklets. Data synthesis: Prostate cancer is a slow-growing malignancy and usually is asymptomatic in its early stages. It causes acute urinary obstruction at more advanced stages, and patients may present with metastatic disease. Diagnosis is made by biopsy, and treatment options include periodic observation, surgery, radiotherapy hormonal manipulation, and chemotherapy with standard or investigational drugs or combination therapy. The major complications associated with surgery and radiation therapy are transient or permanent incontinence and impotence. Conclusions: Because no definitive method for identifying clinically important lesions exists, much controversy surrounds prostate cancer treatment. Issues significant to the diagnosis and treatment of all stages of prostate cancer are identified, and nursing care concerns focusing on treatment and disease-related problems are presented. Implications for nursing practice: Nursing care focuses on providing patients with accurate information to make informed decisions regarding treatment for early stage disease, on promoting comfort, and on preventing and managing treatment and disease-related complications. Nursing diagnoses include knowledge deficit; altered sexual patterns, body image disturbance, altered urinary elimination, diarrhea, impaired skin integrity, and pain, fatigue, bleeding, and infection, all of which are related to surgery, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and edema of the scrotum/lower extremities.",prostate cancer
"Improvements in diagnostic techniques have led to prostate cancer being diagnosed in younger patients and at an earlier stage of disease. The question therefore arises as to what is the best treatment for early prostate cancer. The main issues to be considered are whether the cancer is likely to progress quicker if these patients do not receive early treatment and what the quality of life implications are for patients receiving early treatment. As yet, due to the lack of valid comparisons of treatments, there is no clear ""best treatment"" for early prostate cancer. A number of clinical trials, comparing current treatments or investigating potential new treatment options for early prostate cancer, are in progress. The results of these should clarify the relative benefits of currently available treatments. This article reviews the latest information on the incidence, prognosis and current treatments for early prostate cancer and discusses the need for new treatments. Potential clinical benefits and cost implications of new treatments for early prostate cancer, such as improved surgical and radiotherapy techniques and adjuvant medical therapy, are also evaluated.",prostate cancer
"Most men treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer will be cured of prostate cancer; however, some men will experience treatment failure. Androgen deprivation therapy is well established in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy, following prostatectomy and/or radiotherapy, has been studied in the high-risk prostate cancer setting to try to reduce the risk of recurrence and improve patient outcomes. In this review, we discuss the current data for neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy with androgen suppression, chemotherapy, and approaches with the newer hormonal agents.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death. The management of prostate cancer patients has become increasingly complex, consequently calling on the need for identifying and validating prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Growing evidence indicates that microRNAs play a crucial role in the pathobiology of neoplastic diseases. The deregulation of the cellular ""miRNome"" in prostate cancer has been connected with multiple tumor-promoting activities such as aberrant activation of growth signals, anti-apoptotic effects, prometastatic mechanisms, alteration of the androgen receptor pathway, and regulation of the cancer stem cell phenotype. With the elucidation of molecular mechanisms controlled by microRNAs, investigations have been conducted in an attempt to exploit these molecules in the clinical setting. Moreover, the multifaceted biological activity of microRNAs makes them an attractive candidate as anticancer agents. This review summarizes the current knowledge on microRNA deregulation in prostate cancer, and the rationale underlying their exploitation as cancer biomarkers and therapeutics.",prostate cancer
"Although tobacco use has been recognized as one of the leading causes of cancer morbidity and mortality, a role of smoking in the occurrence of prostate cancer has not been established. However, evidence indicates that factors that influence the incidence of prostate cancer may differ from those that influence progression and fatality from the disease. Thus, we reviewed and summarized results from prospective cohort studies that assessed the relation between smoking and fatal prostate cancer risk, as well as epidemiological and clinical studies that focused on aggressive behavior in prostate cancer, such as poorer survival, advanced stage, or poorer differentiation at diagnosis. The majority of the prospective cohort studies showed that current smoking is associated with a moderate increase of ~30% in fatal prostate cancer risk compared to never/non-smokers. This association is likely to be an underestimate of the effect of smoking because most studies had a single assessment of smoking at baseline and long follow-up times, and the association was considerably stronger in some sub-groups of heaviest smokers, or when smoking was assessed in a relatively short period (within 10 years) prior to cancer mortality. Using aggressive behavior of prostate cancer as outcome, current smoking was associated with significantly elevated risk, ranging from around twofold to threefold or higher. Although alternative explanations, such as publication bias, residual confounding, screening bias, and the influence of smoking-related comorbidities cannot be ruled out entirely, these findings suggest that smoking is associated with aggressive behavior of prostate cancers or with a sub-group of rapidly progressing prostate cancer. Based on evidence presented in this review, cigarette smoking is likely to be a risk factor for prostate cancer progression and should be considered as a relevant exposure in prostate cancer research and prevention of mortality from this cancer.",prostate cancer
Objectives: The first summary of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on prostate cancer was published in 2001. These guidelines have been continuously updated since many important changes affecting the clinical management of patients with prostate cancer have occurred over the past years. The aim of this paper is to present a summary of the 2005 update of the EAU guidelines on prostate cancer. Methods: A literature review of the new data has been performed by the working panel. The guidelines have been updated and level of evidence/grade of recommendation added to the text. This enables readers to better understand the quality of the data forming the basis of the recommendations. Results: A full version is available at the EAU Office or at . Systemic prostate biopsies under ultrasound guidance is the preferred diagnostic method and the use of periprostatic injection of a local anaesthetic can significantly reduce pain/discomfort associated with the procedure. Active treatment (surgery or radiation) is mostly recommended for patients with localized disease and a long life expectancy with radical prostatectomy being the only treatment evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Follow-up is at large based on prostate specific antigen (PSA) and a disease-specific history with imaging only indicated when symptoms occur. Cytotoxic therapy has become an option for selected patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. Conclusion: The knowledge in the field of prostate cancer is rapidly changing. These EAU guidelines on prostate cancer summarize the most recent findings and put them into clinical practice.,prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer screening had led to the diagnosis of a large proportion of localized and low-risk disease. Many of these cancer cases are believed to be indolent and would not be clinically perceived in the absence of screening. In addition to that, the wide use of active treatment has exposed these patients to treatment-related quality-of-life impact. In this setting active surveillance as a way of deferring active treatment and reserving such treatment to cases of disease progression only has gained interest. PSA has been widely used to identify patients eligible for active surveillance and also for disease monitoring. The goal of this review was to describe the place of PSA in the monitoring of patients under active surveillance based on the existing studies and to discuss the importance of PSA in light of other existing or emerging tools to monitor prostate cancer in active surveillance.",prostate cancer
"Anaemia is a frequent complication of prostate cancer and of its treatments. In Europe prostate cancer accounts for the 10.8% of all malignant neoplasms. Iatrogenic hypogonadism and age-related physiologic changes along with nutritional deficits contribute to increase prevalence of prostate cancer related anaemia. The reason of the present review is to provide clinicians with all aspects of a frequent and multifactorial co-morbidity, whose effects are often underestimated. Erythropoiesis pathology and causes of anaemia in prostate cancer are reviewed. Critical issues of clinical management of anaemia in prostate cancer are discussed.",prostate cancer
"Although prostate cancer is among the most common male cancers, little information is available on risk factors. The paper reviews trends in prostate cancer incidence, and possible risk factors are discussed. Incidence appears to have peaked and is predicted to stabilize at a higher level due to screening. Besides heredity, epidemiological studies on prostate cancer produce equivocal results. Lifestyle and environment are likely to have an important impact on prostate cancer risk, but significant and clinically relevant risk factors have yet to be identified.",prostate cancer
"The first edition of Clinical Practice Guidelines for Prostate Cancer was created mainly by the Japanese Urological Association as a part of the 2003-2004 Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) Scientific Research Fund-supported Thorough Researches for the Evaluation of Medical Technologies. The guidelines were aimed to be used by general urologists committed to the treatment of all stages of prostate cancer patients. The guidelines supervised by the Japanese Urological Association were published in May 2006. The present edition of the guidelines are accepted as a good summary of prostate cancer treatment. However, since the present edition is over 3 years old, a revision of the guidelines is planned to update the contents and findings. In this article, I will summarize the changes and updates in each field.",prostate cancer
"Advances in diagnosis mean that prostate cancer can be detected in the early stages, when options such as surgery and radiotherapy offer curative approaches and active surveillance is appropriate. However, advanced or metastatic disease continues to challenge medical management, which offers only palliative approaches. With such a prognosis, effective treatment of metastatic and metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is an important element of the management of these patients. The second article of this two-part series focuses on the main management approaches, emerging therapies and nursing roles.",prostate cancer
"In the last decade, many systemic therapies have become available to improve survival in the setting of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Once effective treatments for advanced and incurable disease have been established, these agents are generally explored in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings to evaluate their role in increasing the chance of cure for localised disease. Clinical trials evaluating new therapies in high-risk prostate cancer can broadly be divided into two categories. Phase III (and some phase II) trials generally evaluate treatments that have already been shown to provide clinical benefit in the advanced disease setting; whereas smaller phase I (and some phase II) trials often serve as proof-of-principle assessments in the development of novel agents. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of present and ongoing clinical trials of both of these categories, evaluating the promise of systemic therapies in the setting of high-risk localised prostate cancer. We undertook a search of Ovid Medline, Embase and clinicaltrials.gov for prospective clinical studies assessing systemic therapy for early stage prostate cancer, either before or after definitive local treatment (surgery or radiation) from 2000 onwards. This resulted in 53 studies, of which 29 were deemed worthy of this overview and are presented herein, broadly divided by mechanism of action. Clearly, the arena evaluating the future of systemic therapies for localised prostate cancer will be a very active one.",prostate cancer
"Epidemiological studies suggest that environmental factors may mediate the transformation of latent prostate cancer into clinically apparent tumors and that diet appears to influence this progression. Close correlations between average per capita fat intake and prostate cancer mortality internationally generated interest in underlying mechanisms for this link, such as through serum levels of androgens, free radicals, proinflammatory fatty acid metabolites, or insulin-like growth factor. Much interest currently lies in the potential of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) to play a chemopreventative role in prostate cancer. Lycopene, a potent antioxidant found in tomatoes, may exert a protective effect in the prostate. Selenium and vitamin E have also been shown to decrease the risk of prostate cancer in some men. Calcium may support vitamin D-related antiproliferative effects in prostate cancer. Certain soy proteins, common in the Asian diet, have been shown to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. Finally, green tea may also have a chemopreventive effect by inducing apoptosis. Despite confounding factors present in clinical studies assessing the effect of diet on cancer risk, the data remain compelling that a variety of nutrients may prevent the development and progression of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The incidence of prostate cancer continues to increase in the US. Compared with other common cancers such as those of the breast and lung, the causes of prostate cancer remain poorly understood. Research endeavors continue to identify predictors of risk for prostate cancer, of which familial and genetic factors are among the strongest. Known risk factors can show significant heterogeneity in their association with prostate cancer development. However, the identification and further characterization of risk modifiers might provide insight into treatment and prevention of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"1. When obtaining a screening history for prostate cancer, important risk factors include age, family history, and ethnicity. The digital rectal examination remains the ""gold standard"" physical examination screening technique. 2. If prostate cancer is detected at an early stage, it is potentially curable. It is incumbent upon occupational health care providers to afford those constituents who fall into a high risk category, or who are > or = 40 years of age, every opportunity for prostate cancer screening. 3. Education is the ""sine-qua-non"" of complete health care provision for prostate cancer clients. The occupational health care provider can play a pivotal role in allaying a client's fear and misconception of this disease. 4. Providing appropriate assessment and advocacy for clients returning to the workplace following diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer is crucial.",prostate cancer
"Since they were first described in the 1990s, circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have provided an active and rapidly evolving area of current research that has the potential to transform cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. In particular, miRNAs could provide potential new biomarkers for prostate cancer, the most common cause of cancer in UK men. Current diagnostic tests for prostate cancer have low specificity and poor sensitivity. Further, although many prostate cancers are so slow growing as not to pose a major risk to health, there is currently no test to distinguish between these and cancers that will become aggressive and life threatening. Circulating miRNAs are highly stable and are both detectable and quantifiable in a range of accessible bio fluids, thus have the potential to be useful diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers. This review aims to summarise the current understanding of circulating miRNAs in prostate cancer patients and their potential role as biomarkers.",prostate cancer
"Focal therapy is an emerging treatment modality for localised prostate cancer that aims to reduce the morbidity seen with radical therapy, while maintaining cancer control. Focal therapy treatment strategies minimise damage to non-cancerous tissue, with priority given to the sparing of key structures such as the neurovascular bundles, external sphincter, bladder neck and rectum. There are a number of ablative technologies that can deliver energy to destroy cancer cells as part of a focal therapy strategy. The most widely investigated are cryotherapy and high-intensity focussed ultrasound. Existing radical therapies, such as brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy, also have the potential to be applied in a focal manner. The functional outcomes of focal therapy from several phase I and II trials have been encouraging, with low rates of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Robust medium- and long-term cancer control outcomes are currently lacking. Controversies in focal therapy remain, notably treatment paradigms based on the index lesion hypothesis, appropriate patient selection for focal therapy and how the efficacy of focal therapy should be assessed. This review articles discusses the current status of focal therapy, highlighting controversies and emerging strategies that can influence treatment outcomes for the future.",prostate cancer
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in focal treatment for prostate cancer. Although widely used for the treatment of tumors of the breast and kidney, focal treatment for prostate cancer remains a controversial area. Criticism of focal prostate therapy has been based on the fact that prostate cancer is a multifocal disease. Until now, little attention has been paid to distinguishing between men with unifocal and those with multifocal disease because such information has little clinical relevance when treatment is aimed at the whole gland irrespective of the volume or number of cancers in the prostate. In this Review, we summarize existing knowledge and examine the issue of prostate cancer focality in the context of focal treatment.",prostate cancer
"Obesity is a complex, chronic disease that has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Obesity is now linked with numerous health conditions, including many oncologic diagnoses. Its association with prostate cancer, the most prevalent cancer in men, has also been investigated, with studies suggesting a direct relationship between increasing obesity and prostate cancer mortality. Outcomes data for specific interventions in obese patients with prostate cancer have only recently begun to emerge. Surgery, while feasible even in the very obese, may result in less than optimal cancer control rates. Brachytherapy data are emerging, and are promising. No outcomes data are available for the use of external-beam radiation in obese patients. Long-term data for external-beam radiation, as well as for surgery and brachytherapy, are required to determine the most appropriate treatment for obese patients with prostate cancer. These data, coupled with a more thorough understanding of the biochemical relationship between obesity and prostate cancer, will be necessary to make optimal management decisions for obese patients with prostate cancer in the future.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancers have a justified reputation as one of the most heterogeneous human tumours. Indeed, there are some who consider that advanced and castration-resistant prostate cancers are incurable, as a direct result of this heterogeneity. However, tumour heterogeneity can be defined in different ways. To a clinician, prostate cancer is a number of different diseases, the treatments for which remain equally heterogeneous and uncertain. To the pathologist, the histopathological appearances of the tumours are notoriously heterogeneous. Indeed, the genius of Donald Gleason in the 1960s was to devise a classification system designed to take into account the heterogeneity of the tumours both individually and in the whole prostate context. To the cell biologist, a prostate tumour consists of multiple epithelial cell types, inter-mingled with various fibroblasts, neuroendocrine cells, endothelial cells, macrophages and lymphocytes, all of which interact to influence treatment responses in a patient-specific manner. Finally, genetic analyses of prostate cancers have been compromised by the variable gene rearrangements and paucity of activating mutations observed, even in large numbers of patient tumours with consistent clinical diagnoses and/or outcomes. Research into familial susceptibility has even generated the least tractable outcome of such studies: the genetic loci are of low penetrance and are of course heterogeneous. By fractionating the tumour (and patient-matched non-malignant tissues) heterogeneity can be resolved, revealing homogeneous markers of patient outcomes.",prostate cancer
"Functional radionuclide imaging modalities, now commonly combined with anatomical imaging modalities computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]/CT, positron emission tomography [PET]/CT, and PET/magnetic resonance imaging), are promising tools for the management of prostate cancer, particularly for therapeutic implications. Sensitive detection capability of prostate cancer using these imaging modalities is one issue; however, the treatment of prostate cancer using the information that can be obtained from functional radionuclide imaging techniques is another challenging area. There are not many SPECT or PET radiotracers that can cover the full spectrum of the management of prostate cancer from initial detection to staging, prognosis predictor, and all the way to treatment response assessment. However, when used appropriately, the information from functional radionuclide imaging improves, and sometimes significantly changes, the whole course of the cancer management. The limitations of using SPECT and PET radiotracers with regard to therapeutic implications are not so much different from their limitations solely for the task of detecting prostate cancer; however, the specific imaging target and how this target is reliably imaged by SPECT and PET can potentially make significant impact in the treatment of prostate cancer. Finally, although the localized prostate cancer is considered manageable, there is still significant need for improvement in noninvasive imaging of metastatic prostate cancer, in treatment guidance, and in response assessment from functional imaging, including radionuclide-based techniques. In this review article, we present the rationale of using functional radionuclide imaging and the therapeutic implications for each of radionuclide imaging agent that have been studied in human subjects.",prostate cancer
"The diagnosis of localized prostate cancer is in constant modification. Recent studies on early diagnosis and prognosis analysis have demonstrated the limits of using PSA. The challenge for the upcoming years will be to adapt therapeutic strategies for each patient according to more reliable tests. These objectives apply for DNA methylation analysis. Hypermethylation of the promoter of gene implicated in the carcinogenesis of prostate cancer has been shown as an interesting filed for new tests. So far, DNA methylation tests were assessed on small cohorts of localized prostate cancer patients with promising results when applied on primary tumours and in urine, particularly for patients at high risk of progression after radical prostatectomy. Since the last phase of development for DNA methylation tests will be the industrialization and evaluation on large scale, it is important to have a synthesis on current knowledge of DNA methylation tests in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancers are genetically and phenotypically heterogenous. The heterogeneous nature of prostate cancer may be a consequence of mutations in different cell types (basal stem, transit amplifying or luminal cells) resulting in different malignant maturation pathways. One consistent characterization of these cancers, however, is their eventual progression to a hormonal refractory state. The development of effective novel therapeutic strategies requires an understanding of the mechanisms for the development of such a refractory state. Targeting proliferative and survival pathways provides a rationale for drug design and development for hormone refractory prostate cancer. Prostate cancer cells, however, develop an enhanced redundancy in downstream survival signaling. Hence, new combinational therapies must be developed with the understanding that compensatory mechanisms evolve under selective pressure.",prostate cancer
"Proteomics has offered the hope of biomarker discovery to improve the management of prostate cancer. Markers are needed for screening and diagnosis, distinguishing latent from aggressive disease, defining the men who will benefit from therapy, differentiating localized from metastatic disease, predicting outcome and identifying new targets for therapy. There are many potential sources of proteins derived from the prostate, including urine, prostatic fluid (expressed or ejaculate), serum, and plasma or tissue, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Equally, there are many methodological platforms for proteomic studies of the prostate. Despite the promise, protoemics has yielded little of relevance to the management of prostate cancer, and most of the work that has been published is either irreproducible or of no clinical value.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a significant cause of death among men of all races in the United States, and it does disproportionately affect Black men. This disease poses a number of questions that desperately need answers. These questions involve not just the cause and prevention of the prostate cancer, but a very real and valid question is ""does screening for and aggressive treatment of prostate cancer save lives."" Almost all questions in prostate cancer are not questions unique to blacks or whites, or any specific population. These questions can only be answered through well-designed basic and clinical research studies. This research must be supported by both physician and patient participation. Conveying truthful, accurate information in this disease in which so much is unanswered is imperative. In American medical history, black men have often been misled or misinformed oftentimes by well-meaning paternalistic individuals. Physicians and laymen teaching about this disease must themselves realize and then truthfully convey ""what is known, what is not known, and what is believed."" This will allow the layman to make educated decisions regarding screening, treatment, and participation in clinical studies.",prostate cancer
"Background/aim: Androgen-androgen receptor (AR) signal is known as a powerful driver of prostate cancer progression. We previously reported the limitation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis as a prognostic biomarker of prostate cancer. Although serum total testosterone (TT) level has been reported as a prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer, its usability is still controversial. We examined the potential and characteristics of TT as a biomarker. Patients and methods: Serum TT levels of patients who underwent prostate biopsy were measured, and prostate cancer-specific survival (PCaSS), overall survival (OS), and the correlation between staging and serum TT level were analyzed. Results: Of 379 biopsied patients, 255 were diagnosed with prostate cancer. The patients were divided into five groups according to their serum TT levels; patients with serum TT levels of <2 or ≥8 ng/ml (ENDs) had worse PCaSS and OS compared with those with middle serum TT levels between 2 and 8 ng/ml (MIDs). Moreover, ENDs showed a tendency of having castration-resistant cancer with advanced stage (T4 or N1 or M1). The TNM stage in ENDs was significantly higher than in MIDs. Conclusion: Although low serum TT level has been reported to indicate worse outcome in patients with prostate cancer, this study showed that both low as well as high serum TT levels indicate poor prognosis.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed noncutaneous cancer in men in Western countries. As in the normal prostate, the initial stages of prostate cancer progression depend on androgens that increase proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. Androgen-deprivation therapy is the major course of treatment in recurrent and metastatic prostate cancer. However, in most cases prostate cancer progresses to an apoptosis-resistant androgen-independent stage for which there is no available therapy. It is therefore important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer progression, and how prostate cancer cells evade apoptotic mechanisms that give rise to their uncontrolled growth behavior. Here, we have reviewed the most important signaling pathways implicated in prostate cancer apoptosis and cell growth and how they may be deregulated during prostate cancer progression.",prostate cancer
"Since 1941, the understanding of prostate cancer pathogenesis and therapy has undergone a significant transformation. Rigorous translational research has identified multiple mechanisms underlying castration resistance, the fatal clinical state of the disease. Therapeutic approaches targeting these mechanisms in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer have now been clinically validated in the clinic including high-potency androgen signaling inhibition, novel cytotoxic chemotherapy, and bone-targeted therapies. Despite these advances, cure remains an elusive goal. The natural history of metastatic prostate cancer has evolved particularly in the last 2 decades in step with improved management of age-associated comorbidities, improved imaging, and the expansion of novel therapies, thus providing new opportunities and challenges. It is also important to note that the advent of prostate-specific antigen testing caused a stage shift in the disease spectrum, thus leading to earlier interventions and potentially positively impacting survival. The optimal sequencing and combinations of available therapies, predictive biomarkers, and better understanding of mechanisms of resistance remain high priority. Further refinement of the clinical niche for novel therapies in hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant disease through rationally designed clinical trials incorporating molecular, clinical, and imaging biomarkers and quality-of-life correlatives is of paramount importance.",prostate cancer
"Background: The worldwide incidence of prostate cancer has been rising rapidly, likely due to intensified effort in early detection and screening. Intense effort is also directed at novel schemas of chemoprevention and therapy. Incidence data are insufficient to identify the true magnitude of prostate cancer in a given population. The true prevalence of prostate cancer must be identified. Methods: We reviewed the latest worldwide epidemiologic data and clinical studies on prostate cancer studying the true prevalence of this disease. Results: The incidence of prostate cancer is increasing worldwide, with strong variation among regions. Prevalence studies based on autopsy data have confirmed a high frequency of latent prostate cancer in men of all ages. More aggressive screening measures using a lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) threshold, together with an increasing number of biopsies, have escalated the detection of these latent cancers. Conclusions: Recent improvements in prostate cancer detection narrow the gap between the incidence and true prevalence of prostate cancer. This, however, raises concerns about the risk of over detection of latent cancers and thus identifying a need for improvement in screening strategies to better identify clinically significant disease.",prostate cancer
"Objectives: Previously East Asian men had been considered less likely to develop or die of prostate cancer. Emerging research and the onset of prostate-specific antigen screening in East Asian countries suggests that this may not be the case. We sought to analyze epidemiology and molecular genetic data and recent trends in the management of prostate cancer among East Asian men. Methods and materials: We performed literature searches using PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar to examine current literature on prostate cancer in East Asian men. Additionally, articles were searched for further references related to the topic. Results: Recent studies have reported increasing incidence of prostate cancer identified in East Asian men. Prostate cancer mortality has increased and is currently the fourth leading cause of death among men in Shanghai, China. Although prostate cancer was considered less aggressive among East Asian men, studies suggest that it is similarly aggressive to prostate cancer in Western populations. Molecular markers such as the TEMPRESS:ERG fusion gene and PTEN loss may provide novel methods of screening East Asian men for prostate cancer. National-level guidelines for prostate cancer screening and management are only available in Japan. Conclusions: The prevalence of prostate cancer in East Asian men is likely similar to that in Western male populations. East Asian men present at higher stages of prostate cancer, likely because of a lack of standardized screening protocols. Urologists in Western countries should screen East Asian men for prostate cancer using the same standards as used for Western men.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in men. Screening with prostate specific antigen (PSA) has led to a clinical and pathological stage migration such that currently most men diagnosed with prostate cancer have clinically localized disease potentially offering opportunity for curative intervention. On the other hand, the benefit of radical therapy in terms of reducing overall mortality in PSA-screened populations has been controversial with concerns being raised about over-diagnosis and over-treatment. Treatment of prostate cancer is associated with risk and complications that negatively affect the quality of life of men with localized disease. Recently, a new treatment paradigm has been proposed which is called focal therapy, defined as an individualized treatment by which only known disease is targeted and ablated while preserving normal tissue. This review will attempt to describe the opportunities and uncertainties behind this proposed paradigm shift.",prostate cancer
"Numerous research groups are investigating the use of cancer vaccines as a potential therapeutic modality for various tumor types. The efficacy of cancer vaccines has improved because of advances in the characterization of tumor-associated antigens, the development of improved vaccine delivery systems, and the combination of vaccines with cytokines and other immunostimulants to enhance immune responses. Although cancer vaccines are under investigation for the treatment of various different tumor types, several characteristics of prostate cancer make it an ideal target for immunotherapy. The relative indolence of prostrate cancer allows sufficient time to generate immune responses, which usually take weeks or months to mount. In addition, prostate cancer-associated antigens direct the immune response to prostate cancer cells, thus sparing normal tissue. This review focuses on promising new strategies for combining vaccines with other therapeutic approaches, as well as novel perspectives in the treatment of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"There are few methods bringing several relatively recent advances in therapy of certain types of prostate cancer. Belonging to personalized therapies, they use cells (normal or pathologic) from the patient, modify and reintroduce them in the patient's body, leading to an increased efficiency against the neoplastic tissue, proving to increase the patient's lifespan and/ or tumor progression.",prostate cancer
"In patients with lymph node-positive and metastatic prostate cancer there is currently no consensus about the best possible management. Multimodal approaches including systemic and local treatment have shown to improve survival. However, the role of radical prostatectomy (RP) is currently unclear. While treatment of the primary tumor is recommended in highly selected lymph node-positive prostate cancer patients, no prospective data exist to support resection of the primary tumor in metastatic patients as a treatment modality to improve overall survival. However, recent observational studies have suggested a survival benefit after prostate tumor cytoreduction. This article reviews existing evidence on the role of RP in lymph node-positive and metastatic prostate cancer patients.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: The purpose of this report is to discuss the current treatment options available to the patient with prostate cancer in all stages of the disease. Overview: With the exception of skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United States. Most patients in the current era will present with organ-confined disease, amenable to curative treatment. Treatment for organ-confined disease includes watchful waiting, radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and cryosurgery in selective cases. Hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. There is no curative treatment for hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Clinical implications: The availability of several therapeutic options for localized prostate cancer warrants careful consideration when planning treatment with curative intent. Patients need to be active participants in decision making, and they must be aware of the benefits and possible complications of the different types of treatment. Patients with advanced prostate cancer need to be aware that hormone treatment will provide temporization and palliation in the majority of cases. Hormone-resistant prostate cancer is refractory to most forms of conventional and experimental therapy.",prostate cancer
"It is well-known that the interaction of both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms results in the formation of malignant tumor. Epigenetic mechanism includes DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNA regulation. DNA aberrant methylation (hypermethylation and hypomethylation), which leads to genomic instability and inappropriate gene expression, is the best-characterized alteration in prostate cancer. It plays an important role in the initiation and development of prostate cancer. Meanwhile, DNA methylation, as a hotspot in researches of epigenetics, would provide a new methodology and approach for early clinical diagnosis, prognosis and medication treatment of prostate cancer. According to recent studies on DNA hypermethylation and DNA hypomethylation, this review highlights the potential epigenetic mechanism of prostate cancer and discusses the latest research progress in clinical translation.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer remains the most common noncutaneous human malignancy, and the second most lethal tumor among men. However, the natural history of the disease is often prolonged, and the survival benefits of local therapy for men with low-risk tumors may not be realized for a decade or more, as is increasingly well demonstrated in long-term observational cohorts in both the United States and Europe. A significant proportion of men with prostate cancer may be overdiagnosed, in the sense that diagnosis may not improve their lifespan or quality of life. However, the extent to which overdiagnosis represents a true problem relates to the consistency with which diagnosis leads invariably to active treatment. Prostate cancer is diagnosed at progressively earlier stages and with lower risk features; despite these trends, patients are less likely now than a decade ago to undergo a trial of active surveillance. Rates of brachytherapy and hormonal therapy use, in particular, have risen markedly. Important progress has been made in recent years in prostate cancer risk assessment. These advances, in combination with biomarkers in later stages of development, should be expected in the coming years to yield further improvements in clinicians' ability to diagnose prostate cancer early, and guide appropriately selected patients toward increasingly tailored treatment.",prostate cancer
"The Notch signalling pathway plays a fundamental role in tissue development due to its involvement in cell fate determination and postnatal tissue differentiation. Its capacity to regulate cell growth and development has been linked to the occurrence of several cancers including that of the prostate. The transmembrane receptor Notch-1 of this pathway has been linked to the oncogenic role of Notch signalling in prostate adenocarcinoma. Other studies have suggested a tumour suppressive function for Notch-1. This review focuses on the role of Notch-1 in prostate cancer development and maintenance and relates this to the fundamental role of Notch in normal prostate development. The current understanding of the aberrant Notch signalling characteristic of prostate cancer is discussed, and recent therapeutic advances in this field are presented.",prostate cancer
"Recent advances need to be highlighted in the management of both localized and metastatic prostate cancer. New early detection and molecular characterization tools are being developed to improve differentiation of their progression profiles and reduce ""overdetection"" and ""overtreatment"" of clinically ""insignificant"" cancers. In addition, the development of multi-parametric MR has improved the characterization of localized cancer and introduced the new concept of focal treatment. Finally, several treatments for metastatic cancer which is resistant to castration have recently increased the therapeutic armamentarium.",prostate cancer
"The aim of this article is to selectively review the current research findings related to quality of life and prostate cancer. English-language journals indexed in MEDLINE, PubMed, and CINAHL published between 1999 and 2005 were searched for relevant articles using the following keywords: ""quality of life and prostate cancer,"" ""prostatectomy,"" ""radiation therapy,"" ""brachytherapy,"" ""cryotherapy,"" or ""androgen deprivation therapy."" References in selected articles were reviewed for potentially relevant articles not identified through database searches. All treatment modalities have a significant impact on quality of life for men with local or advanced prostate cancer. Alterations in sexual functioning cause the most significant impact on quality of life for men. Quality of life is decreased in both the short and long term for men with prostate cancer. Oncology nurses must be cognizant of the challenges that a diagnosis of prostate cancer presents to the man with prostate cancer and his partner. Patients should be fully informed of the potential for impact on quality of life with all treatment modalities, and the oncology nurse can play an important role in both providing this information and supporting the patient when quality of life is impacted.",prostate cancer
"Introduction: Localized prostate tumors have various clinical, biological and histopathological characteristics that lead to different progression profiles. High-risk prostate cancer has been classically defined by clinical examination, PSA levels and histopathological data. High-risk prostate cancer has usually a worse outcome, but classic stratification predictive of outcome for prostate cancer is a matter of debate concerning its accuracy. Methods: A systematic review of the literature on high-risk prostate cancer over the 15 last years was carried out on Medline database. The literature selection was based on evidence and practical considerations. Results: A great deal of scientific work have been deployed to prove that high-risk prostate cancer should be approached by teamwork including radio-hormone therapy, systemic treatment with long term use of LH-RH and a radical prostatectomy with adequate lymph node dissection. Selection of patients is essential to define individualized therapeutic strategy and timing for every modality should come as a consensus of medical supported evidence. Conclusion: Accurate patient selection and multimodal treatment offer the best therapeutic option in high-risk prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in men and can be managed effectively if diagnosed early and monitored. Currently, prostate-specific antigen testing in conjunction with a digital rectal exam has been utilized for screening at-risk men. However, the lack of specificity of prostate-specific antigen as a marker for prostate cancer combined with the asymptomatic and slow-growing nature of prostate tumors has resulted in many men being overdiagnosed and subjected to surgery or treatment with adverse side effects. The focus in the research community currently has been on discovering noninvasive surrogate markers such as proteins, circulating tumor cells and nucleic acids in the blood or urine of patients with prostate cancer. These markers, in combination with prostate-specific antigen, are providing promise that a personalized multiparametric approach to prostate cancer diagnosis and monitoring will aid in managing this disease.",prostate cancer
"Objective: To explore the expression of I-5α-reductase (SRD5A1)and its prognostic role in prostate cancer . Methods: Data about SRD5A1 were retrieved from the ONCOMINE database and the role of SRD5A1 in prostate cancer was analyzed. Results: Totally, 992 studies of different types relevant to the expression of SRD5A1 were identified in the ONCOMINE database. The SRD5A1 expression was statistically significant in 239 of the studies, overexpressed in 157 (11 in prostate cancer) and underexpressed in the other 82 (3 in prostate cancer). Eighteen of the studies, with 1 068 samples, addressed the expression of SRD5A1 in prostate cancer and normal tissues, which was significantly higher in the former than in the latter tissue (P<0.05). In 3 of the studies, the SRD5A1 expression was high in primary prostate cancer and increased with its metastasis (P<0.0 5). Two of the studies with prognostic data showed a higher rate of postoperative biochemical recurrence and a higher total mortality rate in the patients with a high than in those with a low expression of SRD5A1 (P<0.05). Conclusions: SRD5A1 is highly expressed in prostate cancer, especially in metastatic and castration-resistant prostate cancer and its expression is associated with the prognosis of prostate cancer, which may be an important target of medication for prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. Ability to detect this cancer early and availability of better prognostic markers are critical in order to decrease morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer. With the recent development in gene expression analysis methodology, expression profiles of thousands of genes can be generated in tissue samples and cell lines. Comparison of the global gene expression patterns between normal prostate and tumors at different stages may allow us to understand better the molecular mechanism of prostate tumorigenesis and progression. Different cancer cell lines and tissues appear to have different gene expression patterns that provide a new tool to classify tumors. Molecular classification of prostate cancer holds great promise for early detection and prognosis of this disease in the future. In this review, we summarize some of the recent mRNA and protein expression profiling studies performed in prostate cancer. Further, we discuss the potential benefits and limitations of current profiling technology.",prostate cancer
"Incidental prostate cancer (IPC)--cancer, identified by morphological evaluation of prostate tissue removed during transurethral resection (TUR) or open prostatectomy, in cases where the results of preoperative prostate biopsy revealed no prostate cancer. Literature review presents the data on the incidence of IPC, features of its diagnosis, prediction of tumor progression, and choice of treatment approaches. Many questions remain unresolved and require additional research.",prostate cancer
"The physical burden of prostate cancer is considerable and affects quality of life in men with both localized and metastatic disease. This physical impact results as much from treatment for prostate cancer as from the disease itself. In advanced disease, although patients can experience considerable pain and discomfort from bony lesions, they also can experience bothersome fatigue and sleep disturbances from institution of hormone ablation therapy. In localized disease, although patients can have lower urinary tract symptoms from untreated prostate cancer, all aggressive treatments can result in urinary, sexual, and bowel dysfunction that can bother the patient and affect quality of life. Patients and providers must be vigilantly aware of the physical burden of prostate cancer when initiating treatment for this disease and during follow up after treatment. By being cognizant of the physical impact of prostate cancer on quality of life, providers can address patients' problems early in their course of treatment and maximize patients' HRQOL and overall satisfaction with care.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in males. The current body of literature supports the role of nutritional products in the reduction of prostate cancer. This review critically addresses the natural products with the greatest potential to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, including lycopene, vitamin E, selenium, vitamin D, soy and green tea. The toxicities of the dietary products are addressed. The direction of future studies lies in clarifying the effects of these products and exploring the biological mechanisms responsible for the prevention of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate carcinoma is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in men in developed countries and the incidence has been steadily rising in the developing countries. Active research in recent years has led to tremendous progress in our understanding of the biology and genetics, and marked improvement in diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Gleason grading has remained as the cornerstone for management of patients with prostate cancer. However, the grading system has continuously evolving since its inception in response to changes in the clinical practice of diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. The modification of Gleason grading system implemented by the International Society of Urological Pathology in 2005 has profoundly changed the way prostate cancer is graded and consequently how patients are managed. Several prostate cancer histological types with distinct clinical and pathological features have been rediscovered or redefined. Finally, elucidations of the molecular and genetic mechanism helps not only better understand the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, but also identify biomarkers for improved diagnosis, risk stratification and clinical management. This article briefly reviews the most recent advances in the Gleason grading system, new histological types and molecular genetics of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Genetic studies have provided remarkable clues to the causes of prostate cancer (PCa). For example, in addition to the expected role of androgens in facilitating the development of PCa, the possibility that infections might lead to prostate cancer has been raised with the identification of RNASEL and MSR1 as familial prostate cancer genes; that insight will profoundly affect future studies and may ultimately lead to new approaches to the prevention of prostate cancer. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses, including GSTP1, growth factor signaling pathways (such as NKX3.1, PTEN and p27) and androgens as critical determinants of the phenotype of PCa cells and defines specific targets for detection, diagnosis and treatment of PCa.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: Diabetes mellitus is associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer. However, previous studies examining the associations between diabetes mellitus and prostate cancer prognosis have produced mixed results. Here, we aim to summarize the effect of diabetes mellitus on prostate cancer prognosis. Methods: We searched the database of PubMed from inception through 31 March 2014 for articles evaluating the effect of diabetes on outcome in prostate cancer patients, and a meta-analysis was conducted. Results: A total of 11 cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis, of which seven studies were carried out to investigate whether diabetes mellitus is associated with all-cause mortality amongst those with prostate cancer, seven studies to investigate whether diabetes mellitus is associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality and two studies to investigate the relationship of diabetes mellitus and nonprostate cancer mortality. The meta-analysis results suggested that diabetes mellitus could significantly affect the incidence of all-cause mortality amongst those with prostate cancer (hazard ratio = 1.50, 95% confidence interval = 1.25-1.79). Besides, diabetes mellitus was also associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio = 1.26, 95% confidence interval = 1.20-1.33) and nonprostate cancer mortality (hazard ratio = 1.83, 95% confidence interval = 1.33-2.52) separately. There was no obvious publication bias amongst the studies included. Conclusion: The results of this meta-analysis reveal an association of diabetes mellitus with adverse prognosis amongst those with prostate cancer. The biological basis of the association of diabetes mellitus with prostate cancer incidence and prognosis remains unclear. Doctors could pay more attention to prostate patients with pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and more aggressive treatment regimens should be considered.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is one of the major malignant diseases in Western countries. In Japan, the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer is not so high, but is continuously increasing. The recent drastic increase in incidence has been attributed to the growth of the elderly population, a westernized diet in daily life, widespread environmental contamination, and improved screening techniques such as the serum PSA test. The epidemiology of prostate cancer hints that its etiology is both environmental and genetic. Androgenic stimulation over time, perhaps due to a high fat diet, has been suggested as a cause of prostate cancer. Dietary factors such as phytoestrogens, vitamins and trace elements are suggested to have a protective effect against prostate cancer, and encourage us to search for means of prevention. Some have suggested that certain polymorphisms increase the risk of prostate cancer, whereas others are searching for genetic mutations that may also increase prostate cancer risk. The cause of prostate cancer is likely to be a combination of environmental and genetic factors.",prostate cancer
"Substantial evidence now supports the view that epigenetic changes have a role in the development of human prostate cancer. Analyses of the patterns of epigenetic alteration are providing important insights into the origin of this disease and have identified specific alterations that may serve as useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Examination of cancer methylation patterns supports a stem cell origin of prostate cancer. It is well established that methylation of GSTpi is a marker of prostate cancer, and global patterns of histone marking appear to be linked to cancer prognosis with levels of acetylated histones H3K9, H3K18, and H4K12, and of dimethylated H4R3 and H3K4, dividing low-grade prostate cancer (Gleason 6 or less) into two prognostically separate groups. Elevated levels of several components of the polycomb group protein complex, EZH2, BMI1, and RING1, can also act as biomarkers of poor clinical outcome. Many components of the epigenetic machinery, including histone deacetylase (whose expression level is linked to the TMPRSS2:ERG translocation) and the histone methylase EZH2, are potential therapeutic targets. The recent discovery of the role of small RNAs in governing the epigenetic status of individual genes offers exciting new possibilities in therapeutics and chemoprevention.",prostate cancer
"From a clinical perspective, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a valuable target for both diagnosis and radioligand therapy (RLT) of prostate cancer. The term 'specific' has been used to characterize a histologic hallmark of overexpression in the membrane of most prostate cancer. Many PSMA ligands have been developed since the previous decade and have been used in several clinical trials and clinical studies. However, procedure, specification, protocol, interpretation criteria, radiation dose, and cost-effectiveness of PSMA ligands have not been fully explained. Regardless of worldwide use of promising PSMA-ligand PET and RLT, it has not been approved in Japan. Expedited introduction of PSMA-ligand PET and RLT to Japan and implementation of clinical study are eager for many patients with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a common disease amongst elderly men. Compared with younger patients, men over the age of 75 are more likely to present with advanced disease and have a greater risk of death from prostate cancer despite higher death rates from competing causes. Treatment options for advanced prostate cancer have improved considerably in the last two years. The immunotherapy sipuleucel-T, the cytotoxic cabazitaxel, the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate, the radioisotope radium-223 and the antiandrogen enzalutamide have all been shown to improve survival in randomized phase III studies for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This review will focus on the clinical data regarding new treatment developments specifically applied to elderly patients with advanced prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Epigenome alterations are characteristic of nearly all human malignancies and include changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications and microRNAs (miRNAs). However, what induces these epigenetic alterations in cancer is largely unknown and their mechanistic role in prostate tumorigenesis is just beginning to be evaluated. Identification of the epigenetic modifications involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer will not only identify novel therapeutic targets but also prognostic and diagnostic markers. This review will focus on the use of epigenetic modifications as biomarkers for prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
Recent advances in detection combined with increasingly effective treatment for prostate cancer has led to significant improvements in life expectancy. More men are living longer with the significant physical and emotional after-effects of prostate cancer treatment.,prostate cancer
"External beam radiotherapy is one of the curative treatment options for localised prostate cancer. This article will describe recent advances in prostate radiotherapy, focussing on the results of randomised trials which have addressed the role of radiation dose escalation and of adjuvant hormone therapy. Current controversies will then be considered, including the merits of radiotherapy in comparison with alternative approaches to early prostate cancer, and the possible role of adjuvant radiation following surgery. Finally, future developments will be described, including hypofractionation and dose individualisation, which have the potential to further improve the outcome of external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) act as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. This review examines current advances in the study of the role of miRNAs in cancer, including prostate cancer. Issues devoted to the nomenclature, biogenesis, the role of miRNAs as oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and their role in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of prostate cancer are discussed. Assessment ofthe role of miRNAs in the development of prostate cancer will promote early diagnosis and will be important for the development of new approaches to the disease treatment.",prostate cancer
"Patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) have several therapeutic options with good prognosis. However, survival of patients with high-risk, advanced PCa is significantly less than patients with early-stage, organ-confined disease. Testosterone and other androgens have been directly linked to PCa progression since 1941. In this review, we chronicle the discoveries that led to modern therapeutic strategies for PCa. Specifically highlighted is the biology of androgen receptor (AR), the nuclear receptor transcription factor largely responsible for androgen-stimulated and castrate-recurrent (CR) PCa. Current PCa treatment paradigms can be classified into three distinct but interrelated categories: targeting AR at pre-receptor, receptor, or post-receptor signaling. The continuing challenge of disease relapse as CR and/or metastatic tumors, destined to occur within three years of the initial treatment, is also discussed. We conclude that the success of PCa therapies in the future depends on targeting molecular mechanisms underlying tumor recurrence that still may affect AR at pre-receptor, receptor, and post-receptor levels.",prostate cancer
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Recent findings indicate that miRNAs are dysregulated in human tumors, suggesting a potential role for these molecules in the pathogenesis of cancer. Thus far, only a limited number of studies have investigated miRNA expression in prostate cancer. Results from these studies indicate that miRNA expression profiles may distinguish carcinoma from non-neoplastic specimens and further classify tumors according to androgen dependence. In addition, a prognostic significance was attributed to specific miRNAs as predictors of clinical recurrence following radical prostatectomy. For a handful of miRNAs, for which a widespread dysregulation in prostate cancer was consistently found, functional investigation has been pursued in prostate cancer experimental models to establish the rationale for the development of miRNA-based therapies. A better understanding of the role exerted by specific miRNAs in the development and progression of prostate cancer is needed, as is a precise definition of their targets relevant to the disease. However, based on available findings, a possible role for miRNAs in the management of prostate cancer as novel biomarkers and new therapeutic targets or intervention tools can be envisioned.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Western males, responsible for 3% of all deaths in men over 55 years of age and second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer death. Biomarkers have become an important diagnostic tool in prostate cancer. The discovery of the serum marker prostate-specific antigen (PSA) significantly facilitated the detection and management of prostate cancer. As we enter into the post-genomics era, novel biomarkers of prostate cancer of therapeutic significance will invariably emerge. Here we review a series of existing and emerging molecular-based prognostic markers particularly with radiotherapy.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: Prostate cancer continues to represent a major health problem. It represents the most common cancer in US men, with an estimated 186 320 new cases diagnosed in 2008. It is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States. Despite several attempts, the median survival for men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer is 1-2 years, with improvements in survival seen primarily with docetaxel-based therapies. Treatment options are limited, and there is a clear need for therapies that improve outcome. The purpose of this article is to discuss recent developments in the field of metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer, including new cytotoxic agents, antiproliferative agents, immune-based therapies, circulating tumor markers and antiangiogenic agents. Recent findings: During this last year, several promising approaches yielded disappointing results in the phase III setting (GVAX, satraplatin, DN-101); nonetheless, expectations for other agents (abiraterone, zibotentan, Provenge) still remain high. Summary: These new agents will need to demonstrate survival benefit for approval. Circulating tumor cells have been shown to provide important prognostic information and are anticipated to be incorporated in future clinical decision-making.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world and the third leading cause of cancer in men. The increase in the understanding of prostate carcinogenesis over the past 15 years has helped to define crucial steps in the natural history of the disease, namely initiation and progression to androgen independence. This heterogeneous disease encompasses a range of environmental and familial factors, which provides strong support for the use of chemopreventive strategies. Most patients with advanced prostate cancer are treated with androgen-deprivation therapy, which leads to a striking regression of androgen-responsive cancer cells. A transition from an androgen-responsive to an androgen-unresponsive stage is seen during the clinical course in almost all patients with prostate cancer. This transition also signals a substantial worsening of prognosis. Here, we review the most important findings in prostate carcinogenesis and the molecular anomalies associated with the androgen-refractory stage.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies in westernised countries. An alarming fact is that the incidence of prostate cancer is showing an upward trend. The author discusses the anatomy and physiology, epidemiology, aetiology and management of this disease.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is unique among the potentially lethal human malignancies in the wide discrepancy between the high prevalence of histologic changes recognizable as cancer and the much lower prevalence of the clinical disease. Despite the availability of effective tests for early detection and of effective treatment for cancers so detected, the diagnosis usually is not established until the tumor is locally advanced or metastatic. Yet, physicians hesitate to use these tests for fear that many cancers found would be latent, of little threat to the life or health of the host, and treatment could introduce inappropriate morbidity. Latent or ""clinically unimportant"" cancers can be distinguished from those that are clinically important by the larger volume, higher grade, and greater invasiveness of the latter. The available tests can detect only those cancers large enough to be palpable, visible on ultrasound, or capable of elevating the serum level of prostate-specific antigen. Such cancers are clinically important and should be treated for cure if the life expectancy of the patient is sufficiently long and the morbidity rate of therapy is low. Early detection of prostate cancer using the tests that are available today may widen the window of opportunity so that treatment indeed becomes possible in those for whom it is necessary.",prostate cancer
"Localized prostate cancer demonstrates tremendous heterogeneity in the natural history of the disease. To this end, although prostate cancer may be present histologically in nearly 30% of all men above the age of 50 y, the lifetime risk of developing clinically significant disease is 18% (one in six). Furthermore, the lifetime risk of dying from prostate cancer is less than 4%. Therefore, in order to avoid unnecessarily treating potentially insignificant prostate cancer, the concept of expectant management has been considered for this disease. In this brief review, we discuss the evolution of expectant management for men with localized prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Active surveillance (AS) has been introduced as an observational strategy to delay or avoid curative treatment without compromising long-term cancer-specific survival. The 10 studies included in this review, published between 2008 and 2013, generally agreed upon patients selection for the AS strategy and how they should be managed within the program. However, uncertainties persists concerning optimal patient selection and reliable progression criteria, as well as the long-term safety of AS.",prostate cancer
"Effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer is critically needed. The present study was aimed at identifying metastasis-driving genes as potential targets for therapy (oncotargets). A differential gene expression profile of metastatic LTL-313H and non-metastatic LTL-313B prostate cancer tissue xenografts, derived from one patient's specimen, was subjected to integrative analysis using the Ingenuity Upstream Regulator Analysis tool. Six candidate master regulatory genes were identified, including GATA2, a gene encoding a pioneer factor, a special transcription factor facilitating the recruitment of additional transcription factors. Elevated GATA2 expression in metastatic prostate cancer tissues correlated with poor patient prognosis. Furthermore, GATA2 gene silencing in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells led to a marked reduction in cell migration, tissue invasion, focal adhesion disassembly and to a dramatic change in cell transcriptomes, indicating that GATA2 plays a critical role in prostate cancer metastasis. As such, GATA2 could represent a prostate cancer metastasis-driving gene and a potential target for therapy of metastatic prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The primary indication for prostate MR and MR spectroscopic imaging is evaluating men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer who are deciding whether to undergo surgery or radiotherapy. Other applications of MR and MR spectroscopic imaging in prostate cancer are not defined fully. Areas of research include volumetric localization of prostate cancer, in vivo MR spectroscopic imaging at high field strength, in vitro MR spectroscopic imaging at very high field strength, novel spectroscopic markers of malignancy,and interventional MR guidance of biopsy and therapy. MR spectroscopic imaging remains a relatively novel technique, and successful implementation is demanding. Nonetheless, only MR and MR spectroscopic imaging allow structural and metabolic evaluation of prostate cancer location, aggressiveness, and stage, and MR imaging provides clinically and therapeutically relevant information on prostatic and periprostatic anatomy.",prostate cancer
"Objective: To obtain an update of the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Data source: Review of all published literature on advanced prostate cancer was carried out through medline and index medicus search. Data selection: Published data on advanced prostate cancer from June 2005 to June 2007 was included in the review. Data extraction: Abstracts of articles identified were assessed, read and analysed to determine relevance to the title under review. Data synthesis: After establishing relevance from the abstract, the entire paper was read, and significant points included in the review. Conclusion: The mainstay of treatment of advanced prostate cancer remains hormone withdrawal. The introduction of docetaxel based chemotherapy has caused a paradigm shift.",prostate cancer
"Early detection of prostate cancer has produced distinct stage migration of prostate cancer to earlier, more curable disease through optimized combined use of digital rectal exam (DRE), transrectal ultrasound, and prostate specific antigen (PSA). Currently available and emerging data can be assessed according to the World Health Organization's established criteria. As a significant public health problem, prostate cancer meets almost all the criteria for screening. While concerns about incomplete natural history, progression rates, and the need for better prognostic factors are valid, important social and public health issues also need to be considered. If future expenditures for terminal cancer care are minimized via reductions in therapy choices or coverage, no economic benefit for prostate cancer screening should exist. Narrow-focused attempts at cost reduction could inappropriately discourage high risk groups from participating in early detection programs, thereby eliminating the greatest potential benefit. Conversely, the greatest immediate cost-control issue for prostate cancer care in the United States could be the marked increased detection in men older than 75 years of age. Current cost savings are possible with improved public health education about the appropriateness of early detection in the oldest age groups or those with significant preexisting medical conditions. Prostate cancer control perhaps requires a tailored approach of screening in high risk groups and more appropriate ""case finding"" in the lower risk, general population. The initial combination of PSA and DRE can result in early detection, which is both ethical and economic, for individual patients consulting with informed physicians.",prostate cancer
"The purpose of this review is to examine the implications of recent trends in prostate cancer incidence and mortality and to consider recent progress of epidemiological research on this disease. The incidence and mortality rates for prostate cancer are changing throughout the world at an accelerating pace. Much of the increase in incidence is related to changes in detection technology, but increases in mortality rates suggest other factors are involved. Recent research has focused on race-related difference, diet and related lifestyle exposures, the aetiologic significance of vasectomy and, patterns of familial aggregation. Continued monitoring of trends in incidence and mortality will be important as prostate cancer becomes a greater public health burden worldwide. Epidemiological research has identified several possible risk factors which may be useful for prostate cancer prevention and targeting high-risk individuals for early detection intervention. Additional research may confirm and refine understanding of prostate cancer aetiology.",prostate cancer
"Over the past decade, interest has been growing in the quality of life of men with prostate cancer. Traditionally considered a group with few psychological complications, 10% to 20% of men with prostate cancer are found to have clinically significant levels of psychological distress. This article reviews the prevalence of psychiatric symptomatology among prostate cancer patients, the psychological challenges of coping with the disease, and general guidelines for treatment.",prostate cancer
"The dramatic increase during the past decade in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and prostate biopsies has resulted in the detection of large numbers of small lesions, an increase in the incidence of prostate cancer, and an increasing incidence-to-mortality ratio. Currently, the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is increasingly greater than the risk of dying of it. The currently available treatments for prostate cancer are not well suited to treating small or indolent tumors. Radical treatment, whether surgery or radiotherapy, can eradicate cancer effectively, but these techniques, as well as hormonal manipulations, can have adverse effects on patients' health and quality of life. Watchful waiting, or ""active surveillance,"" has the advantage of avoiding the deleterious effects on quality of life, but it confronts patients with the emotional burden of living with an untreated cancer that could progress and metastasize. For active surveillance, no established, objective criteria are available for progression that would signal the optimal time for therapeutic intervention. PSA levels in patients with low-risk, small-volume cancers are more indicative of the size of the benign prostate or the presence of inflammation than of changes in the volume or growth of the cancer, and PSA levels inherently fluctuate, creating a low signal-to-noise ratio until the cancer is very large. Little risk exists in waiting to confirm a sustained increase in the PSA level before proceeding with a diagnostic biopsy. This policy would decrease the number of unnecessary biopsies, but still diagnose men within a safe timeframe. In studies controlled for age and comorbidity, the survival rate for patients with low-risk prostate cancer mirrors that expected in the general population. This holds true across cohorts of patients, whatever the treatment used. Because no strong medical or scientific evidence supports any particular ablative technique for low-risk prostate cancer, no standard of care has been universally accepted. Therefore, practice patterns are heterogeneous and depend more on the availability of treatments than on the features of the disease itself.",prostate cancer
"Background: A variety of innovative approaches to the prevention of prostate cancer are now available, including selenium, alpha tocopherol, dietary interventions, and vitamin D. Perhaps the most promising opportunity is based upon considerable evidence that cumulative androgen exposure of the prostate contributes to the age-related risk of prostate cancer. Methods: The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial has completed randomization of over 18,000 healthy men to either finasteride or placebo. Conclusions: While the primary objective of this study is to determine whether finasteride can reduce the period prevalence of prostate cancer over a 7-year period, the biologic and data resources of this study will provide multiple opportunities to better understand this most common cancer in U.S. men.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the second most common malignancy in American males and the third leading cause of cancer deaths in this population. There are no symptoms that are unique to early prostate cancer, and nearly one-half of patients will have metastatic disease at diagnosis. Because of its tremendous impact upon the health and well-being of the American male population, and the importance of early diagnosis in curability, there is keen interest in the development of effective screening procedures that are highly sensitive, specific, and cost-effective. Rectal examination serves as the historical control. The serum tumor markers of prostate cancer, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), are sensitive but relatively nonspecific in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The use of transrectal ultrasound as a screening tool is highly controversial but suffers from a similar lack of specificity. As yet, no diagnostic tests, alone or in combination, have proven to be of practical value in screening for prostate cancer. Fundamental but unanswered questions about the natural history and the high incidence of ""latent"" disease also obscure the issue of early diagnosis of prostate cancer and its impact on survival.",prostate cancer
"Introduction: According to recent reports from randomized studies comparing radical treatment or watchful waiting, the outcome of localized prostate cancer remains uncertain at individual level. It is especially true for the low-risk group (according D'Amico or CAPRA classifications), regarding the individual exposition to overtreatment by radical therapies or the opposite risk of under-treatment with active surveillance. Material and methods: In this review, we describe the available molecular predictor tests and functional MRI, as well as their potential role in the selection of the appropriate treatment for prostate cancer patients. Conclusion: The recent development of functional MRI imaging and clinical practice approval of molecular predictor tests for the assessment of the aggressive prostate cancer have brought new perspectives for the management of localized prostate cancer by active surveillance, focal ablative therapy or radical therapies.",prostate cancer
"Introduction: This study aimed to investigate the effect of low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) on prognosis, as the association of initial PSA level with prognosis in patients with metastatic castration-naive prostate cancer (mCNPC) remains unclear. Patients and methods: We evaluated 575 patients with mCNPC from 10 hospitals. Patients were stratified into 2 groups according to their initial PSA: PSA < 100 and PSA ≥ 100 groups. We compared castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-free survival, overall survival (OS), and OS from the CRPC diagnosis between the groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of initial PSA level on prognosis. Results: Of the 575 patients, 196 (34%) patients belonged to the PSA < 100 group. No significant difference was found in patients' backgrounds except for PSA, the extent of disease, and high tumor burden between the groups. CRPC-free survival was significantly shorter in the PSA ≥ 100 group than in the PSA < 100 group. However, the OS after CRPC diagnosis was significantly shorter in the PSA < 100 group than that of the PSA ≥ 100 group. Multivariate analyses showed that PSA < 100 ng/mL was an independent factor for OS after CRPC, whereas no significant association was observed in the CRPC-free survival and OS. Conclusions: A significant effect of initial PSA < 100 ng/mL on OS after CRPC was observed. PSA < 100 ng/mL might be a poor prognostic factor in patients with mCNPC after CRPC.",prostate cancer
"The epidemiology, histopathology, diagnosis and staging, and treatment of prostate cancer are reviewed. Prostate cancer, one of the most common malignancies occurring in men over age 50, will strike an estimated 103,000 men in the United States in 1989. More than 95% of prostatic tumors are adenocarcinomas. Tumors are graded on the basis of their degree of differentiation. Most afflicted men initially complain of difficulty in starting the urinary stream and of urinary bleeding, dribbling, and retention. Urinary obstruction may be present in advanced disease, and anemia, anorexia, and bone pain are common in metastatic disease. Prostatectomy and irradiation are used to treat disease localized to the prostate; the prognosis for such patients is good. Survival is diminished in cases of locally advanced and metastatic disease. Symptomatic metastatic disease is treated by hormonal manipulation through orchiectomy and administration of exogenous estrogens (diethylstilbestrol), luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs (leuprolide and goserelin), and antiandrogens (cyproterone acetate, flutamide, and others). Some 70-80% of patients respond to hormonal therapy for periods of up to three years. After relapse occurs, salvage hormonal therapies (aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole) may be attempted to prolong survival. Fluorouracil, doxorubicin, mitomycin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and estramustine have also been administered, with mixed results. Once relapse occurs in prostate cancer patients after initial hormonal therapy, the response to salvage hormonal or cytotoxic therapy is minimal; in the future, total androgen blockade and methods of decreasing drug resistance may be used to prolong survival.",prostate cancer
"Surgery, and radiation therapy remain the standard treatments for newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. Nonetheless, these aggressive treatments are associated with decreased quality of life with altered sexual and urinary functions. Using modern risk stratification, several centers have gained significant experience in identifying patients with a low risk of prostate cancer progression and have adopted an active surveillance program with delayed, selective, or curative therapy. Interestingly, only limited numbers of patients under active surveillance require additional treatment. Recent data suggest that delayed treatment does not appear to alter the clinical outcome among those highly selected patients. A better understanding of the molecular determinants of prostate cancer behavior would not only enable healthcare professionals to identify which cases need aggressive treatment but, perhaps more importantly, would also indicate potential targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",prostate cancer
"Background: The optimal hormone treatment strategy in prostate cancer is uncertain, particularly in patients with metastatic disease. We aimed to compare the relative benefits and harms of intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) to continuous androgen deprivation (CAD) in all stages of prostate cancer. Methods: We included eight randomised control trials (4668 patients) in our systematic review and meta-analysis. Median follow-up ranged from 29 to 118 months. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival, time to cancer progression and mortality unrelated to prostate cancer. The relative effect of treatment in patients with metastatic and those with non-metastatic disease was compared using pre-planned subgroup analysis. Results: There was no difference in OS between patients treated with IAD and CAD (HR 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.10); nor was there any difference in cancer-specific survival (HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.88-1.21). There was a non-significant trend towards longer time to prostate cancer progression for IAD (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84-1.04), raising the possibility of slower selection for castrate resistance. There was no significant difference in OS when analysis was restricted to patients with metastatic disease (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.91-1.19) or patients without metastatic disease (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91-1.23) (test for subgroup differences P=0.84). Most studies found an improvement in quality of life or toxicity profile with IAD. Conclusions: IAD is non-inferior to CAD in terms of OS and cancer-specific survival, and is at least non-inferior in terms of time to progression. This meta-analysis confirms IAD as a valid standard of care for managing prostate cancer patients.",prostate cancer
"The role of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis in the progression of prostate cancer is a cornerstone to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms causing castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Resistance of advanced prostate cancer to available treatment options makes it a clinical challenge that results in approximately 30,000 deaths of American men every year. Since the historic discovery by Dr. Huggins more than 70 years ago, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the principal treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Initially, ADT induces apoptosis of androgen-dependent prostate cancer epithelial cells and regression of androgen-dependent tumors. However, the majority of patients with advanced prostate cancer progress and become refractory to ADT due to emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells driven by aberrant AR activation. Microtubule-targeting agents such as taxanes, docetaxel and paclitaxel, have enjoyed success in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer; although new, recently designed mitosis-specific agents, such as the polo-kinase and kinesin-inhibitors, have yielded clinically disappointing results. Docetaxel, as a first-line chemotherapy, improves prostate cancer patient survival by months, but tumor resistance to these therapeutic agents inevitably develops. On a molecular level, progression to CRPC is characterized by aberrant AR expression, de novo intraprostatic androgen production, and cross talk with other oncogenic pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that reactivation of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) processes may facilitate the development of not only prostate cancer but also prostate cancer metastases. EMT is characterized by gain of mesenchymal characteristics and invasiveness accompanied by loss of cell polarity, with an increasing number of studies focusing on the direct involvement of androgen-AR signaling axis in EMT, tumor progression, and therapeutic resistance. In this article, we discuss the current knowledge of mechanisms via which the AR signaling drives therapeutic resistance in prostate cancer metastatic progression and the novel therapeutic interventions targeting AR in CRPC.",prostate cancer
"Although the incidence of latent or incidental cancer of the prostate is quite similar among Japanese and Americans, the incidence of clinically manifest prostate cancer and the mortality rates of prostate cancer are significantly higher in the latter. But, recently, the incidence of clinical cancer in Japan has been increasing exponentially, and the change in dietary habits is considered to be a major cause of this increase. Comparing the histological differences of prostate cancer between the Japanese and the Americans, the cribriform pattern is predominant in Japanese clinically significant cancer. On the other hand, a simple glandular pattern is predominant in American clinically significant cancer. These differences between Japanese and American prostate cancer suggest that each prostate cancer arises from different sources. For the organ-confined prostate cancer (stage A2 and B); radical prostatectomy has been considered the definitive treatment. But radiotherapy is now considered another radical treatment for localized prostate cancer which results in reduced morbidity. A heavy particle beam and brachytherapy are an even more radical modality that can deliver a greater dose of radiation to a localized lesion without affecting the surrounding normal tissue. For locally advanced prostate cancer (stage C); For the purpose of downstaging and radical treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer, combination of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy and radical prostatectomy has been expected. This regimen resulted in a significant decrease of positive surgical margins, but did not result in decrease of PSA failure. The impact on patient survival will be determined by the long-term follow-up. For advanced prostate cancer (stage D); In the study of the comparison of bilateral orchiectomy with or without flutamide in stage D2 prostate cancer, neither significant improvement of combination group on progression-free survival nor overall survival has been shown. From this result, the true efficacy of MAB is not certain.",prostate cancer
"Background: Men with prostate cancer will not die of the disease until it progresses to the metastatic castration resistant stage. At that stage, the median survival is 9 to 30 months. Methods: Recently approved and emerging treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were reviewed based on their mechanisms of action, as well as sequencing and combining these treatments with existing options. Results: Advances in androgen deprivation therapy, immunotherapy, bone-targeted therapy, and chemotherapy have led to approvals of abiraterone acetate, sipuleucel-T, denosumab, and cabazitaxel for the treatment of mCRPC. Despite improvements in patient survival and quality of life, mCRPC remains incurable. Conclusions: With the emerging new therapies, this is an unprecedented time in treating mCRPC. A better understanding of their mechanisms of action, the genetic makeup of each mCRPC, and the development of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers will help determine sequencing or different combination treatments for each individual patient.",prostate cancer
"The standard treatments of localized prostate cancer include surgical resection and/or radiotherapy. Recently in 2016, Zhao et al. described a tool to predict which patients will most likely gain from postoperative radiotherapy. Such a method can personalize treatment plan by maximizing benefit but minimizing harm.",prostate cancer
"Liver metastasis from prostate cancer is uncommon and remains poorly understood. We computer searched the clinical records of all our patients registered into a database to identify patients that presented or developed liver metastases. A total of 27 prostate cancer patients with ultrasound or CT/MR imaging evidence of liver metastases were included in our analysis. The liver metastasis rate from metastatic prostate cancer was 4.29%. Eight (29.63%) patients had previously untreated, hormone-naive prostate cancer (synchronous liver metastases at diagnosis of prostate cancer), whereas 19 (70.37%) patients had already been diagnosed as having hormone-refractory prostate cancer. In the hormone-naive group, the median overall survival after liver metastases diagnosis was 38 months and half of the patients were still alive at the latest follow-up, whereas only 6 months in the hormone-refractory group (p = 0.003). High concentration of serum neuron-specific enolase and previous chemotherapy were associated with a significantly poor overall survival after liver metastases in the hormone-refractory group using Kaplan–Meier curves and logrank tests for univariate analysis.",prostate cancer
"Basic, epidemiological and clinical issues to be solved on prostate cancer were discussed as a preface. Sharp increase of prostate cancer incidence in Asian countries, almost constant level of latent cancer are intriguing epidemiological and pathological issues. Treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer, hormone-refractory prostate cancer has been a long-standing clinical challenge. New radiotherapy is expected for further advancement. Heterogeneity, clonility, multiplicity of prostate cancer are interesting pathological challenges.",prostate cancer
"Although most patients with prostate cancer respond to initial androgen-deprivation therapy, progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is almost inevitable. In 2004, the docetaxel/prednisone regimen was approved for the management of patients with metastatic CRPC, becoming the standard first-line therapy. Recent advances have also led to an unprecedented number of approved new drugs; thus, providing several treatment options for patients with metastatic CRPC. Five new drugs have received US Food and Drug Administration-approval between 2010 and 2012: sipuleucel-T, an immunotherapeutic agent; cabazitaxel, a novel microtubule inhibitor; abiraterone acetate, a new androgen biosynthesis inhibitor; enzalutamide, a novel androgen receptor inhibitor; and denosumab, a bone-targeting agent. Such drugs are either already marketed or about to be marketed in the Middle East. Data supporting the approval of each of these agents are described in this review, as are recent approaches to the treatment of metastatic CRPC.",prostate cancer
"The progression of human prostate cancer from histomorphologic to clinical expression often requires several decades. This study emphasizes the importance of developing relevant human prostate cancer models to study the molecular events leading to prostate cancer progression. These models will provide a rational basis for chemopreventive and treatment strategies to retard the progression of human prostate cancer from its localized to its metastatic state. In our laboratory, we have established the LNCaP progression and ARCaP models and the in vitro three-dimensional growth models involving prostate cancer and bone stroma to study the progression of prostate cancer. We propose that prostate cancer may progress from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent state. While existing as androgen-independent tumors (defined as tumors capable of growing in castrated hosts and secreting PSA in serum), prostate cancer may assume three different phenotypes as it progresses: androgen-independent while remaining androgen-responsive; androgen-independent and unresponsive to androgen stimulation; and androgen-independent but suppressed by androgen. It is conceivable that any androgen-independent human prostate cancer may contain variable proportions of cells that exhibit these three phenotypes. This concept may have important implications in determining strategies for chemopreventive and therapeutic trials. We have established three-dimensional growth models of prostate cancer cells either in collagen gel or microgravity-simulated growth conditions to form viable and functional organoids which contain prostate cancer epithelial cells admixed with prostate or bone stromal cells. These in vitro models combined with the in vivo models described above will enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of prostate cancer growth and progression, and hence could improve efficiency in screening chemopreventive and therapeutic agents which alter the biologic behaviors of human prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"An increased interest in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, particularly in the last few years, is reflected in the literature. Numerous articles have been published since 1980 on the subject of imaging of the prostate gland. This article is a review of transrectal ultrasound and its efficacy in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Included is a review of the normal prostate anatomy, typical and atypical sonographic features, clinical and radiographic staging of prostate cancer, efficacy of the digital rectal examination, role of ultrasound in prostate cancer screening, surgical treatment, and radiotherapy of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The discovery of prostate cancer biomarkers has been boosted by the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Nevertheless, many challenges still exist in exploiting the flood of sequence data and translating them into routine diagnostics and prognosis of prostate cancer. Here we review the recent developments in prostate cancer biomarkers by high throughput sequencing technologies. We highlight some fundamental issues of translational bioinformatics and the potential use of cloud computing in NGS data processing for the improvement of prostate cancer treatment.",prostate cancer
"The authors present a flyover of current management of prostate cancer. The topics include active surveillance, surgery, radiotherapy, high-intensity focalized ultrasound (HIFU). Current hormone treatment modalities as well as chemotherapy for hormone-resistant prostate cancer (HRPC) management are also reported. Reasonable evidence has supported the safety and feasibility, during a period of 5-10 years, of an active surveillance regimen for men with low-risk prostate cancer. Radical prostatectomy is an effective form of therapy for patients with clinically significant prostate cancer. Outcomes are highly sensitive to variations in surgical technique. The risks of perioperative complications such as urinary and sexual dysfunction appear to be as great with robotic-assisted prostatectomy as with any other technique. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is an effective noninvasive form of curative therapy with a long-term risk of troublesome bowel and sexual and urinary dysfunction. EBRT can also be used in adjuvant manner or in combination. Brachytherapy, is a convenient effective form of radiotherapy targeted for selected patients with clinically confined cancer without evidence of extraprostatic extension on imaging. Excellent outcomes require meticulous technique. Acute urinary symptoms are frequent; and the long-term risks of proctitis and erectile dysfunction seem comparable to the risks associated with external beam radiotherapy. HIFU has been used widely in Europe for complete ablation of the prostate, especially in the elderly who are unwilling or unable to undergo more invasive radical therapy. For low- or intermediate-risk cancer, the short- and intermediate-term oncologic results have been acceptable but need confirmation in prospective multicenter trials presently underway. HIFU is associated with a risk of acute urinary symptoms requiring transurethral resection before or after HIFU. Erectile function has not been adequately documented after HIFU. HIFU holds promise for focal ablation of prostate cancer and in case of recurrence after EBRT. Androgen-deprivation therapy is not recommended for men with localized prostate cancer. For locally extensive cancer, androgen-deprivation therapy should be used alone only for the relief of local symptoms in men with a life expectancy of < 5 years who are not eligible for more aggressive treatment. Management of HRPC is actually accepted with docetaxel chemotherapy based regimens.",prostate cancer
"Introduction: One fifth of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard systemic therapy in these patients. Despite initial response, essentially all patients will develop castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this review, we will discuss the revised definitions of CRPC and the latest understanding of the biology of the androgen/androgen receptor axis in the development of advanced prostate cancer. Materials and methods: A systematic literature review was conducted via electronic database articles based on title, abstract, study format, and content. The majority of selected articles were published between 1992 and 2013. Older studies were included selectively if historically relevant. Results: Prostate cancer becomes castration resistant through numerous pathways, including androgen and androgen receptor (AR) dependent mechanisms as well as ligand and AR independent pathways. Therefore the terms androgen-insensitive and hormone-refractory should be avoided and replaced by the term castration resistant. Recent advances in understanding molecular mechanisms of castration resistance have led to development of novel CRPC therapeutics. Conclusions: CRPC remains an incurable disease. Further understanding of the pathways involved in castration resistance will set the basis for development of therapies to increase survival in these patients.",prostate cancer
"Introduction: The Prouts Neck Meetings on Prostate Cancer began in 1985 through the efforts of the Organ Systems Branch of the National Cancer Institute to stimulate new research and focused around specific questions in prostate tumorigenesis and therapy. Methods: These meetings were think tanks, composed of around 75 individuals, and divided equally between young investigators and senior investigators. Over the years, many new concepts related to prostate cancer resulted from these meetings and the prostate cancer community has sorely missed them since the last one in 2007. Results: We report here the first of a new series of meetings. The 2013 meeting focused on defining how the field of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer needs to evolve to impact survival and was entitled: ""Beyond AR: New Approaches to Treating Metastatic Prostate Cancer."" As castrate resistant prostate cancers escape second generation anti-androgen agents, three phenotypes/genotypes of CRPC appear to be increasing in prevalence and remain resistant to treatment: NeuroEndocrine Prostate Cancer, Persistent AR-Dependent Prostate Cancer, and Androgen Receptor Pathway Independent Prostate Cancer. Discussion: It is clear that new treatment paradigms need to be developed for this diverse group of diseases. The Prouts Neck 2013 Meeting on Prostate Cancer helped to frame the current state of the field and jumpstart ideas for new avenues of treatment.",prostate cancer
"Patients with prostate carcinoma paradoxically have both a hypercoagulable state and a bleeding diathesis. Hypercoagulability manifested by venous and arterial thrombosis has been documented in several large clinical trials. However, many investigators have reported a high risk of postoperative bleeding in prostate cancer patients. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy has also been commonly noted at different clinical stages of this indolent cancer. In this article we review clinical, laboratory, and experimental evidence for abnormalities of various components of the coagulation and plasminogen pathways and analyze their contribution in prostate cancer growth, progression, and angiogenesis. Finally, we propose potential therapeutic antiangiogenic strategies in patients with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Surgery or radiation therapy remain the standard curative treatments for newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. Nonetheless, these aggressive treatments are associated with decreased quality of life with altered sexual and urinary functions. The objective was a systematic review of active surveillance protocols to investigate the role of histopathology and molecular markers in the active surveillance of prostate cancer. Medline was searched using the following terms: prostate cancer, active surveillance and expectant management. Selection criteria, follow-up strategies and outcomes. Using modern risk stratification, several centres have gained significant experience in identifying patients with a low risk of prostate cancer progression and have adopted an active surveillance program with delayed curative therapy. Interestingly, only limited numbers of patients under active surveillance require additional treatment. Recent data suggest that delayed treatment does not appear to alter the clinical outcome among those highly selected patients. The future and conclusions. A better understanding of the molecular determinants of prostate cancer behaviour would not only enable healthcare professionals to identify which cases need aggressive treatment but, perhaps more importantly, would also indicate potential targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",prostate cancer
"Between 1951 and 1966, more than twelve hundred homeless, alcoholic men from New York's skid row were subjected to invasive medical procedures, including open perineal biopsy of the prostate gland. If positive for cancer, men typically underwent prostatectomy, surgical castration, and estrogen treatments. The Bowery series was meant to answer important questions about prostate cancer's diagnosis, natural history, prevention, and treatment. While the Bowery series had little ultimate impact on practice, in part due to ethical problems, its means and goals were prescient. In the ensuing decades, technological tinkering catalyzed the transformation of prostate cancer attitudes and interventions in directions that the Bowery series' promoters had anticipated. These largely forgotten set of practices are a window into how we have come to believe that the screen and radical treatment paradigm in prostate cancer is efficacious and the underlying logic of the twentieth-century American quest to control cancer and our fears of cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. New advances in screening and imaging allow earlier diagnosis, and improved surgical techniques have reduced sexual dysfunction and incontinence that often resulted from radical prostatectomy. However, many questions remain. How can prostate cancer best be detected in an early curable form? What is the role of tumor markers? Who should be screened and how? What prognostic tools can help with decisions about appropriate therapy?",prostate cancer
"Human prostatic carcinogenesis is characterized by the accumulation of both genetic and epigenetic alterations. The epigenetic changes appear earlier and more consistently, and because the DNA sequence remains intact, may be therapeutically reversible. The mechanism(s) by which epigenetic changes appear during the pathogenesis of prostate cancer have not been established. Nonetheless, new methods for the detection of abnormal DNA methylation, a molecular biomarker of epigenetic alterations, are poised to provide clinical tests potentially useful for prostate cancer detection and diagnosis. In addition, new drugs targeting DNA methyltransferases and other enzymes involved in the maintenance of chromatic structure have been introduced into clinical trials for the treatment of advanced prostate cancers. If sufficiently safe strategies for chromatin modulation can be discovered and developed, epigenetic alterations may become rational targets for both prostate cancer prevention and prostate cancer treatment.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: Hereditary prostate cancer accounts for 5% to 10% of all prostate cancer cases. We assessed clinical characteristics and survival in patients with hereditary prostate cancer Materials and methods: The study comprised 201 patients from 62 Swedish hereditary prostate cancer families and 402 controls with prostate cancer who were matched for age and calendar year at diagnosis, and the hospital where the diagnosis was made. Clinical data were obtained from the National Cancer Registry, Causes of Death Registry and medical records. Results: Median age at the diagnosis of hereditary prostate cancer was 68 years, which was 6 years less than in patients with prostate cancer in the general population in Sweden. Distributions of tumor grade, symptoms at diagnosis and initial therapy were similar in hereditary prostate cancer cases and controls. More controls were classified with localized disease but it may have been due to methodological problems. Overall and cancer specific survival was similar in patients with hereditary prostate cancer and controls as well as in subgroup analyses including those with early onset and those diagnosed before 1990. Prostate cancer was the cause of death in 75% of patients with hereditary prostate cancer, in contrast to 55% with prostate cancer in the Swedish population. This difference was completely explained by the earlier age at the diagnosis of hereditary prostate cancer. Conclusions: Hereditary prostate cancer has an earlier onset than sporadic prostate cancer but this study did not indicate any other important difference in clinical characteristics or survival in patients with hereditary prostate cancer and those with sporadic prostate cancer. However, it cannot be excluded that individual hereditary prostate cancer genes may have specific biological characteristics.",prostate cancer
"Previous attempts to link prostate cancer progression to genetic alterations have been unsuccessful, and consequently, there is still no reliable predictor of prognosis for men with this disease. A recent study by Taylor et al., published in Cancer Cell, assesses copy number alterations, mutations, and transcriptomes in 218 tumors and 12 prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts. Their analysis identifies frequencies of ERG alterations, 8p loss and 8q gain similar to previous findings. It also reveals novel genetic factors in prostate cancer progression, including the androgen receptor coactivator, NCOA2, which serves as an oncogene in about 11% of tumors, and a deletion at chromosome 3p14, which was associated with TMPRSS-ERG fusion. The copy number alteration data demonstrates six distinct subgroups of prostate cancer with considerable variation in time to biochemical relapse. Classification of prostate cancer into these genetic subgroups may help clinicians predict the likelihood of disease progression in newly diagnosed men, ultimately guiding treatment decisions and therapy development.",prostate cancer
"As screening for prostate cancer has become more common, the issues surrounding its diagnosis and treatment have grown more complex. This review surveys recent advances and controversies, including definition of risk factors, the role of screening, and current treatment strategies.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: Management of locally advanced prostate cancer remains controversial. Various single and combination modality approaches have been advocated, but an accepted standard of care remains undefined. The purpose of this review is to define the current knowledge in managing locally advanced prostate cancer and to propose new treatment approaches based on current knowledge. Materials and methods: A MEDLINE search to detect all relevant articles on the management of locally advanced prostate cancer was performed. A review of the staging, natural history, and prognosis of this disease was also performed. Results: The lack of a clearly defined treatment approach to patients with locally advanced prostate cancer stems from multiple factors, including ambiguities in clinical staging, inadequate knowledge of the natural history of the cancer, and a dearth of comparative randomized trials evaluating efficacy of different therapies. Single modality treatment, including radical prostatectomy (RP) or external-beam radiotherapy alone, is associated with high rates of failure. The use of adjuvant hormonal ablation therapy in combination with external-beam radiotherapy has shown improvement in progression-free and overall survival, although similar improvements have not been clearly demonstrated for surgical patients treated with hormonal therapy. New advances in chemotherapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer suggest that response rates may be as high as 50% or more, and current trials are evaluating the addition of chemotherapy to hormonal ablation in either surgery or radiation therapy in locally advanced prostate cancer. Conclusion: Optimal management of locally advanced prostate cancer remains undefined. Standard treatment options include RP, external-beam radiotherapy, or hormonal ablation therapy, alone or in combination. New approaches being tested include improved methods for delivering radiation or combining hormonal ablation with surgery or radiation. It is possible that other forms of systemic therapy, including chemotherapy, may become important components of multimodality treatment. Clinical trials designed to test this hypothesis are ongoing.",prostate cancer
"Stage A1 prostate cancer implies indolence. If only well-differentiated low-volume tumors are considered, the rate of cancer growth, clinical progression, and prostate cancer death is exceedingly low. All but a very few of these patients will need observation alone. Younger patients (those less than 60 years of age) and those with more moderately differentiated tumors or with serological or ultrasound evidence of residual cancer need further evaluation. It is likely that patients within this group are those who have in past studies experienced a higher degree of progression and cancer mortality. A stepped-up effort to detect nonpalpable prostate cancer has included PSA and transrectal ultrasound with random biopsies. Prostate cancer screening using a serum test and/or ultrasound has allowed increased detection of otherwise clinically silent cancer (stage A). Occult prostate cancer identified by needle biopsy or detected through elevated PSA levels most often is peripheral zone cancer and more aggressive than that arising in the transitional zone. A reclassification of stage A is therefore needed and a new scheme for TNM staging was recently introduced (Table 4). Because of its more aggressive potential, the new stage T1c will likely require different treatment recommendations than those for traditional stage A1 (T1a). More time and evaluation will be needed to estimate the prognosis of those diagnosed with minimal stage T1c prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) has a close relation with prostate cancer. It is involved not only in angiogenesis, cell proliferation/survival and glucose metabolism but also in p53, p21 and signal transduction pathway in prostate cancer. Further studies of HIF-1 may yield new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. We present a review of the structure and biological functions of HIF-1 and its relation with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among American men and is the third leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Over the past few years, significant advances (e.g. improved prostatic ultrasonography and the discovery of serum prostate-specific antigen) have made it possible to detect prostate cancer at an early stage. In addition, refinements in the treatment both of localized disease (by nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy) and of advanced disease (by novel forms of hormonal therapy) have improved the outlook and quality of life for men with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is often considered to be a premalignant lesion and the main precursor of invasive carcinoma of the prostate. We evaluated the evidence for and against PIN as a premalignant lesion and determined guidelines for the clinical management of PIN. Materials and methods: Literature analysis of histopathological, morphometric, phenotypic and molecular genetic evidence of progression and of clinical findings regarding PIN was done. Literature searches were performed on MEDLINE with relevant key words. Results: PIN, like prostate cancer, occurs most frequently in the peripheral zone of the prostate and is usually located in close proximity to prostate cancer. The relative PIN and prostate cancer volumes vary inversely. Prostate specific antigen in cases of PIN appears to be intermediate between prostate cancer and normal levels, although this elevation may be explained by concomitant prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy in PIN follows the aneuploid proportion as in the concomitant prostate cancer. Prostate cancer and PIN show evidence of loss of putative tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 8p. The clinical relevance of PIN biopsy findings is based on the association of neoplasia and prostate cancer. High grade PIN in core biopsies without concomitant prostate cancer has a substantial risk for prostate cancer in subsequent biopsies (24 to 73%, up to 100% when the digital rectal examination is suspicious) and should cause further biopsy sampling. Conclusions: There is convincing evidence that PIN is a precursor lesion to prostate cancer, with a close association of PIN and prostate cancer in biopsy and prostatectomy specimens. A biopsy finding of high grade PIN necessitates further investigation in patients who are candidates for radical treatment for localized prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"For about 50 years, androgen blockade in prostate cancer has been limited to monotherapy (surgical castration) or high doses of estrogens in patients with advanced disease and bone metastases. The discovery of medical castration with LHRH agonists has led to fundamental changes in the endocrine therapy of prostate cancer. In 1979, the first prostate cancer patient treated with an LHRH agonist received such treatment at the Laval University Medical Center. A long series of studies have clearly demonstrated that medical castration with an LHRH agonist has inhibitory effects on prostate cancer equivalent to those of surgical castration. The much higher acceptability of LHRH agonists has been essential to permit a series of studies in localized disease. Based upon the finding that the testicles and adrenals contribute approximately equal amounts of androgens in the human prostate, the combination of medical (LHRH agonist) or surgical castration associated with a pure antiandrogen (flutamide, nilutamide or bicalutamide) has led to the first demonstration of a prolongation of life in prostate cancer, namely a 10-20% decreased risk of death according to the various metaanalyses of all the studies performed in advanced disease. In analogy with the other types of advanced cancers, the success of combined androgen blockade in metastatic disease is limited by the development of resistance to treatment. To avoid the problem of resistance to treatment while taking advantage of the relative ease of diagnosis of prostate cancer at an ""early"" stage, the much higher acceptability of LHRH agonists has permitted a series of studies which have demonstrated a major reduction in deaths from prostate cancer ranging from 31% to 87% at 5 years of follow-up in patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. Most importantly, recent data show that the addition of a pure antiandrogen to an LHRH agonist in order to block the androgens made locally in the prostate leads to a 90% long-term control or probable cure of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the second most common malignancy among males after lung cancer. The growth of prostate cancer cells depends on the presence of androgens, a group of steroid hormones that include testosterone and its more active metabolite dihydrotestoste-rone. Most prostate cancers are androgen-dependent and respond to the antiandrogens or androgen-deprivation therapy. However, the progression to an androgen-independent stage occurs frequently. Possible mechanisms that could be involved in the development of hormone resistant prostate cancer causes including androgen receptor (AR) mutations, AR amplification/over expression, interaction between AR and other growth factors, and enhanced signaling in a ligand-independent manner are discussed.",prostate cancer
"The economic costs of early stage prostate cancer are significant, and will likely increase as the proportion of older men grows in the population of industrialised nations. In the US, total costs have been estimated to range from US dollars 1.72 billion to US dollars 4.75 billion annually (1990 costs). Costs related to early stage prostate cancer arise from screening, staging and treatment. Cost-effectiveness models of population-based prostate cancer screening indicate that such screening could result in as much as US dollars 27.9 billion (1988 values) in charges to the US healthcare system. Evidence-based cancer-staging strategies would result in significant reduction of wasted expense. Rational allocation of healthcare dollars for prostate cancer screening and treatment may ultimately depend on data from randomised controlled trials.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most prevalent non-cutaneous cancer in men worldwide. As a result of increased survival rates, men and their partners are living longer with the sexual sequelae of active treatments for prostate cancer, including surgery, radiotherapy and hormone therapy. The effect of erectile dysfunction on the patient and his partner is complex; many men experience psychosocial effects influenced by their hegemonic masculine beliefs. Some men experience difficulties in addressing their needs and require support while they attempt to reframe their beliefs about masculinity. The PLISSIT model can be used to guide healthcare practitioners in assessing and addressing the needs of this group of patients. The man's partner should be included in assessment and interventions where appropriate.",prostate cancer
"High-risk, localized prostate cancer represents a complex and diverse disease with many available treatment modalities. Patients are often deemed high risk because they are at increased risk for biochemical failure after primary intervention. However, these ""high-risk"" men may not be at significant risk of dying from their cancer. In this review, an attempt will be made to better define high-risk patients and help identify men at increased risk for mortality, not simply biochemical failure, after a diagnosis of localized prostate cancer. A review of available monotherapies as well as previously successful multimodality treatments will also be presented. Finally, this review will provide a glimpse into the future direction of high-risk prostate cancer multimodal therapy by providing a synopsis several current randomized clinical trials using effective systemic adjuvant therapies following local treatment.",prostate cancer
"No screening test has been proven to reduce prostate cancer mortality. DRE has been the traditional method of screening, and it is often used to detect other diseases in addition to prostate cancer. Newer modalities, such as TRUS and PSA, can identify patients with nonpalpable prostate cancer, but the use of these tests will also result in many false-positives. In addition, it is not known whether the use of these tests will reduce prostate cancer mortality, or instead cause harm to those patients screened. Given the potential for harm, and the extraordinary expense, routine screening of asymptomatic men with newer modalities should be considered experimental.",prostate cancer
"The popularity of radiotherapy as a minimally invasive treatment for prostate cancer is increasing. Despite advancements in radiation delivery, a number of patients will fail treatment. Salvage radical prostatectomy has been the main therapeutic option for locally recurrent radiation failure prostate cancer with curative intent. The operation is technically difficult to perform and associated with significant comorbidities. Salvage cryotherapy has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative option. In this article, we review the role of cryotherapy in recurrent prostate cancer and compare its outcome with salvage radical prostatectomy.",prostate cancer

"Objective: To morphometrically compare local atherosclerotic changes in cancerous prostate with those in noncancerous prostate specimens, as epidemiological studies report a positive association between the prevalence of general atherosclerosis and prostate cancer. Materials and methods: The intima-to-media-ratio (IMR) of 538 prostate capsular tissue arteries was measured in 50 prostate cancer-positive and 29 prostate cancer-negative specimens (including 26 with benign prostatic hyperplasia and three with normal prostatic tissue). Results: An IMR of >1 was significantly associated with prostate cancer and a greater risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio 2.28). The IMR was >1 in cancer-positive specimens about twice as often as in cancer-negative tissue. Conclusion: Local atherosclerosis (measured by the IMR) was more pronounced in prostate cancer-positive than in prostate cancer-negative specimens. The results support the view that men with local atherosclerotic lesions are at higher risk of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: This review highlights the most important developments in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of prostate cancer published in the medical literature over the past year. Recent findings: Recent research has revealed a relatively high rate of prostate specific antigen screening in elderly men regardless of comorbidity status. Other findings include data that finasteride may increase the sensitivity of prostate specific antigen to detect prostate cancer. In terms of use of androgen deprivation therapy as part of primary therapy, a randomized trial has demonstrated that immediate therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer improves overall survival. There is growing literature, however, confirming the risks associated with this treatment, including an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and diabetes. New randomized trial data of adjuvant radiotherapy for high-risk disease have not demonstrated a survival benefit over observation. For patients who experience disease relapse following local therapy, definitions of biochemical failure following prostatectomy and radiation therapy are proposed. In more advanced disease, immunotherapy has preliminarily demonstrated survival benefit in a randomized trial. Summary: Data reported over the last year have significant implications for those involved in the management of prostate cancer, ranging from primary care physicians to medical oncologists, urologists, and radiation oncologists.",prostate cancer
"The androgen receptor plays a pivotal role in the prostate. Its primary function is to provide responsive gene products for differentiation and growth, but under abnormal conditions it contributes to the development of prostate cancer. The goal of this review is to elucidate the molecular functions of the androgen receptor and its role in prostate cancer. Initially the function of the androgen receptor will be described. Next, the clinical diagnosis, epidemiological impact, and treatments of androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer will be discussed. Finally we will examine how the mechanism of androgen action has played a role in the translation of new therapies and how this may influence future treatment modalities of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer remains a significant health concern for men throughout the world. Recently, there has developed an expanding multidisciplinary body of literature suggesting a link between chronic inflammation and prostate cancer. In support of this hypothesis, population studies have found an increased relative risk of prostate cancer in men with a prior history of certain sexually transmitted infections or prostatitis. Furthermore, genetic epidemiological data have implicated germline variants of several genes associated with the immunological aspects of inflammation in modulating prostate cancer risk. The molecular pathogenesis of prostate cancer has been characterized by somatic alterations of genes involved in defenses against inflammatory damage and in tissue recovery. A novel putative prostate cancer precursor lesion, proliferative inflammatory atrophy, which shares some molecular traits with prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer, has been characterized. Here, we review the evidence associating chronic inflammation and prostate cancer and consider a number of animal models of prostate inflammation that should allow the elucidation of the mechanisms by which prostatic inflammation could lead to the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. These emerging insights into chronic inflammation in the etiology of prostate carcinogenesis hold the promise of spawning new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for men with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Transrectal ultrasonography is a new procedure for detecting prostate cancer. Better imaging of the prostate results in a better understanding of the appearance of prostate cancer and a heightened awareness of cancer location within the prostate. The appearance of malignancy frequently is a hypoechoic lesion, most often in the peripheral zone of the prostate. Biopsy of suspected areas of the prostate is also more accurate when done in conjunction with transrectal ultrasonography, which also allows evaluation of lesions not yet palpable on rectal examination. This has introduced the concepts of early detection and mass screening for prostate cancer. Although controversial and limited by low specificity, transrectal ultrasonography is a valuable addition for better detection of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Despite the clinical importance of prostate cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of prostate cancer are poorly understood. The lack of knowledge on the mechanisms has probably been one of the most important reasons why no new treatment modalities have been developed to cure the disease. Recent studies, especially those performed by comparative genomic hybridization, have revealed the frequent chromosomal alterations that most likely harbor the genes critical for the progression of prostate cancer. Such genetic aberrations include losses of 8p, 10q, 16q, and 13q as well as gains of 7p, 7q, 8q, and Xq. Unfortunately, the target genes for these alterations are, in most of the cases, not known. We have recently identified the androgen receptor (AR) gene as a target gene for the Xq12 amplification found in one-third of the hormone-refractory prostate cancer. The findings suggest that the AR gene amplification and overexpression is involved in the emergence of hormone-refractory prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate carcinoma is a growing concern in our aging society. While the disease often follows a indolent course, it is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males. Prostate cancer screening is promising but remains unproven and controversial. The therapy of prostate cancer has changed little over the past 10 years. The tumor remains refractory to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. True containment of this disease will require novel strategies of diagnosis, biologic assessment, and therapy.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is currently the most common solid organ cancer type among men in the Western world. Currently, all decision-making algorithms and nomograms rely on demographics, clinicopathological data and symptoms.

In this review, novel functional and molecular imaging techniques used in the diagnosis and staging of localised prostate cancer and their effect on treatment decisions are discussed.",prostate cancer
"Co-operation and communication between clinicians and scientists is required to meet the major challenges presented by the diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer. Molecular oncology is playing an increasing role in this field and has already been instrumental in elucidating many of the basic mechanisms underlying the development and progression of prostate cancer. By understanding these mechanisms, factors which determine whether the tumour will metastasise, such as loss of function of E-cadherin, have been identified and may help the clinician determine which therapeutic strategy is most appropriate for an individual patient. Clinicians also need more sensitive tools to help them diagnose prostate cancer and monitor its progression. The marker DD3/PCA3 shows potential in this respect. Perhaps the most fruitful area for molecular research is in the definition of new therapeutic targets useful in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. In the early stages of development are those agents which target the activation of programmed cell death, inhibition of signal transduction, inactivation of telomerase activity, and differentiation therapy. In order to accelerate the implementation of diagnostic aids and more effective therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer, clinicians must have a greater insight into the molecular mechanisms operating in their patients' disease and scientists need to understand the clinical problems involved.",prostate cancer
Purpose: We investigate the long-term outcome of patients with prostate cancer treated with noncurative intent. Materials and methods: All 514 prostate cancer patients who died between 1988 and 1991 and who underwent either deferred or immediate hormonal treatment were followed from death until diagnosis. Results: In all patients with stage M0 disease at diagnosis the ultimate cancer mortality rate was 50%. Among the 65 patients who survived at least 10 years the mortality rate due to prostate cancer was 63%. Conclusions: Mortality in patients with stage M0 prostate cancer was surprisingly high when followup exceeded 10 years.,prostate cancer
"Background: A number of options are available to treat localised prostate cancer, with different side effect profiles, effect on quality of life and social costs. Objective: This article outlines the grading and staging of localised prostate cancer and explores the role of each of the treatment options currently available. Discussion: Treatment selection in localised prostate cancer depends on life expectancy and comorbidities, risk adapted assessment and patient preference. Risk assessment depends on the grade, stage and prostate specific antigen. Options for treatment of localised prostate cancer include active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, curative external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy. Androgen deprivation therapy in combination with radiation therapy has been shown to increase survival in men with high and high/intermediate risk of occult metastases. Survival rates are essentially equivalent for each modality and are over 90% at 10 years and over 75% at 15 years.",prostate cancer
"The dramatic increase in the number of patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in the last decade presents a difficult challenge for physicians. Because the window of opportunity for cure is short it is vital to begin treatment before the cancer cells invade neighbouring tissues and organs or metastasise to other sites. This pressure of increased patient numbers provided clinicians with the opportunity to investigate other treatment options. New surgical techniques including laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, improving therapeutic radiation by the introduction of conformal radiotherapy, neutron radiation, cryosurgery, high intensity focussed ultrasound (HIF) and the revival of brachytherapy with or without external beam radiation are currently being investigated. The goal of these techniques is to treat localized prostate cancer based on the endpoints of disease specific mortality, no evidence of disease, absent or low levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), reduced side-effects, improved quality of life and importantly increased cost-efficacy. It is important to remember however, that watchful waiting and endocrine therapy are still valid therapy options in certain patient groups. The lack of randomized, prospective trials on local treatment of prostate cancer, makes it difficult to compare the efficacy of the different treatments, especially in terms of disease-specific survival. Trials are now in progress but it will be several years before results are available. In the meantime, we need to focus on surrogate endpoints, side effects, quality of life and the cost-efficacy of each treatment. It is also important to ensure that patients are kept informed and up-to-date with any new therapeutic developments.",prostate cancer
The study included 164 prostate cancer patients with a history of acute or chronic urinary retention. Conservative therapy or transurethral resection of the prostate were carried out to all patients as treatment for urinary retention. There was studied an influence of transurethral resection of the prostate on the survival of patients with prostate cancer and development of radiation complications following radiotherapy. Overall survival of prostate cancer patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate was significantly higher than in patients who had only conservative therapy as a treatment of dysuria. The frequency of radiation complications was lower in patients who had transurethral resection of the prostate prior radiation therapy.,prostate cancer
"D-glucuronyl C5-epimerase (GLCE) is involved in breast and lung carcinogenesis as a potential tumor suppressor gene, acting through inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and invasion/metastasis pathways. However, in prostate tumors, increased GLCE expression is associated with advanced disease, suggesting versatile effects of GLCE in different cancers. To investigate further the potential cancer-promoting effect of GLCE in prostate cancer, GLCE was ectopically re-expressed in morphologically different LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cells. Transcriptional profiles of normal PNT2 prostate cells, LNCaP, PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells, and GLCE-expressing LNCaP and PC3 cells were determined. Comparative analysis revealed the genes whose expression was changed in prostate cancer cells compared with normal PNT2 cells, and those differently expressed between the cancer cell lines (ACTA2, IL6, SERPINE1, TAGLN, SEMA3A, and CDH2). GLCE re-expression influenced mainly angiogenesis-involved genes (ANGPT1, SERPINE1, IGF1, PDGFB, TNF, IL8, TEK, IFNA1, and IFNB1) but in a cell type-specific manner (from basic deregulation of angiogenesis in LNCaP cells to significant activation in PC3 cells). Invasion/metastasis pathway was also affected (MMP1, MMP2, MMP9, S100A4, ITGA1, ITGB3, ERBB2, and FAS). The obtained results suggest activation of angiogenesis as a main molecular mechanism of pro-oncogenic effect of GLCE in prostate cancer. GLCE up-regulation plus expression pattern of a panel of six genes, discriminating morphologically different prostate cancer cell sub-types, is suggested as a potential marker of aggressive prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is now a common disease in men over 50 years of age. Medical therapies for prostate cancer are based on discoveries from the mid-twentieth century, and in the long term are rarely curative. Most treatments are directed towards an androgen receptor-expressing, highly proliferative target cell, which does indeed form the vast majority of cells in a prostate tumour. However, by invoking the existence of a cancer stem cell which, like normal epithelial stem cells in the prostate, does not express androgen receptor and is relatively quiescent, the observed resistance to most medical therapies can be explained. The phenotype of the prostate cancer stem cells is that of a basal cell and cultures derived from cancers, but not benign tissues, express a range of prostate cancer-associated RNAs. Furthermore, stem cells purified on the basis of alpha2beta1 high integrin and CD133 cell surface antigen expression, from an established culture of Gleason 4 (2+2) prostate cancer (P4E6), were able to form multiple intraprostatic tumours in nude mice when grafted orthotopically in a matrigel plug containing human prostatic stroma. The final tumours reexpressed androgen receptor and displayed a histology similar to that of a Gleason 4 cancer.",prostate cancer
"In many developed countries prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death in human population. Prostate tissue is characterized by the highest level of polyamines among organs in human body, and it is even higher in prostate carcinomas. These ubiquitous molecules are synthesized by prostate epithelium and are involved in many biochemical processes including cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation and protein synthesis. In this review we made the attempt to discuss the functions of polyamines, their involvement in apoptosis and potential role as molecular biomarker for prostate cancer. Also we present recent data on generation of drugs, in particular, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, developed for therapy of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Although prostate cancer is of crucial impact as a common disease of men, numerous relationships remain unknown, particularly concerning its pathogenesis. A novel approach regarding the origin and development of prostate cancer is a phenomenon that has already been investigated in other human cancers: cancerogenesis due to chronic inflammation. Hence, the present review introduces the current state of research concerning the relationship between chronic prostatitis and prostate cancer. In addition to histological and biochemical features, the latest discoveries are discussed, including the relationship between the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and infection by the novel gammaretrovirus XMRV, similar to cervical cancer associated with HPV.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: The rationale for adjuvant therapy for prostate cancer was reviewed. Materials and methods: A selective review of the successful experience with adjuvant therapy in other epithelial neoplasms is presented along with discussion of the increasing success of chemotherapy to improve outcomes in advanced prostate cancer. Results: Adjuvant therapy could be effective for prostate cancer if men with high risk features, such as Gleason score 8 or greater, prostate specific antigen more than 20 ng/ml, positive surgical margins with Gleason score 7 or greater, seminal vesicle invasion or positive lymph nodes, were selectively given additional therapy after primary surgery or radiation. These individuals are easily identified by routine pathological findings and precise recurrence risks can be calculated with available nomograms. For primary radiotherapy hormonal adjuvant treatment has now been shown to produce improved disease-free and overall survival. Adjuvant radiotherapy following prostatectomy decreases biochemical relapse and local disease recurrence. Adjuvant hormonal therapy after prostatectomy is also beneficial in select patients. Adjuvant chemotherapy now has a powerful rationale since it has been shown to improve survival in other common epithelial cancers, such as those of the breast, colon and lung. Newer agents produce significant response rates in patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer, even prolonging overall survival. Conclusions: Only through dedication to a multimodality approach with all disciplines, including surgical urology, radiation therapy and medical oncology, will the promise of adjuvant therapy for prostate cancer be fully realized.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in men in the United States and accounts for 43% of all newly diagnosed malignancies. This year, approximately 218,890 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer (American Cancer Society, 2007). Of all men diagnosed with cancer each year, more than 30% will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Receiving a diagnosis of cancer can be very difficult and emotionally challenging for patients and their families. There is limited research surrounding the psychosocial and educational needs of men diagnosed with prostate cancer and the effectiveness of existing support services for this population. The purpose of this qualitative and grounded theory study was to explore the psychosocial needs of men with prostate cancer using a previously developed cancer model. Demographic questionnaires and focus groups were used with a sample of 16 men aged between 49 and 81 years. The results of the qualitative analysis revealed consistency with a previously tested breast cancer model and identified unique concerns of men within three stages of the prostate cancer experience. Implications for nursing research and practice are presented.",prostate cancer
"PGE2 is highly expressed in the prostate, associating with prostate cancer progression. Targeting downstream signaling pathways of PGE2 may represent an attractive new strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer. We have established a novel prostate cancer xenograft model, KUCaP-2. The expression of EP4, one of PGE2 receptors, was significantly up-regulated during the development of castration resistance. A specific EP4 antagonist, ONO-AE3-208, decelerated castration-resistant growth of KUCaP-2 tumors in vivo. Moreover, ONO-AE3-208 could in vitro inhibit the cell invasion and in vivo suppress the bone metastasis of prostate cancer cells. These results indicated that EP4 is a novel target for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.",prostate cancer

"Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF) convened its 19th Annual Scientific Retreat October 25-27, 2012, in Carlsbad, CA. Each year, this event brings together diverse researchers in a collaborative forum to present and discuss new and largely unpublished findings for prostate cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment and defines the challenges to ending this disease as a threat to life and well-being. Several themes resonated at the multidisciplinary meeting, notably (i) the roles of field cancerization, tumor microenvironment, epithelial plasticity, signal transduction pathways in cancer progression, and disease resistance; (ii) intratumoral heterogeneity and consequences for precision medicine; (iii) resistance mechanisms to androgen axis inhibitors; and (iv) advances in molecular imaging and therapeutics for better detection and treatment.",prostate cancer
"Nearly three-quarters of a million American men who have been treated with prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy experience an increasing prostate-specific antigen level known as biochemical recurrence. Although androgen-deprivation therapy remains a reasonable option for some men with biochemical recurrence, deferring androgen ablation or offering nonhormonal therapies may be appropriate in patients in whom the risk of clinical or metastatic progression and prostate cancer-specific death is low. A risk-stratified approach informed by the patient's prostate-specific antigen kinetics, comorbidities, and personal preferences is recommended to determine the best management approach.",prostate cancer
"Background and objectives: The purpose is to update the consensus statements on management of prostate cancer in West Africa. In 2010, ""Prostate Cancer: Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment in West Africa"" was first published. Since then, there have been several developments in diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. These need to be incorporated to produce a 2019 update. The aspiration is that it will serve as a benchmark for the basic standard of care for patients with prostate cancer in West Africa or even as a working document for the development of guidelines for treatment of prostate cancer by urological associations, other professional societies, institutions or government. Methods: A search of the literature was performed to identify recent studies. Those of relevance to West Africa, were extracted for evaluation to enable update of the recommendations. Results: There are three themes (screening/diagnosis, clinical pathology, treatment) with 20 guideline topics covering screening, diagnosis, staging, grading, classification and management. New evidence in screening, definition of normal prostate-specific antigen, and use of pre-biopsy magnetic resonance imaging, have been incorporated. Conclusion: This update will serve as a benchmark to assist clinicians in achieving best practice in the management of prostate cancer. It should also serve as a trigger for audits and research towards improving access to effective diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer in West Africa.",prostate cancer
"In patients with androgeri-sensitive prostate cancer androgen-deprivation therapy leads to apoptosis of hormone-dependent cells but it may select out androgen-refractory clones. The apoptosis of prostate cancer cells induced by quinazoline-derived alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists (doxazosin, terazosin, prazosin) counteracts cell proliferation and may have the potential of reversing or delaying prostate cancer growth. Elucidation of the biomolecular mechanisms whereby quinazoline-alpha1-adrenoceptor-antagonists are able to induce anoikis and apoptosis in androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells would be favorable for designing effective therapeutic regimens in the management of advanced prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate tumor initiation and progression to malignancy may involve upregulation of the androgen receptor known to stimulate prostate cell proliferation; other etiologic mechanisms may include dysfunction of the apoptotic pathway but also deregulation in signal transduction and control of the cell cycle in prostate tissue; such abnormalities could arise from overexpression or mutations in a number of oncogenes or down-regulation by inactivating mutations, allelic loss, or other epigenetic mechanisms in tumor suppressor genes. The advantages and drawbacks of various delivery systems (retroviral, adenoviral, liposomes) used for human gene therapy are being considered. Several ex vivo and in vivo as well as cell culture studies are suggested for the therapy of the human prostate cancer using transfer and expression of genes that might be implicated in prostate carcinogenesis especially of the tumor suppressor p53. Expression of suicidal genes in prostate cancer cells using prostate-specific promoter and enhancer elements as well as targeting of the androgen receptor or the insulin-like growth factor genes with triplex technology in prostate cancer cells and their metastases, is expected to be of therapeutic value.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: To determine if familial prostate cancer patients have a less favorable prognosis than patients with sporadic prostate cancer after treatment for localized disease with either radiotherapy (RT) or radical prostatectomy (RP). Patients and methods: One thousand thirty-eight patients treated with either RT (n = 583) or RP (n = 455) were included in this analysis. These patients were noted as having a positive family history if they confirmed the diagnosis of prostate cancer in a first-degree relative. The outcome of interest was biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS). We used proportional hazards to analyze the effect of the presence of family history and other potential confounding variables (ie, age, treatment modality, stage, biopsy Gleason sum [GS], and initial prostate-specific antigen [iPSA] levels) on treatment outcome. Results: Eleven percent of all patients had a positive family history. The 5-year bRFS rates for patients with negative and positive family histories were 52% and 29%, respectively (P < .001). The potential confounders with bRFS rates were iPSA levels, biopsy GS, and clinical tumor stage; treatment modality and age did not appear to be associated with outcome. After adjusting for potential confounders, family history of prostate cancer remained strongly associated with biochemical failure. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that the presence of a family history of prostate cancer correlates with treatment outcome in a large unselected series of patients. Our findings suggest that familial prostate cancer may have a more aggressive course than nonfamilial prostate cancer, and that clinical and/or pathologic parameters may not adequately predict this course.",prostate cancer
"Current approaches to the management of prostate cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, or hormonal manipulation either individually or in combination. With an increase in understanding of the etiology and natural history of prostate cancer, the influence of dietary factors on the disease is becoming more evident. There have been a number of studies in this regard that have demonstrated a relationship between prostate cancer and numerous dietary constituents including vitamins. The fat-soluble vitamins A and D have both been found to affect the growth of prostate cancer in preclinical experiments. Of the two, vitamin D has been the focus of greater attention in recent years, and there are indications that it may be useful both in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. This article reviews the current literature in this area to determine if treatment with vitamin D would be a viable management alternative for the patient described in the case study.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: We reviewed the pertinent literature and discuss high throughput approaches to the identification of molecular markers characteristic of prostate cancer. Materials and methods: A PubMed search was performed for expression array studies comparing prostate cancer tissues with nonmalignant tissues and serum proteomic studies comparing patients with prostate cancer and controls. Results: The expression of several genes may help distinguish prostate cancer cells from nonmalignant prostatic epithelial cells. A few genes, such as those coding for hepsin, LIM protein and alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase, have consistently been identified as being over expressed in cancer cells compared with nonmalignant cells. Proteomic analysis using mass spectroscopy has identified spectral patterns that have a significant correlation with the presence of prostate cancer. The optimal presentation of the spectra may depend highly on technical factors and experimental protocols have yet to be standardized among laboratories. Moreover, to our knowledge the serum proteins that comprise the mass spectral patterns of prostate cancer have yet to be identified. Conclusions: High throughput techniques have the potential to aid in prostate cancer diagnosis, early detection and developmental therapies. Markers with the potential to aid in diagnosis have been identified and targets for imaging or therapeutic approaches appear to be at hand. Mass spectral analysis of serum is in the early stages and it requires standardization of technical parameters among laboratories. In addition, the identification of target proteins will contribute to ease of detection and cross-laboratory verification.",prostate cancer
"In this article, the conflicting data concerning the androgen axis and prostate cancer development are reviewed in addition to how this pathway may be exploited to prevent the development of prostate cancer. The expanding role of hormone ablative therapy alone or in conjunction with standard therapies, the controversies of timing of therapy, and the completeness of ablation and its use on an intermittent basis are reviewed.",prostate cancer
MRI spectroscopy is a non invasive method for detecting active metabolites used as markers. Chorine and citrate are used for analyzing prostate cancer. MRI spectroscopy combines morphologic imaging and metabolic cartography. This combination allows a new approach for the diagnosis of prostate cancer in patients with negative biopsy and high Levels of PSA. With MRI spectroscopy the Local staging of prostate cancer has a better accuracy than with MRI alone. It can also be used for the diagnosis of residual disease and recurrence in patients treated with conservative therapy.,prostate cancer
"A lack of appropriate diagnostic tools for prostate cancer has led to overdiagnosis and over treatment. In a recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, Hamdy et al showed no difference in the outcomes of patients that had undergone either radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or active monitoring. In an effort to enhance clinical stratification, the development of improved, more accurate diagnostic tools is actively being pursued. Herein, we explore recent advances in prostate cancer screening, including biomarker assays, genetic testing, and specialized fields, such as mathematical oncology. These newly developed, highly sensitive diagnostic assays may potentially aid clinicians in selecting appropriate therapies for patients in the very near future.",prostate cancer
"Current therapeutic modalities for advanced prostate cancer are palliative in nature, with no effective treatment increasing survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Apoptosis as a molecular process of genetically regulated cell death has a critical endpoint that coincides with the goal of successful treatment of prostate cancer. Expression of key regulators of the apoptotic pathway such as bcl-2 and caspases within individual prostate tumors appear to correlate with the prostate cancer cell's sensitivity to traditional therapeutic modalities, including androgen ablation and radiotherapy. Androgen-dependent prostate tumors undergo apoptosis in response to androgen-ablation. Cancer regression after radiation occurs by disruption of the reproductive integrity of the tumor cells and via activation of the apoptotic pathway. Increasing the sensitivity of prostate tumor cells to die via apoptosis increases the efficacy of fractionated therapy by reducing tumor cell survival. Thus signaling interaction between androgen ablation and radiotherapy may be synergistic in maximally activating the apoptotic potential of prostate cancer cells. The role of molecular technology in identifying apoptosis regulation in association with combination hormonal ablation and radiotherapy for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer holds tremendous promise, as any approach significantly decreasing the apoptotic threshold may lead to total synergistic killing of tumor cells. This review is an attempt to summarize the current knowledge of the clinical consequences of sequencing androgen ablation and radiotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer patients and the molecular parameters underlying a potential optimization of such a combination strategy.",prostate cancer
"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is standard of care for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC), yet through its induction of a hypogonadal state leads to metabolic perturbations, including insulin resistance (IR) and obesity. IR and obesity have been associated with an increased risk of progression to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and ultimately increased prostate cancer-specific mortality. On a molecular level, this association between obesity/IR and prostate cancer progression may be mediated by alterations in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis, which has been shown to be up-regulated upon disease progression to CRPC. Targeting the IGF axis, either by anti-IGF therapy or via enhancement of peripheral insulin sensitivity, represents a viable therapeutic target in patients with prostate cancer. Using the development of IR and/or obesity may represent a clinically available biomarker that may predict those patients most likely to respond to such therapy, and warrants testing in future prospective clinical trials.",prostate cancer
"Many important features of the biology of prostate cancer have not been discussed in this review, which has emphasized the traditional criteria for characterizing the biologic behavior of the disease: volume, grade, and invasiveness. Studies of the pathology of prostate cancer found at autopsy or in the clinic, the natural history of the disease, and the results of treatment trials leave little room for doubt that large cancers, particularly those that are not well differentiated or that invade outside of the prostate, will prove lethal if not effectively treated. We do not know whether some small prostate cancers are potentially dangerous. Perhaps studies of nuclear features, DNA content, or oncogene expression will be able to distinguish the potentially lethal small cancers from the truly ""latent"" small cancers. We do, however, have strong evidence that every big cancer is dangerous. Autopsy studies have established that there are not two forms of prostate cancer, but one. Initial malignant transformation in the prostate produces an adenocarcinoma histologically indistinguishable from any other prostate cancer. However, a promoter seems to be necessary to activate the tumor and allow it to express its malignant potential. The strong correlation between the prevalence of large, proliferative cancers found at autopsy and the clinical incidence and mortality rate of prostate cancer in populations around the world strongly supports the concept of a multistep process in the pathogenesis of the disease. If McNeal's detailed volumetric studies are accurate, then we can estimate the proportion of ""autopsy"" cancers that are large enough to threaten the life and well-being of their host. This proportion appears to be about 20 per cent, and these are the undetected but ""clinically important"" cancers. The dilemma of prostate cancer becomes less puzzling when viewed in this light. In a daunting display of the power of the paradox of prostate cancer, Chodak estimated that if every cancer present in American men were to be found and treated, 75,000 men would die from the treatment, whereas less than 30,000 are expected to die of the disease this year! But this paradox can be explained by introducing time into the analysis, basing estimates on the lifetime risks rather than the annual incidence. For a 50-year-old man, the lifetime risk of developing cancer in the prostate is about 42 per cent, the risk of developing the disease clinically is 9.5 per cent, and the risk of dying from the disease is 2.9 per cent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",prostate cancer
"The role of nuclear medicine diagnostic bone scanning is well established in prostate cancer. This case provides an insight into the specific role that bone scanning plays in monitoring response to hormone therapy and an example of significant global skeletal response. The case highlights the remarkable efficacy of timely hormone therapy in high-grade prostate cancer with widespread bony metastasis. In addition, the range of hormone therapy currently available for clinical application in the management of metastatic prostate cancer is detailed. Finally, the case represents an incidental diagnosis of prostate cancer after evaluation of nonspecific symptoms.",prostate cancer
"Improvement of quality of life (QoL) has become a major endpoint in clinical trials of patients with prostate cancer. However, there still exist considerable methodological problems regarding the development of optimal instruments and methods for presenting the results. Within the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) a core questionnaire is generally used for QoL evaluation, combined with a treatment- and disease-specific module. So far, no official EORTC prostate cancer module has been developed. Previous and ongoing trials in prostate cancer have addressed the following issues: for localised prostate cancer, micturition and sexuality, and for metastatic prostate cancer, bone pain, micturition, sexuality, vitality, hot flushes and gynaecomastia. The future challenge is to incorporate QoL results into the overall evaluation of treatment in combination with survival results and economical considerations.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: Many advances have occurred during the last decade in the clinical use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) for detecting, staging and monitoring prostate cancer. We review the clinical usefulness and limitations of serum PSA as a tumor marker of prostate cancer. Materials and methods: The English language literature was reviewed with respect to the major contributions and limitations of PSA in present clinical practice. Results: Although controversial, age specific PSA reference ranges can improve the sensitivity for prostate cancer detection in young men and the specificity in older men. Percent free PSA improves the specificity for prostate cancer detection in men with PSA values between 4 and 10 ng./ml., and a PSA density of greater than 0.15 may better distinguish benign prostatic hyperplasia from prostate cancer. PSA velocity can improve the ability to detect prostate cancer when 3 serial PSA values are measured during a 2-year period. For prostate cancer staging PSA is most useful combined with clinical stage and Gleason score in multivariate analysis. Percent free PSA may prove useful for staging prostate cancer but further clinical trials are needed to determine its clinical usefulness. PSA is the most clinically useful means to monitor disease recurrence after treatment of prostate cancer. With ultrasensitive PSA assays it is now possible to increase the lead time for detection of disease recurrence by several months. Conclusions: During the last decade much of the focus has been on improving the ability of this tumor marker to detect prostate cancer. PSA remains the best and most widely used tumor marker in urology today.",prostate cancer
"Objective: The purpose of this article is to discuss the information that is important to note in imaging reports of patients with prostate cancer.

Accurate reporting of images is crucial for effective cancer treatment.",prostate cancer
"An increasing amount of evidence points at important roles for estrogen receptors in prostate carcinogenesis and progression. Of the two estrogen receptors, estrogen receptor β is the most prominent within the prostate gland. Although there is much yet to be known, the findings from the discovery of the receptor in 1996 until now point at a role of the receptor in maintaining differentiation and reducing cellular proliferation in the prostate. Moreover, estrogen receptor β is the main target for phytoestrogens, perhaps at least partially explaining the difference in incidence of prostate cancer in the Western world compared to Asia where the intake of soy-based, phytoestrogen-rich food is higher. The tumor suppressive capability of estrogen receptor β makes it a promising drug target for the treatment and prevention of prostate cancer. This review will focus on different aspects of estrogen receptor signaling and prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"In 2010, an estimated 24,600 Canadian men were diagnosed with prostate cancer (Canadian Cancer Society, 2011). Upon diagnosis, men and their family members begin an arduous journey of information gathering surrounding prostate cancer and its various forms of treatment. Men have to consider the impact a treatment may potentially have on their quality of life and, frequently, they experience decisional conflict and require support. In May 2008, the Prostate Cancer Assessment Clinic opened to receive men for an evaluation of a possible prostate cancer. Our inter-professional model of care provides support, guidance and education to our patients from assessment to diagnosis and treatment planning. A major goal of our diagnostic assessment unit has been to improve the patient experience. Communication is defined as ""to make known, to exchange information or opinions"" (Cayne, Lechner, et al., 1988). Nursing is the critical link for information exchange that is patient-centred and collaborative. The focus of this paper will highlight the development and implementation of nurse-led initiatives within our program to improve the prostate cancer patient experience. These initiatives include: a patient information guide, prostate biopsy care, patient resources, community links, surgery education classes and implementation of a decision aid. Communication is the key.",prostate cancer

"Transrectal ultrasound now plays a central part in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The role of ultrasound in prostate cancer diagnosis is to guide accurate biopsy, and current practice favours a systematic biopsy approach rather than targeted biopsy of focal abnormalities.

"Purpose: Many patients who undergo surgery or radiation therapy to treat localized prostate cancer experience an increase in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) after treatment. This study documents patterns of PSA recurrence after surgery or radiation to treat localized prostate cancer and quantifies the extent to which an increasing PSA predicts death from prostate cancer. Materials and methods: Posttreatment PSA levels were measured on a population based cohort of 1136 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in community practice in Connecticut between 1990 and 1992, and treated within 6 months of diagnosis with surgery or radiation with or without androgen withdrawal therapy. The major outcome measure was death from prostate cancer. Results: PSA recurrence followed a log-linear pattern over time. Patients who died of prostate cancer had a median PSA doubling time of 0.8 years (25th and 75th percentiles 0.5 to 1.4 years). Patients who did not die of prostate cancer within 10 years of diagnosis had either no posttreatment increase in serum PSA (40%) or had a PSA doubling time longer than 1 year (44%). Conclusions: Patients whose posttreatment PSA doubling times before the initiation of androgen withdrawal therapy are less than 1 year are at high risk of dying of prostate cancer within 10 years of diagnosis. Men with PSA recurrences that are doubling at rates greater than 1 year are at low risk of death from prostate cancer within 10 years of diagnosis.",prostate cancer
"Background: Previous Commission on Cancer studies on prostate cancer have examined time trends in disease stage, treatment patterns, and survival. The most current National Cancer Data Base data for prostate cancer are reviewed in this report. Methods: Two Calls for Data have yielded a total of 85,813 prostate cancer reports from hospital registries across the country. Results: The proportion of early stage, curable prostate cancers diagnosed in the United States has increased. In 1990, African-American patients were more likely to be diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer than were non-Hispanic whites. The proportion of patients treated by prostatectomy increased between 1974 and 1990. Consistent with the pattern of more advanced disease at diagnosis, African-American patients were less likely to have received prostatectomy or radiation treatment and more likely to have received only hormonal treatment. Prostate cancer survival was associated strongly with disease stage. African-American men had a lower 5-year survival than did non-Hispanic white men. Conclusions: This information provides national points of reference against which individual hospital performance can be compared and should be particularly helpful to cancer committees, tumor boards, and cancer registrars for the monitoring and evaluation of prostate cancer management in hospital cancer programs. Not all segments of the population-at-risk are benefiting from earlier detection of prostate cancer. Improvements in early detection have important consequences for treatment patterns, allowing the increased use of curative surgical or radiotherapeutic treatment.",prostate cancer
"Consideration of the number of prostate biopsy samples found to be positive for cancer may add clinically useful information to T stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen level in predicting outcome after radical prostatectomy. Higher radiation doses and neoadjuvant hormone therapy has been applied successfully to patients with higher risk disease. Brachytherapy has emerged as a modality for localized prostate cancer with outcomes and toxicity being further defined. Efforts to measure and improve quality of life are an important part of prostate cancer research. Standard management of metastatic disease remains androgen ablation, with long-term side effects being recognized. Newer hormonal and chemotherapeutic agents are being explored for patients with metastatic disease.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer remains the most common noncutaneous human malignancy, and the second most lethal tumour among men. The clinical presentation of this tumour has recently completely changed, which is followed with the new diagnostic and therapeutic approach. However, the natural history of the disease is often prolonged, and the survival benefits of local therapy for men with low-risk tumours may not be realized for a decade or more, as is increasingly well demonstrated in long-term observational cohorts in both Europe and United States. A significant proportion of men with prostate cancer is over-diagnosed, in the sense that diagnosis may not improve their lifespan or quality of life. However, the extent to which over-diagnosis represents a true problem relates to the consistency with which diagnosis leads invariably to active treatment. Mainly due to PSA screening, prostate cancer is diagnosed at progressively earlier stages and with lower risk features; despite these trends, there are less patients now than a decade ago who undergo a trial of active surveillance only. Rates of brachytherapy and hormonal therapy have risen markedly. Important progress has been achieved in recent years in prostate cancer risk assessment. These advances, in combination with biomarkers in later stages of development, should be expected in the next years to yield further improvements in clinicians' ability to diagnose prostate cancer early, and guide appropriately selected patients toward the tailored treatment.",prostate cancer
"Histologic grading remains the most useful tissue-based predictor of prognosis of prostate cancer. The Gleason system is now the only grading system recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for prostatic carcinoma. In recent years, there has been a gradual shift of how the Gleason grading is applied in practice. There has been a general trend toward upgrading of prostate cancer. A consensus conference was organized in 2005 by the International Society of Urological Pathology with the purpose to standardize both the perception of histologic patterns and how grade information is compiled and reported. The recommendations regarding pattern interpretation are summarized and discussed in this review.",prostate cancer
"Cancer of the prostate gland is one of the most common malignancies in affluent nations, in part due to the application of new screening and diagnostic tools. The development of life-threatening prostate cancer is the culmination of a complex series of initiation and promotional events over a period of decades and under the influence of many interacting genetic and environmental factors. A rapidly accumulating scientific literature provides compelling evidence for the hypothesis that diet and nutrition are important factors modifying risk of prostate cancer. Additional resources devoted to interactive research efforts by laboratory scientists and epidemiologists will provide further enlightenment and continued refinement of our assessment of risks and benefits for specific nutrients and dietary patterns. These studies provide hope that evidence-based dietary interventions will significantly impact the risk of prostate cancer and enhance the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.",prostate cancer
"As longevity has improved and mortality from cardiovascular and other diseases has declined, the risk of death from prostate cancer has increased steadily. Though slow growing, prostate cancer is not a benign disease. Nearly 10% of men in Western countries will be diagnosed with prostate cancer sometime during their life and 3% will die of the disease. The prospects for long-term control of prostate cancer diminish rapidly once the cancer has spread beyond the immediate periprostatic tissue. The 5-year survival rate for men with metastases is less than 30% and almost all will eventually die of their disease. A simple blood test, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is available. This test, when used in conjunction with ultrasound-guided systematic needle biopsy of the prostate, will detect potentially lethal prostate cancers earlier than digital rectal examination (DRE). Definitive treatment, especially with radical prostatectomy, can eradicate the tumor in 90% of patients if the cancer is still confined to the prostate pathologically, regardless of the tumor grade. Randomized, prospective clinical trials are now underway to demonstrate conclusively whether screening or early definitive therapy will substantially reduce the mortality rate from this disease. Until the results of these trials are available, we recommend that healthy men over age 50, who have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer, have an annual PSA and DRE to detect prostate cancer while it is still curable.",prostate cancer
"Background: We analyzed the racial differences in physical well-being, social/family well-being, functional well-being, emotional well-being, and prostate cancer specific worry among men with clinically localized prostate cancer. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we recruited 121 Caucasian and 77 African American men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Participants completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) instrument at baseline and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months follow-up. To determine the between and within group differences on all functional measures (physical well-being, social/family well-being, functional well-being, emotional well-being, and prostate cancer specific concerns), we used repeated measures ANOVA. Results: Except for education, income and hospital type, the two racial groups had comparable socio-demographic and clinical attributes. At 3 months post-treatment, both groups experienced a decline in physical well-being and increase in prostate cancer specific concerns. Baseline values of these measures were not recovered by 24-month follow-up. In particular, lack of energy was the most prominent contributor to declining physical well-being. The ability to have and maintain an erection was the most severe prostate cancer specific concern. Lack of energy and concern regarding erection ability varied between the two groups over the follow-up period. Conclusions: Our findings provide an insight into not only the overall racial variation in physical health and prostate cancer specific concern, but also the temporal differences in these measures that can occur over a 24-month follow-up. This has important implications for effective management of localized prostate cancer patients from different racial groups and merits further research.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer, like most other solid tumors, represents a heterogeneous entity consisting of a mixture of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cells. Although proliferation of prostate tumor cells is often initially androgen-dependent, the inevitable development of androgen-insensitivity in late-stage prostate cancer renders androgen-suppressing treatments ultimately ineffective. Non-hormonal chemotherapy induces apoptosis in actively proliferating cells and is typically of little value, since prostate cancer demonstrates very slow growth kinetics. Objective response rates of < 10% and no improved survival rates have been observed in several hundred clinical studies using both experimental and approved chemotherapeutic agents. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the onset of the disease, as well as the factors that control the proliferation of prostate cancer cells, have identified key changes in gene expression during cancer progression, especially from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent status. Manipulation of the genes implicated in disease progression represent an important approach for therapeutic intervention. This review summarizes recent progress that has been made with the use of antisense technology with various chemistries to modify gene expression, a strategy that seems to hold great promise for prostate cancer therapy.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: Issues relating to the disease are critical in the diagnosis, management, and prognostication of prostate cancer. Recent findings: New data have emerged regarding the disease of prostate cancer and its precursors. The diagnosis of prostate cancer on needle biopsy has been refined because of the recent discovery of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, which preferentially labels adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Modifications and additions to the Gleason grading system were published based on a consensus conference of urological pathologists. Various models have been proposed using Gleason score, clinical findings, as well as measurements of tumor volume on needle biopsy to enhance the prediction in men undergoing radical prostatectomy and to predict ""insignificance"". Several studies have confirmed that certain findings in radical prostatectomy are adverse, yet conflicting studies were published as to the independent prognosis of tumor volume. The risk of cancer following a diagnosis of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia on needle biopsy has decreased to the point at which this author does not recommend a routine repeat needle biopsy within the first year following the diagnosis of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Summary: This review summarizes developments over the last year in the disease of prostate cancer and its precursors.",prostate cancer
"Differentiation status influences the prognosis for localized prostate cancer. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Mak and coworkers describe a signaling pathway involving estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) that governs whether prostate carcinoma cells maintain an epithelial phenotype or undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition, suggesting that ERbeta would have prognostic or therapeutic value.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common solid malignancy in men. Screening with PSA and DRE has led to an increased incidence of the disease, but has also contributed to decreasing mortality. Improved technology has led to treatments focused on maintaining cancer cure rates while minimizing the effect of prostate cancer treatment on quality of life. Recently, docetaxel has been added to standard androgen ablation as an effective treatment for advanced prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The age adjusted death rate from prostate cancer in Japan is one of the lowest in the world but is rising steadily. The vast majority of cases of prostate cancer remain undetected during life, the prevalence of prostate cancer detected at autopsy being 2800 times that of lethal cancer in Japanese in Japan, 570 times in whites in the USA and 470 times in blacks in the USA. A case-control study of prostate cancer carried out in Japan and the Netherlands revealed a number of statistically significant risk factors, including rural residence, more brothers, colon neoplasms in relatives, no morning erections, frequent sexual intercourse in 30s, episodes of sexually transmitted disease, lower plasma testosterone and dihydrotestosterone concentrations and lower beta-carotene intake.",prostate cancer
"Using a transdisciplinary methodological approach we have conducted a multifactorial analysis in Martinique and Guadeloupe in order to elucidate the aetiology of prostate cancer. In 2002, world age standardized rates of prostate cancer were 152 new cases per 100,000 person-years in the two islands; one of the highest worldwide rates and much higher than those reported for other Caribbean islands and metropolitan France. Using a linear regression analysis, we found that the growth curves of incidence rates for Martinique and metropolitan France have been significantly diverging since 1983. That these curves are not parallel suggests that although a Caribbean genetic susceptibility factor may be involved in carcinogenesis, this factor cannot per se account for the observed growing incidence. On the basis of mapping analysis of soil pollution, we further showed that water contamination by pesticides originates from banana plantations. Moreover, we have established retrospectively that general population subjects investigated in 1972 in Martinique for the presence of organochlorinated pesticides in their adipose tissue had been contaminated by extremely high levels of DDT, DDE, alpha, beta and gammaHCH, aldrin and dieldrin. Our study leads to the conclusion that the growing incidence of prostate cancer cannot be related either to a modification of ethnographic factors nor to a change in lifestyle and therefore suggests that environmental factors such as the intensive and prolonged exposure to carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive toxin pesticides may cause prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Objectives: To study attitudes regarding possible inheritance of prostate cancer among sons of men with prostate cancer. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to 69 men with prostate cancer and their 101 unaffected sons. All participants were also interviewed by telephone. Sociodemographic data were collected, as were data about the fathers' disease. Results: The response rate was high; 100 sons (99%) and 65 fathers (94%) answered all questions. Sixty of the sons claimed they had worries about having an increased risk of prostate cancer due to possible inheritance. About 90% of the sons wanted to know whether prostate cancer was inheritable (66 definitely and 24 probably), were positively inclined to undergo screening (65 definitely and 27 probably), and to undergo genetic testing (50 definitely and 41 probably), provided there had been multiple cases of prostate cancer in their family. An interest to know whether prostate cancer could be inherited was more frequent among sons with less than 12 years of education, worries about inheritance, younger age, a father treated with curative intent, and with children of their own, especially if sons. Interest in genetic testing was associated with less than 12 years of education and with worries about inheritance. Conclusions: A large majority of healthy men with a family history of prostate cancer were interested in knowing whether the disease could be inherited and were positively inclined to undergo screening and genetic testing. Our findings indicate that genetic counseling and a screening program could have beneficial psychological effects in families with multiple cases of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"In this review article adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies in patients at high risk for localized prostate cancer are presented in some detail. Adjuvant hormone therapy by antiandrogens as well as antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents such as estramustine and taxanes are referred. Neoadjuvant therapies in addition to systemic therapy before or after local treatment for prostate cancer may improve the outcome of high risk patients otherwise destined to treatment fail. Data regarding some substances used in neoadjuvant therapies such as androgen deprivation therapy and use of rapamycin with its analogs, as well as some novel therapeutic approach strategies are also discussed.",prostate cancer
"The American Cancer Society and other national medical organizations emphasize the need for routine screening for prostate cancer in men over the age of 50. The serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay is the test most commonly recommended for the purpose of screening. However, when PSA screening is examined critically from the standpoint of the principles of screening, evidence from prospective studies to support the routine use of PSA testing is lacking. Data suggest that screening often detects what may be indolent, nonaggressive prostate cancer. The treatment of such a cancer with radiation or radical prostatectomy can result in significant morbidity, including urinary incontinence and impotence, without a proven decrease in mortality. Evidence from randomized clinical trials in support of routine PSA screening is urgently needed.",prostate cancer
"Background: Previous Commission on Cancer data from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) examined time trends in disease stage, treatment patterns, and survival for patients with selected cancers. The most current (1992) data for prostate cancer are described in this Communication. Methods: Calls for data yielded a total of 52,597 prostate cancer reports for 1986/1987 and 101,903 for 1992 from hospital cancer registries across the United States. Results: Data were received for 154,500 patients with prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is detected increasingly at localized stages and among younger men. African American men have a continuing pattern of more advanced disease at diagnosis. Selection of prostatectomy as the primary treatment has increased, and its use varies by region and several patient and hospital characteristics. Selection of radiation treatment has increased to a lesser degree. The 5-year survival for patients diagnosed in 1986/1987 was 60%. Outcomes varied by stage, age, and race. Conclusion: The NCDB provides valuable information concerning patterns and trends in prostate cancer care in the United States. The data show that prostate cancer detection and treatment have changed markedly in recent years. These changes appear to be related to the increased use of early detection measures. The improvements in prostate cancer detection and trends in treatment have not affected the population evenly, with African American men having more advanced disease and lower survival. Continued monitoring of these important trends is needed.",prostate cancer
"Treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer remains controversial. Treatment options include radical prostatectomy (PR), radiotherapy (RT) and hormonotherapy (HT). A Medline database search with key words ""prostate cancer"", ""locally advanced"", ""high risk"" and ""treatment"" in articles published during the last 15 years was done. Fifty one out of 329 papers were selected and reviewed. Selection criteria were a minimum of scientific evidence level of IIa, except for some specific level IV reference. Numerous randomized studies show that patients may benefit of a combined therapy with RT and HT. RP has shown its usefulness in selected cases of locally advanced prostate cancer. Results of long follow-up series are similar to those obtained with RT and HT. Furthermore, the possibility of clinical over staging is an argument in favour of RP. We perform an updated revision of every possible choice available in the treatment of these tumours.",prostate cancer
"The causes of prostate cancer reflect a complex interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Improvement in screening has reduced the incidence of prostate cancer, and risk assessment schemata have enhanced therapy, both for localized disease and for locally recurrent prostate cancer. The use of hormone therapy has been further evaluated, as primary therapy for locally advanced cancers, for lymph node-positive cancers, and for de novo metastatic cancer. Modest inroads have been made in the treatment and understanding of androgen-independent prostate cancer. Advances have been made in the understanding of the risk factors, genetic and environmental, associated with the development and progression of prostate cancer; in screening; and in optimizing therapy for localized, locally recurrent, and advanced disease. This article reviews the most salient observations reported between November 1, 1997 and October 31, 1998.",prostate cancer
"The management of prostate cancer is a complex issue with a varying range of treatment options available. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the prostate has been available for sometime but has the limitation of only anatomical evaluation. Three-dimensional MR spectroscopy is emerging as a new and sensitive tool in the metabolic evaluation of prostate cancer. This article reviews the principle, techniques, and methods of evaluation of spectroscopy and also discusses the applications of spectroscopy in the current management of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is one of the most significant cancers of men all over the world. The microRNAs (miRNAs) possess crucial functions in pathogenesis of the disease and its gain of androgen independency. The miRNAs are small, approximately 18-24 nucleotides, non-coding, endogenously synthesized RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. They are found in viruses, plants, and animal cells. The miRNAs have critical functions in gene expression and their dysregulation may cause tumor formation and progression of several diseases. Here, we have reviewed the most current literature to elucidate the function of miRNAs in human prostate cancer. We believe that this will help investigators not only working in prostate cancer, but also studying the miRNAs in other diseases to delineate the functions of miRNAs implicated in human prostate cancer development and progression.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: We reviewed recent series of watchful waiting for prostate cancer to place this management strategy in appropriate perspective Materials and methods: We reviewed the literature and analyzed the 9 articles on watchful waiting published in leading medical journals in the last decade. Results: Watchful waiting is probably the best treatment option for men with well and perhaps moderately differentiated, low volume prostate cancer who have a life expectancy of less than 10 years. However, the conclusions derived from watchful waiting studies of older men cannot and should not be applied to younger, healthier men or to those with more advanced or aggressive disease. If treated ineffectively, many of these men will die of prostate cancer. Conclusions: Most men with prostate cancer who have a life expectancy greater than 10 to 15 years should be treated with curative intent.",prostate cancer
"The prediction of life expectancy in prostate cancer screening and treatment is a controversial topic that evokes various opinions regarding its validity. The authors believe incorporating life expectancy prediction into the treatment algorithms for prostate cancer is important. Using a combination of clinical judgment and specific predictive tools, physicians can estimate the life expectancy of patients with prostate cancer. These estimates can then be used to help guide treatment discussion. Estimating life expectancy benefits older men in whom decisions regarding the best form of treatment may be difficult.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is now the commonest cancer diagnosed in Australia. In 2005 there were 5913 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in New South Wales alone (31% of male cancers; 17% of all cancers). However, that year there were only 980 deaths from prostate cancer in NSW, and so prostate cancer dropped to be the fourth commonest cause of cancer death, ahead of breast cancer with 877 deaths. This discrepancy is a major cause of the angst experienced in the detection and management of prostate cancer. What is needed is a way to separate the significant prostate cancers from the insignificant ones, and accept that identifying them is a very different issue to managing them aggressively.",prostate cancer
"Throughout the past decade, significant improvements in optimizing the management of T3 prostate cancer have been made. Phase III randomized studies have demonstrated the superiority of combined hormone therapy and radiation therapy over radiation therapy alone. Radiotherapy dose escalation using conformal techniques has improved local control and lowered toxicity. These advances have changed the approach to treatment of T3 prostate cancer from that directed at palliation of symptoms to earlier interventions directed at prolongation of survival. The contemporary role of radiation therapy in clinical T3 prostate cancer in the context of other treatment options is reviewed in this article.",prostate cancer
"The increasing incidence of prostate cancer stood for years as a seemingly unshakable axiom of modern medicine. Recent evidence illustrates that the incidence of prostate cancer may have peaked and raises questions about the relative meaning of prostate cancer in the future. This article reviews the many antagonistic factors that will affect prostate cancer incidence and mortality. No projections are offered about incidence and mortality, but it is believed that the number of patient-years with prostate cancer will increase and present new clinical challenges.",prostate cancer
"The applications of combined MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging of prostate cancer have expanded significantly over the past 10 years and have reached the point of clinical trial results to test robustness and clinical significance. MR spectroscopic imaging extends the diagnostic evaluation of prostate cancer beyond the morphologic information provided by MR imaging throughout the detection of cellular metabolites. The combined metabolic and anatomic information provided by MR imaging and MR spectroscopic imaging has allowed a more accurate assessment of the presence, location, extent, and aggressiveness of prostate cancer both before and after treatment. This information has already demonstrated the ability to improve therapeutic planning for individual prostate cancer patients and shows great promise in the assessment of therapeutic response and the evaluation of new treatment regimes.",prostate cancer
"Those involved in prostate cancer treatment are often frustrated by the surfeit of careful comparative studies. This frustration is also true in the field of recurrent prostate cancer, where no randomized studies comparing competing treatment methods have been attempted. With an increasing number of men undergoing treatment of localized disease and more sensitive methods of detecting or predicting local failure, a large pool of men suffering failure after attempted cure will soon exist. If any firm conclusions are to be advanced in the management of recurrent prostate cancer, then large randomized comparative trials must be initiated now. New paradigms in thinking about prostate cancer must be developed in order to account for the advancements in prostate sciences in the past 10 years. Serially sectioning of radical prostatectomy specimens with whole-mount evaluation has disclosed an alarming rate of microscopic extraprostatic disease. The sensitivity of serum PSA in detecting microscopic locally recurrent disease has revolutionized the diagnosis of this stage of prostate cancer. Analysis of the DNA ploidy of tumors now provides new prognostic information apart from grade and stage of the primary lesion, and this technique should be used to stratify treatment groups whenever feasible. Carefully designed, multi-institutional studies would prospectively evaluate the benefit of early endocrine therapy versus delayed therapy versus radiation therapy in patients with the earliest stage of advanced prostate cancer--pathologic stage C2 or C3 disease. A prospective study of endocrine therapy versus radical prostatectomy and endocrine therapy should be attempted in patients with pathologic D1 prostate cancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",prostate cancer
"We examine changes in the detection and treatment of prostate cancer from the perspective of the urologist. There has been an extraordinary increase in the incidence of prostate cancer (60% from 1990 to 1993). We calculated, based on data from the literature and assumptions about changes in urological practice, that 52% of newly diagnosed cases would be treated by radical prostatectomy in 1993. Extrapolating from the work of Catalona, we derived the number of office consultations, prostate biopsies and orchiectomies associated with the diagnosis and treatment of these tumors. Applying Health Care Financing Administration reimbursements to our figures, we calculated that each urologist would realize $45,370 for prostate cancer care in the Medicare population in 1993. If all patients 50 to 70 years old were screened by American Cancer Society and American Urological Association recommended algorithms, this projection would be $107,919. Despite this enormous economic impact of prostate cancer on the urologist, uncertainties remain concerning the appropriateness of screening and treatment for this disease. Only increased funding for basic research in prostate cancer will resolve these uncertainties.",prostate cancer
"Cancer of the prostate is the most common malignancy in American men. Its incidence is associated with age, race, family history, and life style factors, such as high-fat diets. Some men develop prostate cancer before age 55, but 80% of tumors occur in men older than age 65. For organ-confined prostate cancers, treatment options include observation, radical prostatectomy, external beam or interstitial radiation, and cryoablation. The appropriate therapeutic decision is based on analysis of multiple factors by the physician and the individual patient. Advanced prostate cancer remains incurable, but hormonal manipulation and newer chemotherapeutic regimens offer palliation in later stages of the disease.",prostate cancer
"Background: Prostate cancer is the sixth most important cancer in the world, and its incidence in blacks has been on the increase. It is a very important cause of morbidity and mortality. In North-eastern Nigeria, reports on prostate cancer have been scarce. The aim of this paper is to highlight the clinico-pathological features and management of prostate cancer in north-eastern Nigeria. Study design: The clinical records and histopathological slides of all prostate cancer patients seen at the UMTH from January 1987 to December 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. The total number of cancers diagnosed during this period was also obtained from the cancer registry. Results: Prostate cancer was seen in 165 patients and accounted for 6.15% of cancers diagnosed in this hospital. Majority of patients (56%) were aged 65 years and below and most presenting symptoms were similar to those of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). The diagnosis was made in most cases on the basis of DRE, USS, PSA, and confirmed by trucut prostatic biopsy. Since most cases were advanced, the most frequent palliative treatment was subcapsular orchidectomy, which was psychologically satisfying to patients. Follow-up was very poor, only 26% at 3 years. Conclusion: Since most patients present late we conclude that prostate cancer should be suspected in men of 50 years and above who present with symptoms of prostatism and should be investigated promptly. Furthermore, aggressive screening of men in this age group would facilitate early diagnosis.",prostate cancer
"Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in United States and remains the second leading cause of death in the Western world. Because the median age of diagnosis for men with prostate cancer is greater than 75 years, PCa can be considered a disease of the elderly. Several disease-specific factors (e.g., stage, tumor grade, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level) and patient-specific factors (e.g., age, co-morbidity, and functional status) need to be considered in the decision-making process. In an attempt to incorporate these important factors to select optimal treatment for older individuals, several decision models have been published, yet their utility in clinical practice remains poorly understood. Current guidelines for the management of patients with PCa do not make specific recommendations for the elderly. Clearly there is a need to improve our understanding of the complex interrelationships between old age, co-morbidities, and their impact on expected outcomes.",prostate cancer
"Although bone metastases from prostate cancer are described as osteoblastic, markers of both osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity are strikingly elevated in men with metastatic prostate cancer. Elevated markers of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in men with prostate cancer--outcomes including shorter time to skeletal complications, disease progression, and death. Bone marker measurement appears to be a promising method for monitoring the efficacy of bone-targeted therapy. Additional studies are needed to assess the potential role of bone markers in identifying men at highest risk for development of bone metastases.",prostate cancer
"The pathogenesis of prostate cancer reflects complex interactions among environmental and genetic factors. Recent advances suggest molecular mechanisms that may explain geographic and ethnic variations in prostate cancer incidence, and understanding of molecular disease progression is advancing rapidly. Clinically, the case for screening has become stronger, and declining prostate cancer mortality rates may be due in part to early detection and treatment. Improved risk assessment for patients with localized disease is now available, although further refinement in predictive algorithms will need to incorporate validated molecular prognostic markers. Treatment options for patients with localized prostate cancer have expanded and the role of androgen deprivation further delineated. Finally, treatment strategies for patients with androgen-independent disease have also expanded, although novel therapies are required to improve survival in this group of patients.",prostate cancer
"The use of the NPCP grading system does not contradict the principle that an accurate prediction of tumor volume, presence, and extent of metastases, therapeutic response, and clinical behavior of prostate cancer cannot be entirely based on the grade of the disease at the time of initial diagnosis. The morphology of prostate cancer, like any other cancer, is probably no more than one of a group of parameters that are decisive for the prediction of the biology and clinical course of the disease. Nevertheless, the present data support the premise that the NPCP system of grading prostate cancer, among others, is a very helpful indicator of the extent and behavior of prostate malignancy. Table 6 illustrates the correlation between grades and stages of prostatic carcinoma that can be drawn from the preceding data.",prostate cancer
"Background: Prostate cancer mortality and incidence rates have been gradually increasing for decades in the United States, with an accelerated increase in incidence noted in the past several years. This study explores in detail the occurrence of prostate cancer in southeast Michigan from 1973 through 1991. Methods: Data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program are analyzed with emphasis on time trends by race, age, stage, and treatment. Results: Population-based rates for prostate cancer increased by 70% between 1988 and 1991. Increases are most pronounced for early stage disease and among whites compared with blacks. Corresponding increases in treatment with radical prostatectomy are also observed. Conclusion: Increased incidence of prostate cancer is likely a result of widespread use of prostate-specific antigen.",prostate cancer
"The incidence of prostate cancer rises steeply in men over the age of 50 years. Mortality due to prostate cancer also increases, but not at the same rate as the incidence. In the U.S.A., a man has a lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer of about 1 in 11, but his risk of dying of the disease is about 1 in 22-33. Tumor DNA ploidy is one of the predictive features of the growth rate of prostate cancer. Patients with diploid tumors have a more favorable prognosis than those with aneuploid tumors, regardless of the stage or grade. Patients with stage A1 defined disease (less than 5% of the specimen being cancerous) have a relatively low risk of progression (about 12%) and death (about 3%). Evidence suggests that transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is effective in removing disease in about 62% of cases. Expectant management involves following a patient and giving hormonal therapy or TURP as necessary. Four studies with follow-up periods of 4-10 years have shown that the metastatic disease rate ranges from 9 to 37% and that deaths from prostate cancer range from 9 to 16%. Results from animal studies suggest that hormonal therapy only improves survival if it is given at the time of tumor implantation or shortly after, though it can be effective palliative treatment.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among older men in western countries. However, controversy surrounds many issues related to this disease, particularly its most appropriate treatment, with a wide spectrum of opinions ranging from watchful waiting to aggressive therapy. Patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer, as well as their doctors, will have to make difficult decisions regarding treatment of this disease. In this article we discuss the current available treatment options and some novel therapeutic approaches to tackling the patient with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: The ability to accurately localize and target prostate cancer, whether for staging or future interventions, is an important concept in prostate cancer management. In this review, we describe the emerging technologies that allow for enhanced visualization and precise targeting of the prostate cancer. Recent findings: Uses of prostate-specific antigen and conventional prostate biopsy with image-blinded random systematic techniques have led to overdiagnosis of insignificant cancer and underdiagnosis of significant cancer. Active surveillance and focal therapy have become hot topics in prostate cancer management as the incidence of low-risk prostate cancer rises. For either management, it is essential to localize, characterize, and target the clinically important cancer in the prostate. Emerging techniques in ultrasound as well as MRI modalities allow for enhancement of tumor visualization, and characterization. Digital mapping technique of biopsy trajectory is an emerging technique that allows for three-dimensional mapping of biopsy-proven cancer lesions as well as potential future delivery of focal therapy. Molecular or cancer-specific targeting is promising for specific imaging and therapeutic approach at the cell level. Summary: Emerging technologies improve clinically relevant prostate cancer identification using digitalized multiparametric anatomical and functional imaging and enhance the ability to precisely target the known-cancer.",prostate cancer
"The intention of these guidelines is to provide a framework on which to base treatment decisions. Prostate cancer is a complex disease, with many controversial aspects of management and a dearth of sound data to support treatment recommendations. Several variables, including life expectancy, disease characteristics, predicted outcomes, and patient preferences, must be considered by the patient and physician in tailoring prostate cancer therapy to the individual.",prostate cancer
"Current high-throughput screening techniques using DNA arrays have identified hundreds of new candidate biomarkers for diagnosis and risk prediction of prostate cancer. Large-scale analysis of clinical prostate cancer specimens is a key prerequisite for the validation of these genes. We have constructed a tissue microarray from more than 2,500 prostate cancers with full histo-pathological and clinical long-term follow-up data and analyzed expression and gene copy number patterns of 16 different candidate markers for their ability to predict prostate cancer progression and patient prognosis. The best candidates were used to extend established clinical prediction tools (nomograms) that were based on nonmolecular data only, such as prostate-specific antigene (PSA), clinical stage, and histological grading (Gleason grade). Using this approach, we could identify ANXA3 as an independent marker, which was capable of increasing the accuracy of the clinical nomogram, thereby fulfilling the criteria of a novel prognostic prostate cancer marker. This approach of integrating large-scale clinical and molecular variables may provide a new paradigm for the use of molecular profiling to predict the clinical outcome in prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among Canadian men, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. Prostate cancer incidence increases almost exponentially with age; most cases are diagnosed in men aged 65 years or older. With the possible exception of animal fat consumption, no known widespread modifiable risk factors have been identified. Although the prognosis is good if appropriate treatment occurs in the early stages of disease, the ability of existing early detection techniques to decrease mortality has not yet been demonstrated. The considerable economic and societal burden of prostate cancer and its treatment, coupled with the projected large increase in the number of new prostate cancer cases as the population ages, make this disease a very important public health issue.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a frequent cancer in old men which increases with age and is associated with wide geographical variation. Even if age-specific incidence rates remain stable, the problem of prostate cancer seems certain to increase in absolute terms simply because of the ageing of the population. This will have major economic implications for the future, particularly in Westernised societies, with any temporal trend in risk serving only to further compound the problem. However, since the risk of dying from prostate cancer has remained unchanged in many countries throughout this century, it may be that the increased incidence may be the result of increasing transurethral resection of the prostate procedures or screening techniques which have increased the detection and reporting of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Fertility preservation has become an important aspect of cancer treatment given the gonadotoxic effects of oncologic therapies. It is now considered standard of care to offer sperm banking to men undergoing treatment for primaries that affect young individuals. Less is known regarding fertility preservation of patients afflicted with prostate cancer. This cohort has progressively expanded and grown younger in the post-PSA era. Prostatectomy, radiation, chemotherapy and androgen blockade all pose unique challenges to the infertility specialist. Optimum management becomes even more uncertain for those men with metastatic prostate cancer. Most of these individuals will have received multiple forms of therapy, each carrying a distinct insult to the patient's reproductive potential. We describe a case of successful ex vivo sperm extraction and live birth in a patient previously treated with radiation and chronic androgen deprivation for metastatic prostate cancer. The presented case demonstrates that conception after radiation therapy and chronic androgen deprivation is feasible. We propose that fertility counselling and sperm cryopreservation should be considered for all prostate cancer patients. Additionally, for those individuals undergoing external beam radiotherapy, testicular shielding should be routinely offered in the event further family building is desired.",prostate cancer
"Chemoprevention trials usually target healthy populations and employ non-toxic chemicals in an effort to eliminate, reduce, or reverse premalignant lesions or early cancer. Recent efforts have been directed at short-term Phase II trials which rely on changes in surrogate endpoint biomarkers rather than cancer incidence reduction as an endpoint. Chemopreventive agents are chosen that are likely to produce a modulating effect on one or more biomarkers in prostate cancer, including extent and grade of morphometric, genetic, proliferative, differentiative, and regulatory biomarkers. Five target populations appear to have the greatest promise in chemoprevention trials for prostate cancer: (1) Patients with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, a microscopic lesion which is the likely precursor of some prostate cancers; (2) patients with early cancer treated by watchful waiting; (3) patients with cancer waiting for prostatectomy; (4) men at high risk of developing prostate cancer; and (5) men from the general population (normal risk of prostate cancer).",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer can have diverse effects on patients' quality of life (QoL). Standard QoL questionnaires do not address all of the concerns expressed by such patients. The primary purpose of this study was to identify those issues with the greatest influence on the QoL of patients with prostate cancer. A secondary aim was to compare the performance of the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life-Direct Weighting (SEIQoL-DW) semi-structured interview with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate questionnaire (FACT-P). A mixed population of patients with prostate cancer (including those with localized and metastatic disease) completed the SEIQoL-DW and the FACT-P. The SEIQoL-DW was satisfactorily completed by 180 patients, including 93 patients with metastatic disease. Patients identified 144 separate QoL concerns, and these were then independently grouped by three of the authors into 13 distinct themes. The most frequently identified themes were 'leisure and hobbies', 'family' and 'health'. The themes that patients considered to be the most important were 'partner/spouse', 'family' and 'health'. Patients were most satisfied with their QoL in the domains of 'family', 'partner/spouse' and 'friends'. They were least satisfied with 'sexuality', 'mobility' and 'psychological factors'. Patients with metastatic disease rated their QoL significantly (P<0.0001) lower than other patients using the FACT-P, but not using the SEIQoL-DW (P=0.07). Patients with prostate cancer identified numerous QoL concerns that are not included (or are underrepresented) in standard health-related QoL questionnaires such as the FACT-P. Health-related QoL questionnaires may underestimate the QoL of patients with metastatic disease.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: Digital rectal examination is widely performed for following patients with localized prostate cancer after definitive therapy. This examination has marginal efficacy for detecting initial prostate cancer and postoperative recurrence. To determine the efficacy of digital rectal examination in terms of new information provided after radiotherapy we analyzed the results of digital rectal examination in the followup of patients with prostate cancer after radiotherapy. Materials and methods: We performed a nonrandomized study in 235 consecutive patients with prostate cancer followed at a large tertiary care military hospital between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 1999. All patients had been treated with prostate radiotherapy and had no evidence of metastatic disease at the first visit within that interval. Digital rectal examination was done at followup and the main outcome measure was new information provided by that examination. Results: A total of 1,544 digital rectal examinations were performed in 1,627 visits. New information was provided by digital rectal examination in only 30% of 286 abnormal examinations, of which more than three-quarters were related to bleeding and would otherwise have been noted on routine examination by the primary care provider. All 8 persistent recurrent prostate nodules were noted in the context of increasing prostate specific antigen. Conclusions: Routine digital rectal examination in patients with prostate cancer after radiotherapy may be omitted from followup protocols.",prostate cancer
"Reliable study results are scarce in prostate cancer for several reasons. The treated tumors represent a wide variety of natural history and therapeutic response. One assumes to select 'soft' or minimally toxic treatment for patients with good prognostic factors while aggressive treatment is reserved for infaust prognosis. Stage, grade and prognostic factors may influence the indication and choice of treatment. Better treatment selection will depend on the outcome of actual ongoing randomized trials, the development of new drugs or existing drugs in new indications and, above all, basic studies on the growth potential and invasiveness of the prostate cancer cell. Defining the correct treatment for the right cancer in the right patient is our clinical challenge for the next decade.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: To investigate diagnostic accuracy of detection of prostate cancer by magnetic resonance: to evaluate the performance of T2WI, DCEMRI and CSI and to correlate the results with biopsy and radical prostatectomy histopathological data. Materials and methods: 43 patients, scheduled for radical prostatectomy, underwent prostate MR examination. Prostate cancer was identified by transrectal ultrasonographically (TRUS) guided sextant biopsy. MR examination was performed at 1.5 T with an endorectal MR coil. Cancer localisation was performed on sextant-basis--for comparison between TRUS biopsy, MR techniques and histopathological findings on prostatectomy specimens. Results: Prostate cancer was identified in all 43 patients by combination of the three MR techniques. The detection of prostate cancer on sextant-basis showed sensitivity and specificity: 50% and 91% for TRUS, 72% and 55% for T2WI, 49% and 69% for DCEMRI, and 46% and 78% for CSI. Conclusion: T2WI, DCEMRI and CSI in combination can identify prostate cancer. Further development of MR technologies for these MR methods is necessary to improve the detection of the prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Androgen independence and bone metastasis are lethal complications in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Presently, there is no cure for patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer. In order to develop more effective therapies for this disease, the molecular events involved in the development of androgen independence and bone metastasis must be elucidated and then targeted by therapeutic agents. Several studies presented at a recent conference on prostate cancer sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) provided evidence that prostate cancer metastasis to bone is mediated by the prostate cancer cell expression of molecules that allow the cells to invade, grow in and stimulate cells in the bone microenvironment resulting in an osteoblastic reaction. Androgen independence was reportedly mediated by an increased expression of survival genes following androgen ablation therapies and several molecular mechanisms involved in genetic instability. Treatment strategies are being designed to target some of the molecular events involved in androgen independence and bone metastasis. Targeting these molecular events with combinational therapies will hopefully delay the progression to androgen independence in patients with early stage disease, suppress the growth of androgen-independent cells in patients with advanced disease and enhance the chemosensitivity of androgen-independent cells.",prostate cancer
"Controversies abound in relation to the treatment of every stage of prostate cancer and its natural history. We critically evaluate the controversies and information that exist. An ongoing autopsy project at Wayne State University aims to: define the prevalence of incidental cancer in subjects between 20 and 70 years of age; study the potential difference between Caucasians and Blacks; and to analyze other associated histological lesions such as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. Initial results note that there was only a weak correlation between high-grade PIN and incidental carcinoma, both lesions started to present at an early age with a progressive increase after the seventh decade, and there was no racial difference observed among Caucasians and African-American males. These results pose several questions which need further explanation. Most studies use digitorectal examination, transrectal 7-MHz ultrasonography and prostate-specific antigen for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer, we attempt to determine the best and most economical combination presently available. In discussing the therapeutic options for patients with localized prostate cancer, we review our personal experience with surgery and radiotherapy.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer treatments often affect quality of life and problems may present at any point during treatment. Measuring and identifying issues of quality of life (QoL) may create an opportunity for the patient to discuss problems and induce information transfer from health professional to patient and vice versa. Many practitioners already assess QoL in patients with prostate cancer because treatment for the disease can have a dramatic impact on lifestyle. QoL may facilitate a more holistic approach to patient care. Using a QoL assessment tool may promote and enhance the current service provision and aid identification of bothersome side-effects, for example loss of libido, gynaecomastia (i.e. abnormal over-development of the breasts in a man), and hot flushes. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate scale (FACT-P) (Cella et al, 1993) is a prostate-specific QoL assessment tool, which can be self-administered and takes little time to complete. This may be a useful tool in the ongoing management of patients with advanced prostate cancer. With the emphasis on quality of service for cancer patients (Department of Health (DH), 2000; DH, 2007a; National Health Service Improvement, 2009), it is paramount that health professionals continually examine practice and the quality of the service delivered. Addressing QoL issues for the patient with cancer should be a priority. This article will outline the significant side-effects that a patient with advanced prostate cancer may sustain and attempts to indicate how QoL assessment tools may contribute to care management and delivery.",prostate cancer
"The development of new technologies has stimulated a crusade of screening for earlier detection of prostate cancer. This effort has resulted in controversy regarding its clinical use in this format. Until randomized clinical screening trials define the value of prostate cancer screening, clinicians who use screening approaches must gain a strong understanding of the natural history of the disease, the strengths and weaknesses of available screening methodologies, and epidemiologic considerations of prostate cancer risk.",prostate cancer
"The discovery of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions in prostate cancer dramatically changed our view of solid tumors. Unveiling the molecular principles of the fusion illustrates the potential for clinical applications with regard to prognosis, diagnosis and therapy. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and delineate how genetic analysis of fusion positive prostate cancer cases can be used as a prognostic marker in clinical routine. The characteristic morphological features of the gene fusion and its detection in prostate biopsies and in urine make it a promising target to identify aggressive tumors. By increasing our knowledge about fusion positive prostate cancer, we will improve the possibility to offer target specific and individualized therapeutic approaches.",prostate cancer
"There were 35,000 deaths from prostate cancer estimated in 1993. The mortality rate among African American men from prostate cancer is 2-3 times higher than among Caucasian Men between the ages of 50-70. There may be many reason for this disproportionate mortality such as a genetic basis, diet or a difference in doubling time between the ethnic groups. Differences in access to care has also been suggested as a cause for this difference. But what has been clearly demonstrated is that African Americans are diagnosed with prostate cancer at a more advanced stage. Thus, health seeking barriers that delay the diagnosis of prostate cancer until cure or long-term quality survival is no longer possible, may be a primary reason for this disproportionate mortality. Since a higher percentage of African Americans present with advanced and remote prostate cancer, it seems reasonable to focus our attention on programs directed towards early detection of prostate cancer in this high risk population. However there are several controversies associated with early detection such as its benefit, over-treatment, and cost. Perhaps the investigation and resolution of these issues should begin in a high risk population.",prostate cancer
"In view of the increasing incidence and mortality rate of prostate cancer in Japan, the management of elderly patients with prostate cancer is an important issue now. We therefore analyzed the clinicopathological features and long-term outcomes of 182 patients with prostate cancer, aged 75 or older, in order to establish the treatment strategy for this age group of patients. There were more patients with advanced disease (stage C-D) than those with localized disease (stage A2-B), and the patients with moderate to poorly differentiated tumors were more numerous than those with well-differentiated tumors. The overall survival curve of the patients with localized prostate cancer was in line with the age-matched expected survival curve, while that with advanced prostate cancer was far below the expected survival curve. These results demonstrated that advanced prostate cancer in elderly patients is as harmful as in younger patients, indicating the necessity for early detection and treatment of prostate cancer among the younger generation. On the other hand, localized prostate cancer in elderly patients should be treated less invasively to maintain their quality of life.",prostate cancer
"In the present review we detail the more universally accepted selection criteria in the various protocols of active surveillance in prostate cancer; we also identify and classify twenty nomograms/predictive models useful for decision making in active surveillance for prostate cancer. These models are classified in accordance to their prediction (High grade prostate cancer in radical prostatectomy specimen [Gleason grade > 7], understaging on biopsy compared to prostatectomy specimen, pathological stage, indolent cancer or progression after expectant therapy). We also detail the predictive variables used in each model for estimations, their internal validation parameters, the samples used to generate them, and the external validations if they were done. Many of them are presented with their URL address, where they may be consulted on line, this making easier their implementation. Finally we expose our thoughts about the use of probability density functions as a useful tool for validation of these predictive models that help in the definition of cut points facilitating their clinical use and credibility.",prostate cancer
"Few would challenge the important health burden associated with prostate cancer. This concern, combined with the emergence of a biochemical test that has the potential for early detection, has fueled enthusiasm for concerted efforts aimed at early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. Reflecting the approach and perspective of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination, this report argues for the objective evaluation of evidence to address the question of whether to initiate and promote early detection campaigns for prostate cancer. Specifically, 3 questions are addressed: ""what is the goal of early detection?"", ""how should the existing evidence be evaluated?"" and ""how should evidence guide our actions and policies?"". After reviewing the evidence using its standardized rules of evidence, the Canadian Task Force has concluded that there presently is insufficient evidence to promote the early detection of prostate cancer in asymptomatic men.",prostate cancer
"Cancer cells encounter a hypoxic microenvironment during tumor growth and progression. In addition, androgen-deprivation therapy against prostate cancer can develop secondary to a hypoxic condition caused by drastic blood supply reduction because androgen drives angiogenic inducers including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibits angiogenesis inhibitor prostatic pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Extreme hypoxic conditions are not suitable for cancer survival, however, cancer cells soon adapt to a hypoxic environment and survive. We established a prostate cancer cell line cultured under chronic hypoxia and analyzed a castration-resistant phenotype. Here, the Vav3 was identified as a key oncogenic molecule associated with castration-resistance under chronic hypoxia. We analyzed the functions of Vav3 and Vav3-mediated signaling to establish a novel therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common neoplasm in men and a significant cause of mortality in affected patients. Despite significant advances, current methods of treatment are effective only in the absence of metastatic disease. Gene therapy offers a renewed hope of using the differential characteristics of normal and malignant tissue in constructing treatment strategies. Several clinical trials in prostate cancer gene therapy are currently under way, using immunomodulatory genes, anti-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and suicide genes. A continued understanding of the etiological mechanisms involved in the establishment and progression of prostate cancer, along with advances in gene therapy technology, should make gene therapy for prostate cancer therapeutically valuable in the future.",prostate cancer
"New gene expressed in prostate (NGEP) is a newly diagnosed prostate-specific gene that is expressed only in normal prostate and prostate cancer cells. Discovery of tissue-specific markers may promote the development of novel targets for immunotherapy of prostate cancer. In the present study, the staining pattern and clinical significance of NGEP were evaluated in a series of prostate tissues composed of 123 prostate cancer, 19 high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 44 samples of benign prostate tissue included in tissue microarrays using immunohistochemistry. Our study demonstrated that NGEP localized mainly in the apical and lateral membranes and was also partially distributed in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of normal prostate tissue. All of the examined prostate tissues expressed NGEP with a variety of intensities; the level of expression was significantly more in the benign prostate tissues compared to malignant prostate samples (P value <0.001). Among prostate adenocarcinoma samples, a significant and inverse correlation was observed between the intensity of NGEP expression and increased Gleason score (P = 0.007). Taken together, we found that NGEP protein is widely expressed in low-grade to high-grade prostate adenocarcinomas as well as benign prostate tissues, and the intensity of expression is inversely proportional to the level of malignancy. NGEP could be an attractive target for immune-based therapy of prostate cancer patients as an alternative to the conventional therapies particularly in indolent patients.",prostate cancer
"Improvements in early detection, staging, and treatment of prostate cancer were seen during the last decade, yet prostate cancer continues to account for significant morbidity and mortality in older men.

"Moleculo-genetic pathways of development and progression of prostate cancer have been studied. In the norm, paracrine regulation of the glandular secretory epithelium are predominant due to the influence of hormonal and protein factors of the stroma. The altered prostatic epithelium becomes independent from the stroma and androgens and, consequently, prone to metastasizing, following activation of protooncogenes (growth factor genes), inactivation of gene-suppressors, hyperexpression of certain growth factors and apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-2, and inactivation of androgen receptor. In inoperable prostate cancer, palliative treatment should include antiandrogen therapy, inhibition of growth factors and activation of apoptosis. Prevention and medication for prostate cancer targeting apoptosis, growth factors and androgens should be based on recent achievements in experimental genotherapy and selective use of proliferation inhibitors and apoptosis activators which are to be fed to the gland via viral and non-viral vectors. Molecular-biological markers of risk for cancer, its early detection, prognosis of clinical course and effectiveness of treatment are discussed. A modality for laboratory diagnosis and complex treatment of prostate cancer offering maximum survival so far has been suggested.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a uniquely problematic male health issue. Findings from a study employing an ethnographic approach are presented to describe the ways in which 14 men's lives were changed as a result of this experience. The theoretical basis of the study centered on embodiment to explore the personal impact of prostate cancer, its treatment, and its side effects. The findings suggest that cancer was experienced sequentially, beginning at the time of diagnosis with the problematizing of the normally ""silent"" male body. This trajectory of experience progressed to emphasize the importance placed on treatment side effects, embodied vulnerability, and the impact of the cancer on men's ""embodied"" lives. In this article, I focus on the final phase of the illness experience and illustrate how the men confronted existential threat alongside physical changes, and the way each change resulted in a new outlook on life and its priorities following cancer.",prostate cancer
"Urinary incontinence is a common adverse effect associated with treatment for early stage prostate cancer. The influence of this factor on treatment selection decisions by patients and their partners has been explored only minimally in the literature. Data regarding the actual incidence of incontinence associated with prostate cancer treatment are confusing because of the lack of standardized definitions of incontinence. Radical prostatectomy is associated with higher rates of urinary adverse effects than is radiation therapy. Brachytherapy appears to be associated with a low risk of incontinence, whereas cryosurgery is associated with significant urinary adverse effects. Including incontinence, urethral sloughing, and bladder neck obstruction. The influence of these adverse effects on decision making regarding prostate cancer treatment selection is difficult to ascertain. Research indicates that both men and their partners appear to have difficulty processing information presented to them regarding the probability of urinary adverse effects and the degree to which these adverse effects may have an impact on their daily lives.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: For men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, there are limited tools to understand the risk of disease progression and guide the treatment decision process. We will provide an overview of current prostate cancer biomarker discovery and validation strategies that are geared toward identifying aggressive, clinically significant disease at the time of diagnosis. Recent findings: The prostate gland exhibits multiple genetic events leading to both latent and clinically significant prostate cancer. Recent evidence from clinical translational studies has implicated the role of aneuploidy and copy-number variation as significant predictors of aggressive disease. Furthermore, the regulation of NKX3.1 by Pim-1 has provided a novel mechanism for the balance between indolence and disease course. Although promising, there are no routine clinically used tissue-based biomarkers for identifying risk of prostate cancer progression at diagnosis. The TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion has provided insight into the early development of prostate cancer but has not been unequivocally associated with aggressive disease. Importantly, the only platform relying on intact tissue profiles is the systems pathology analysis program that includes histomorphometry and quantitative multiplex biomarker assessment (including the evaluation of the prostate cancer stem cell) to construct prognostic algorithms for pretreatment and post-treatment assessment. Summary: Our objective for this review was to explore the effective use of prostate tissue samples, including fluids, to identify relevant markers of clinically significant disease. We believe that the inherent molecular heterogeneity in prostate cancer requires a multimodal approach, in the context of a systems pathology platform, to create the personalized tools for future diagnostic treatment algorithms.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer remains a common cancer diagnosis and cause of cancer-related death in men. Despite its high prevalence, screening for prostate cancer for early detection remains controversial.

"The aim of this study was to confirm the role of screening by determining the percentage of clinically localized prostate cancer (stage A and B) in patients with prostate cancer detected on screening and in those presenting to urologic clinic for the symptoms of urination impairment or ostalgia. During the study, 1,000 men aged > or = 50 from the community of Cepin and village of Josipovac near Osijek were examined. The subjects with elevated concentration of total prostate specific antigen and/or digital rectal examination suspect of carcinoma underwent transperineal biopsy of the prostate. Clinical staging was performed in patients with prostate cancer detected on screening, and data on clinical staging for prostate cancer patients treated during the 1996-1997 period were retrieved from patient files of the Department of Urology, University Hospital ""Osijek"". On screening, 28 (80%) patients with localized prostate cancer and seven (20%) patients with metastases were detected. In the group of patients examined on an outpatient basis for the signs and symptoms of prostatism, there were 30 (83.4%) patients with metastases and only six (16.6%) patients with localized prostate cancer. Study results indicated that an early diagnosis of prostate cancer could be made by use of noninvasive and inexpensive methods that cause no major discomfort to the patient. Accordingly, these results appear to strongly support such screening in men, if not in all those aged over 50, then at least in the otherwise healthy, 50-70 age group.",prostate cancer
"The objective was to investigate how prostate cancer and its treatment affects sexual, urinary and bowel functions and to what extent eventual complications cause distress. A questionnaire was sent to 431 men aged 50-80 years with prostate cancer diagnosed in 1992 in the Stockholm area (Sweden) and 435 randomly selected men with a similar age distribution. Sexual function, as compared with their youth, was diminished in a majority of all men. The prostate cancer patients were, however, more likely to report low frequency and/or intensity in all aspects of sexual function. A majority of the men were distressed by a waning sexual capacity. The proportion of men with prostate cancer who were severely distressed owing to a decline in sexual function was larger than in the reference group. The willingness to trade off an intact sexual function for long-term survival varied considerably among the men in the reference group. Urinary and bowel symptoms were less common than a waning sexual function in both groups, and few appeared to be severely distressed by urinary or bowel symptoms. A decline in sexual functions was the most common cause of disease-specific distress in men with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Almost 90% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer have a clinically actionable genetic alteration, according to a recently published study. Among these patients, researchers found that 65% had genetic changes that could be targeted by investigational or FDA-approved drugs currently used for other cancers, leading to new individualized treatment strategies.",prostate cancer
"Laparoscopic surgical techniques were originally applied to the staging of prostate cancer in the form of laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection. The efficiency of laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection has proven to be comparable to open lymphadenectomy in tissue yield and also shows a considerable decrease in postoperative morbidity. Subsequently, laparoscopy has been used as an adjuvant to perineal prostatectomy for preliminary dissection of the seminal vesicles. Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy has been performed but the long-term efficacy of this treatment is unknown at this point. Future clinical applications of laparoscopic surgical techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer include harvesting of primary and metastatic prostatic tissue for adjuvant gene therapies for prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Objectives: To identify complications of various forms of treatments for prostate cancer and their influence on patients' quality of life with the ultimate goal of suggesting a Quality of Life Questionnaire specific for prostate cancer for further validation. Methods: The literature was screened for reports on the more common complications following various forms of therapy for prostate cancer. Frequencies were summarized. The scarce literature reporting on quality of life in prostate cancer was reviewed and conflicting data were discussed and reassessed. Suggested questionnaires used in other studies were critically scrutinized and the various questions recorded. Results: Following radical surgery, impotence and incontinence were the most common complications reducing patients' quality of life. The literature was not uniform with regard to whether loss of sexual function was regarded as a worse complication than loss of urinary control. Following radiotherapy, intestinal problems and sexual dysfunction were the dominating side effects. Quality of life was best preserved in surveillance-only series. Following endocrine therapy, not only impotence and hot flushes were focused upon, but also mental dysfunction and intestinal dysfunction from nonsteroidal antiandrogens, additionally, the importance of effective palliation was highlighted. A Quality of Life Questionnaire should contain general domains relevant to cancer patients, cancer-specific questions, and prostate-cancer-specific questions. The latter group includes: worry for prostate cancer and its prognosis, bone/pelvic pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, urinary incontinence, urinary diversion, bowel function, sexual function, endocrine effects, and satisfaction with medical care for prostate cancer. Conclusions: A modern trial of prostate cancer treatment should be regarded as insufficient without including a validated Quality of Life Questionnaire.",prostate cancer

"Background: Men diagnosed with localised prostate cancer have to make a well-informed treatment choice between (robot-assisted) radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy and, in selected cases, brachytherapy and active surveillance. We developed and validated a questionnaire to determine the cognitive reasons motivating this choice. Materials and methods: The Prostate Cancer Decision-Making Questionnaire (PC-DMQ) was designed in-house and validated through the Delphi method. Finally, we tested the questionnaire in a cohort of 24 men, recently diagnosed with localised PC, before undergoing RARP (n = 16), EBRT (n = 6), brachytherapy (n = 1) or active surveillance (n = 1). Results: The experts reached consensus after three rounds. In the patient cohort, 75% of men undergoing RARP chose this treatment because 'it provides the best chance of cure'. Reasons to choose EBRT were not as explicit: 33.3% chose this treatment because 'it provides the best chance of cure' and 33.3% because 'the maintenance of potency is important to them'. Conclusions: The PC-DMQ is a comprehensive and standardised tool that allows further research into cognitive factors that influence treatment decision-making in patients with localised PC.",prostate cancer
"The incidence of prostate cancer has recently increased in Japan. Since Huggins demonstrated the dramatic effect of antiandrogenic treatment, patients with prostate cancer are widely treated by bilateral orchiectomy and high dose estrogen. As the incidence of cardiovascular disease has also gradually increased in patients of prostate cancer treated by estrogen in Japan, radiotherapy, radical prostatectomy, antiandrogen such as chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate and anticancer chemotherapy are now sought and tested clinically. The authors have emphasized multidisciplinary treatment according to the stage of prostate cancer. In particular, early prostate cancer without metastasis should be radically treated with radiotherapy or prostatectomy.",prostate cancer
"Prostate specific antigen (PSA) has replaced prostatic acid phosphatase as the preeminent clinical tumor marker in the management of patients with prostate cancer. Serum PSA levels have been shown to be proportional to clinical and pathologic stage of prostate cancer and in particular to correlate closely with prostate cancer volume. Serum levels of PSA thus serve as a useful adjunct in the initial clinical staging of men with prostate cancer. Serum PSA values provide a unique and valuable tool in monitoring prostate cancer progression over time and its response to surgical, radiation, and/or hormonal therapies. Unfortunately, its lack of specificity for prostate cancer leaves many questions unanswered as to the efficacy and advisability of using PSA as a screening test for this cancer.",prostate cancer
"The ultimate aim of the mass screening program for prostate cancer is to decrease prostate cancer mortality, which can be demonstrated only in a well-designed and well-controlled trial comparing screened and unscreened populations. However, no trials have been performed to demonstrate the effect of this program. Some reports claimed that such a program includes the high possibility of detecting clinically insignificant cancer, for example, latent cancer. In this paper, early cancer detection and treatment in mass screening program are discussed.",prostate cancer
Screening of prostate cancer in asymptomatic men over 50 years is subject to discussion. A review of the medical and economical arguments in favor and against screening is given.

"Even though the incidence has decreased, locally advanced prostate cancer remains a treatment challenge. Primary androgen ablation remains an option, but must be used judiciously as a high number of patients ultimately progress and die of prostate cancer. Unfortunately, while there is not good data that more aggressive treatment impacts significantly on survival, it does appear that some patients can be rendered free of disease. The failure rate with surgery alone has been high and androgen ablation has been used as a frequent adjunct. The randomized trials completed so far suggest that holding the androgen ablation for failure is as effective for survival. Randomized data with adjuvant radiation shows a significant decrease in biochemical and clinical failure, but a survival advantage is also not yet apparent. Historically, the results of primary radiation have been poor and have been only modestly improved with the addition of androgen ablation. In retrospective studies, favorable results have been achieved with dose escalation utilizing intensity modulated external beam radiation therapy or brachytherapy without the need for androgen ablation.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in Norway, with more than 2,400 new cases each year. Hormones, diet, and chemical and genetic factors are implicated in the aetiology. It is not clear whether alcohol and tobacco increase the risk of prostate cancer. Median age at diagnosis is 74-75 years. The incidence has increased steadily with a doubling of the number of cases over 20-25 year periods. Prostate cancer mortality in Norway is the highest among the Nordic countries and among the highest in the world. Five-year relative survival for all cases combined is 60%. Approximately 55-60% of the patients dies from the disease. The incidence is lower in the three northernmost counties. Elsewhere in the country the incidence varies between counties according to variations in diagnostic practice. Serological analysis of Prostate Specific Antigen after 1990 has lead to an increase in the number of new cases, mainly because of earlier diagnosis. Prostate cancer is often a slowly growing tumour which is clinically asymptomatic for many years. Latent carcinoma is found at autopsy in 30-35% of men above 50 years of age. Today, prevention of prostate cancer is not feasible, though specific advice about life style and diet might decrease the risk.",prostate cancer
"Methods: Salvage surgery was done in 43 patients who did not respond to radiation therapy of prostate cancer between 1982-1991. Thirty-five patients underwent salvage prostatectomy and 8, cystoprostatectomy. Results: The complications were significant; four patients had rectal injuries (all closed primarily), one had a ureteral injury, and there was one perioperative death. Urinary incontinence occurred in 10 of 35 patients (30%). Pathologic step sections of the prostate showed that only 13 of 43 patients (30%) had negative surgical margins. Follow-up (range, 1-10 years) revealed that 34 patients were alive, and 9 had died. Eleven of 20 patients were alive who were followed more than 5 years. Ten patients were considered to have no evidence of disease (undetectable prostate specific antigen levels). Conclusion: In selected patients, salvage surgery has a place in the treatment of prostate cancer after radiation therapy failure.",prostate cancer
"Expression profiling and proteomics have the potential to transform the management of prostate cancer, identifying new markers for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring and targets for therapy. Expression profiling has revealed that the majority of prostate cancers contain fusion genes resulting in the upregulation of ETS family transcription factors. New diagnostic markers to replace PSA are being actively sought using a variety of proteomic platforms. Nevertheless, no single molecular marker has yet been discovered that is any more reliable for predicting outcome than histopathological grading. In the future, small custom-built chips will be used to detect a small panel of RNA or protein markers to answer specific questions concerning patient management for each type of cancer.",prostate cancer
"In Australia prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men, with around 20,000 diagnosed each year (AIHW 2013, 2014). The many who survive it often battle with significant side-effects from treatment such as incontinence, loss of sexual function, fatigue and psychology issues.",prostate cancer
"The prostate cancer is a complex pathology involving oncological, functional and psychosocial items. The prostate's center of CHUV harmonize the know-how of urologists, oncologist, radiotherapists and clinical nurses to offer a global management to patients attempts by prostate cancer, from diagnosis to therapy and follow-up.",prostate cancer
"Multiple studies of the impact of lifestyle factors on the development of prostate cancer have yielded inconsistent results. This may be due to unrecognized heterogeneity of the study populations, specifically genetic polymorphisms, which directly affect lifestyle interventions. We review some known polymorphisms and mechanisms of action as related to dietary and other lifestyle interventions and prostate cancer carcinogenesis. Further identification of genes affected by dietary/environmental changes will enable knowledgeable lifestyle interventions on an individual basis.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most prevalent nondermatological malignancy affecting men in the Western world. An increase in public awareness has led to earlier detection. Accepted treatments for localized prostate cancer include active surveillance, radical prostatectomy, interstitial brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy and watchful waiting. The authors discuss the rationale for the different approaches together with outcomes including toxicity. Novel approaches are also explored. The management of locally advanced disease has long been a challenge and the evolving evidence is reviewed.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: To summarize current urologic measures in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Material and methods: Current urologic literature as listed by electronic literature search and retrieval media (PubMed, Medline) was evaluated. Current measures and trends in the diagnosis of prostate cancer were summarized. Results: Early diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCA) is crucial because PCA can be curatively treated only in its early stages. German general health insurance covers digital rectal examination (DRE) in men over the age of 45, however measurement of prostate specific antigen-serum levels (PSA) as a screening measure for PCA is not covered. Conclusion: DRE, PSA-serum level measurements, transrectal ultrasound and prostate biopsy are essential in the early diagnosis of PCA.",prostate cancer
"In a study published in The Lancet, long-term androgen suppression (AS) combined with radiotherapy, compared with AS alone, improved outcomes in patients with locally advanced but nonmetastatic prostate cancer. The combined therapy significantly reduced prostate-cancer-specific deaths at 10 years from 23.9% to 11.9% (P <0.001), and improved overall survival.",prostate cancer
"The place of endocrine therapy, either alone or in combination with radiotherapy and surgery, remains highly controversial in the treatment of non-metastatic prostate cancer. The authors review the results of isolated endocrine therapy or associated with local therapy. At the present time, there are few arguments in favour of the use of endocrine therapy in the following situations: isolated treatment of localized or locally advanced cancer prior to radical prostatectomy, after radical prostatectomy. Current data suggest a benefit of endocrine therapy in combination with radiotherapy in patients with high-grade localized or locally advanced cancer.",prostate cancer
"We evaluated 64 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (on the basis of rectal examination, serum acid phosphatase, bone scan and pelvic computerized tomography scan) by transrectal sonography before radical prostatectomy. Of the 48 patients with histologically proved localized prostate cancer sonography overstaged the disease in 5 (10%) and correctly staged it in 43 (90%). All overstaged cancer patients were scanned after either prostatic biopsy (4) or transurethral prostatectomy (1) established the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Of the 16 patients with histologically proved, locally advanced prostate cancer (that is extracapsular extension and/or seminal vesicle invasion) sonography understaged the disease in 10 (62%) and correctly staged the disease in 6 (38%). These data suggest that sonography is associated with considerable staging errors when used to evaluate men with clinically localized prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The ACS National Prostate Cancer Detection Project was established in 1987 to demonstrate the feasibility of early detection as a cancer control strategy for prostate cancer. Ten years later, the compliance results suggest that early detection programs can achieve long-term participation in a healthy population.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: We investigate the ultimate need for palliative treatments and hospital care in prostate cancer patients treated with noncurative intent. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was done of 514 prostate cancer patients who died between 1988 and 1990. Results: Of the patients who later died of prostate cancer 61% needed 1 or more palliative treatments (transurethral resection of the prostate, radiation treatment or upper urinary tract diversion) before death. An average of 5 weeks was spent in the hospital due to prostate cancer. Conclusions: Patients who failed deferred treatment (thus dying of prostate cancer) needed a considerable amount of hospital care and palliative therapy before they ultimately died of the disease.",prostate cancer
The review highlights analytics capacities of immunochemical and molecular-genetic methods used in the non-invasive test for prostate cancer and monitoring of efficacy of anticancer therapy. The perspectives of their applications in clinical practice also have been evaluated.,prostate cancer
"Results of conservatively treated localized prostate cancer are rather homogenous in different series if identical statistical methods are used- about 50% cancer-specific survival after 15 years, a rate much higher than that for men who undergo radical treatment. As the high mortality is accompanied by high costs, morbidity surveillance does not seem to be the optimal treatment in the average patient diagnosed with localized prostate cancer today.",prostate cancer
"Through the use of digital rectal examination, prostate-specific antigen and improved biopsy technique, it is possible to diagnose early stage prostate cancer. The management of this disease, however, has generated considerable controversy. The decision whether to treat actively or conservatively must be made on the basis of accurate staging and grading technique, a patient's life expectancy and performance status. This article will show the current staging and management of prostate cancer as practiced in Japan.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates in Denmark are reviewed for a 50-year period from 1943 to 1992. The prostate cancer incidence rate nearly tripled and prostate cancer mortality rate increased during this period. Until recently in Denmark the routine management of prostate cancer has been by deferred hormonal therapy. Morbidity and mortality associated with prostate cancer are analysed in a group of 1459 patients aged 55-74 years, who were diagnosed as having clinically localized prostate cancer in the 5-year period 1983 to 1987. In this group of patients prostate cancer is demonstrated to cause significant morbidity. Furthermore, the patients suffered significant excess mortality and loss of life expectancy.",prostate cancer
"Objectives: Quality of life (QOL) issues are important for patients with prostate cancer because side effects from treatment are substantial, while the disease itself may be indolent. This article reviews prostate cancer QOL studies. Data sources: Selected studies published on QOL in prostate cancer using validated patient-assessed tools from the last 5 years. Conclusions: Prostate cancer treatments are associated with side effects: prostatectomy has more urinary and sexual side effects, while external radiation therapy has more bowel symptoms. Side effects are not highly correlated with overall QOL. Implications for nursing practice: Patients must be made aware of potential gains in life expectancy as well as side effects of treatments to make informed decisions about treatment.",prostate cancer
"Random systematic ultrasonographically guided transrectal core biopsies of the prostate were performed in 73 patients with pulmonary malignancies to exclude prostate cancer as a primary malignant neoplasm. Of the patients 41 had normal prostates as judged by digital rectal examination, 27 had firm prostates and 5 had clinical stage B nodules. Hypoechoic areas were seen on transrectal ultrasonography in 14 of the 41 patients (34%) with normal prostates. Biopsy of the hypoechoic areas in this subgroup detected only 1 grade II prostate cancer. In another patient with normal transrectal ultrasound grade I cancer was detected by mapping of the prostate with 6 systematic ultrasonographically guided transrectal core biopsies. Of the remaining 39 patients with normal prostates transrectal ultrasound detected no hypoechoic defect in 26, a specificity for the detection of prostate cancer of 67%. Multiple core biopsies revealed prostate cancer in 15 of the 32 cases of palpably abnormal prostates, including 12 that were hypoechoic. Prostate cancer is a rare histopathological finding in men with normal prostates on rectal examination. Transrectal ultrasound detected only 1 of 2 low volume prostate cancers in our study group. Thus, ultrasound seems to have little use in patients with prostates that appear normal on digital examination, and its specificity is low.",prostate cancer
"Critical analysis of the evidence supporting the use of prognostic markers is needed for these to be used most appropriately in patient management. The College of American Pathologists recently sponsored a national conference to review the status of tumor markers for carcinomas of the breast, colon, and prostate gland. The conclusions of the Prostate Cancer Working Group are presented in this report. Currently, the TNM (Tumor, Lymph Node, Metastasis) staging system, histologic grading (Gleason system), and serum prostate-specific antigen are recommended for general use as prognostic markers in prostate cancer. Data support the use of DNA ploidy analysis in specific clinical settings, although general use is not currently recommended. The Working Group concluded that other markers do not have sufficient support in the literature to recommend routine use at the present time.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United States. Management of prostatic cancer has evolved over the last two decades based on a clearer understanding of the natural history and on improvements in the techniques of radiation therapy, surgery, and hormonal manipulation. Additionally, better methods of prevention and treatment of complications have helped to provide curative therapies for more patients of all ages. Discussion on these topics is followed by a section on special problems in management of elderly patients with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The extensive use of prostate-specific antigen determination has considerably increased the incidence of prostate cancer. Due to earlier diagnosis, localized small cancers are found that in all probability are clinically insignificant. Overdiagnosis leads to overtreatment and to significant adverse effects. Localized prostate cancers of elderly patients having multiple diseases have often merely been monitored without therapy. Active monitoring should now be adventured also for younger men, whose tumor fulfils the criteria of minimal cancer.",prostate cancer
"We analyzed the primary symptoms and clinical stage before and after 1988 when the prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurement was introduced in 491 patients with prostate cancer diagnosed in our hospital between 1976 and 1996. Most primary symptoms were related to problems with urination both before and after 1988. However, after PSA measurement became available, the number of patients referred to our hospital by non-urologists increased significantly. In contrast, the frequency of patients with stage D2 disease decreased significantly and the frequency of patients with early prostate cancer (stage A and B) did not increase. Few patients with prostate cancer had PSA levels of 4 to 10 ng/ml. We suggest that general use of PSA for prostate cancer screening by non-urologists does not contribute to the early detection of prostate cancer, most likely because few patients with prostate cancer have low PSA levels.",prostate cancer
"Originally described in 1964 as an idiopathic dermatosis occurring in women, Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is associated with malignancy, typically haematological. We report a case occurring in a man receiving radical radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate cancer. To our knowledge, prostate cancer associated with Sweet's syndrome has been reported only once previously in the absence of other concurrent solid or haematological malignancy.",prostate cancer
"The effects of stage and therapy of prostate cancer on the immune response were evaluated in 193 patients with an histologic diagnosis of prostatic malignancy. There was little or no effect, as measured by these generally non-specific tests, on the immune response. The host-tumor immune interaction is difficult to evaluate in prostate cancer. The complexities of measuring prostate tumor immunity are discussed and the literature is reviewed.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common malignant disease in Sweden and the most common cause of cancer-related death among Swedish men. There is, however, a wide geographical variation in the age-standardized incidence and mortality rates. The highest incidence is found in north-western Europe and the US and the lowest in the Asian countries. The reasons for these discrepancies are thought to be related to environmental factors such as variations in dietary pattern. High intake of calories, high Body Mass Index, and consumption of animal fat are all associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, while high intake of soy and other phytoestrogens, selenium, vitamin A and high serum levels of vitamin D are associated with low risk. As well, gonadal hormones and growth factors are believed to be involved in the complex etiology of prostate cancer. Genetic factors play an important role in the development of prostate cancer, and a hereditary form of the disease, accounting for approximately 5-10% of cases, has been identified. In order to develop effective preventive strategies to reduce prostate cancer mortality and morbidity, it is necessary to expand our knowledge about the etiology of this common disease.",prostate cancer
"The dog is a well-accepted model for prostate cancer in man because of the striking similarities between both species with respect to the clinical course of the disease as well as to its similar histopathology. Cytogenetic investigations of human prostate cancers has revealed the frequent occurrence of trisomies 7, 8, and 17. In this report, we present a case of prostate carcinoma in a dog characterized by polysomy 13 as the sole cytogenetic abnormality. Along with the known homology between canine chromosome 13 and human chromosome 8 these findings suggest that a homologous area on both chromosomes plays a crucial role in subsets of prostate cancer in both species.",prostate cancer
"In the past ten years, the treatment of prostate cancer has undergone remarkable changes. Furthermore, systematic prostate biopsy under transrectal ultrasonography or the measurement of prostate specific antigen has provided significant improvement in the detection of prostate cancer. Considering the increasing detection of prostate cancer, it is very important to clarify prognostic parameters in order to select the optimal treatment of given patients with localized or advanced prostate cancer. Recent statistical analyses showed that tumor volume, lymph node involvement and Gleason score would be significant prognostic indicators in localized prostate cancer. In advanced cancer, the response to the initial endocrine therapy might be a good prognostic parameter in addition to the histopathological features of primary tumors. In order to determine the factors which predict the prognosis of prostate cancer more accurately, the molecular biological approach is now ongoing, and may provide novel parameters for the decision making in the treatment of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
Annually the Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF) organizes a scientific retreat to assemble the premier prostate cancer researchers from around the world to share and review the latest progress made in the field and to evaluate future directions.

"Advanced prostate cancer patients frequently deal with intractable prostatic bleeding which is a difficult problem to manage. Intraurethral high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy may palliate this condition. Advanced prostate cancer patients with intractable prostatic bleeding were offered brachytherapy with Iridium-192 using a Micro-selectron HDR machine. During a 5-year period, analysis was performed in 23 patients with a median age and Gleason score of 78 years and 9, respectively. Following brachytherapy, haematuria resolved in 19 of the 23 patients and was recurrence free at 6 months. Intraurethral HDR brachytherapy is a potentially effective modality for treating haematuria in patients with advanced prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The generalist physician (family physician or general internist) provides primary care services and coordinates the care of other specialists for most Americans. These physicians develop continuous relationships with patients that can span decades. This therapeutic relationship is an important aspect of the services that generalist physicians provide. Generalist physicians serve as the first line of defense in screening for cancer and other serious health conditions. Prostate cancer is a prevalent and important condition. However, generalist physicians will encounter 10 times as many older men who will die of heart disease than of prostate cancer. Until more conclusive evidence is available to support the aggressive diagnosis and treatment of early stage prostate cancer, the generalist physician should refrain from screening for prostate cancer without counseling men about the risks, benefits, alternatives and uncertainties of early diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"In more than 50% of the cases, the diagnosis of prostate cancer is made at the time of extra-prostatic or distant disease involving poor prognosis for cure. Small tumours for which curative treatment is possible are asymptomatic. Thus, useful early diagnosis of prostatic cancer is based on digital rectal examination and PSA concentration. PSA levels are also indicative of tumour volume. Thus, determining dissemination becomes significant only in the case of elevated PSA, indicating a large tumour.",prostate cancer
"The best approximation of the natural course of early prostate cancer comes from studies on deferred treatment. In such studies, the 10-year disease-specific survival rate is 85-90% for patients with clinically localized tumours and 74% for those with tumours not confined to the prostate gland; 15-year data are sparse and diverging. Patients with poorly differentiated tumours have a worse prognosis than those with well or moderately differentiated tumours. Endocrine treatment of early prostate cancer is a revitalized concept, with the majority of the evidence for a beneficial effect coming from uncontrolled studies. Recently, however, data from two randomized studies have suggested that endocrine treatment may prolong survival in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer. Also, in studies of radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer, a longer survival has been seen in patients randomized to neoadjuvant or adjuvant endocrine treatment compared with placebo. The current trend for earlier treatment means that the total time on endocrine therapy has increased and patients are younger when treatment is initiated. Therefore, randomized studies should not only substantiate a possible survival benefit of endocrine treatment, but also assess potential long-term side effects and their impact on quality of life.",prostate cancer
"With intensified screening and the use of new diagnostic tools for prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen, rectal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging with rectal coils, etc), the number of newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer is rising rapidly, whereas the frequency of death due to prostate cancer remains almost stable. It must therefore be assumed that the number of patients in whom a diagnosed prostate cancer will not be fatal is also increasing. Consequently, not every prostatic carcinoma requires radical treatment when diagnosed. Also, it must be concluded that not every man who is a long-term survivor after radical prostatectomy owes his survival to the treatment. Long-term survivorship may reflect the relatively benign biological potential of this disease in an individual patient. Therefore, there is an inherent risk of overtreating patients and this must be weighed against the costs, the postoperative morbidity and the, albeit low, mortality of a radical prostatectomy. Nevertheless, as long as we do not have diagnostic tools which, at an early stage of prostate cancer, enable us to determine whether a carcinoma will ultimately have a fatal outcome, we are obliged to offer radical prostatectomy to younger patients (who have a life expectancy of more than 10 years) as long as they have organ-confined disease.",prostate cancer
"Fifty-seven patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated by radical prostatectomy or external radiation therapy following pelvic lymphadenectomy. Comparing the outcome of radiotherapy with that of prostatectomy in 42 T2 patients without lymph node metastasis, the 5-year cause-specific survival did not differ between the radical prostatectomy group (n = 31) and radiotherapy group (n = 11). The 5-year disease-free survival of the prostatectomy group, however, was superior to that of radiotherapy group (p = 0.01). To cure patients with T2 prostate cancer, therefore, it is supposed that radical prostatectomy should be performed. To improve the treatment outcome after radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery for prostate cancer has been attempted in our institution. Phantom experiments using a linear accelerator demonstrated a round dose distribution, and high reproducibility of prostate positioning was confirmed by CT when a thermoplastic immobilization device was used to fix the pelvis. In one patient with localized prostate cancer treated by radiosurgery, acute complication has not been recognized during the 5 week follow-up. Radiosurgery may be available to treat clinically localized prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"1. Prostate cancer is the most common cause of cancer in men in the United States. Although the value and significance of early detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer continue to generate much discussion, the array of diagnostic studies has increased and become more accurate. 2. The two most widely used methods in initial detection for prostate cancer are the digital rectal examination (DRE) and the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay. 3. The well-informed nurse plays an important role in the implementation and care of the patient, encouraging treatment compliance and monitoring the patient's response to therapy.",prostate cancer
"Background: Prostate cancer commonly presents with positive pelvic lymph nodes. The appropriate management of patients with prostate cancer is controversial and no satisfactory randomized trials have been conducted. Methods: Available literature was reviewed, particularly concerning long-term survival after primary surgery or radiation therapy with or without adjuvant androgen deprivation. Results: With surgery, 10-40% of patients with low volume nodal disease are 10-year, no evidence of disease (NED) survivors and with radiation, 10-20% of node-positive patients are free of failure at 10 years. Few studies include past treatment and prostate specific antigen (PSA) data. It also appears that androgen deprivation may improve survival after surgery. Conclusions: At least 40,000 patients of all clinical stages will have node-positive prostate cancer in 1992. A careful systematic investigation by prospective trial of the available treatment options is needed to establish the optimal management of these prostate cancers.",prostate cancer
"The paper discusses the 5-year results of early diagnosis of prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen density and prostate-specific antigen transitory zone density, which improves differential diagnosis efficiency.",prostate cancer
"The role of palliative radiation treatment of prostate cancer is well recognized. Appreciation of the value of definitive radiation therapy in management of locally advanced prostate cancer is increasing. Optimal management requires careful patient selection with multidiscipline evaluation to provide accurate grading and staging, availability of adequate facilities, and careful planning the treatment. Definitive radiation therapy may be used as primary treatment, or in management of endocrine treatment failure, and in postoperative residual or recurrent cancers. Similar techniques may be employed in the management of locally symptomatic Stage D cancer. Definitive radiation therapy is useful management of some Stage B and many Stage C locally advanced and nonresectable cancers of the prostate.",prostate cancer
"The incidence of prostate cancer is increasing sharply in Denmark and an increasing proportion of patients have clinically localised disease at diagnosis. The therapeutic strategy encompasses intended curative therapy: radical prostatectomy with complete removal of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles performed as an open procedure or laparoscopically, external beam radiation therapy, or implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate (brachytherapy). In older patients with good prognostic factors, active surveillance should be considered. The various therapeutic modalities are reviewed.",prostate cancer
"One hundred forty-six patients with clinically nonmetastatic carcinoma of the prostate were treated at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center from 1964 through 1976. Of these 146 patients, 24 (16.4%) had developed at least one additional primary cancer. This review contrasts the 122 patients who had a single primary prostate cancer only with the 24 patients who had additional primary carcinomas with respect to age, racial distribution, clinical stage, and prostate cancer histology including Gleason's score, patterns of failure of prostate cancer, and survival data. Local failure and distant failure were less in the multiple primary group. Patients with high Gleason's scores appear to be at greater risk for second primaries. Five-year observed survival (by actuarial life table method) for the single prostate primary group was 76.5%, and 5-year observed survival of the prostate multiple primary group where prostate cancer appeared first was 71%.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in elderly men. It is the second most common form of malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer deaths. The cause remains unknown, and only with early detection can this illness be cured. Unfortunately, early warning signs are rare, but any change in urinary pattern should be considered due to prostate cancer until proven otherwise. This discussion will focus on pathophysiology, diagnosis, early detection, evaluation, staging, and treatment modalities for prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"With Men's Health Week running from 10 to 16 June this year, there is an increasing focus on men's health. Prostate cancer may be traditionally associated with elderly men, but with improvements in screening techniques increasing numbers of patients are being diagnosed at a younger age, perhaps changing the view of this disease.",prostate cancer
"Recently the deaths from prostatic cancer deaths outnumber the deaths from bladder cancer which used to be the most frequent cause of death in urologic cancer. The management of prostate cancer will become more important in the future society with increase in the elderly population size, though there still remain several hazards to be solved. The present paper is a summary of 8 articles presented at the symposium on ""Management of Prostate Cancer--Current Status and Hazards"", 39th Annual Meeting of Central Section of Japanese Urological Association held in November, 1989. Mass screening in function with early detection, radical surgery, radiation therapy and endocrine therapy and/or chemotherapy of carcinoma of the prostate were discussed.",prostate cancer
"Not all cancers are suitable for screening programmes. The disease must be frequent, serious and able to be diagnosed at a stage at which it is curable and an easily acceptable and very specific screening test must be available. The justification for prostate cancer screening is controversial and this screening cannot be recommended on the basis of current knowledge. In this study, the authors evaluated, in the light of the recent literature, to what degree prostate cancer satisfies the theoretical criteria for cancer screening.",prostate cancer
"In patients with stage A (T1) and B (T2) prostate cancer with negative lymph nodes, the 10-year outcome following treatment with external beam radiation is the same as that following radical prostatectomy. The value of external beam radiation in stage C (T3,4) prostate cancer has been demonstrated by 10- and 15-year results in thousands of patients. External beam radiation has emerged as the standard against which new therapies for locally advanced prostate cancer should be compared in prospective trials. New conformal radiation techniques are expected to further improve local control and decrease the morbidity of external beam radiation.",prostate cancer
"Data from the American College of Surgeons' prostate cancer surveys covering nearly a decade of experience demonstrate that the problem of prostate cancer is unique among black men in the United States. These data show that the distribution of stage at diagnosis changed across the 10-year interval. The data indicate that there have been improvements in the 5-year survival rates of both black and white patients, but the prostate cancer-specific survival of black patients remains significantly poorer than that of whites.",prostate cancer

"Active surveillance (AS) has been claimed to avoid overtreatment of prostate cancer (PCa). It remains unclear which patients may benefit from AS. One way to clarify this is to improve the definition of insignificant PCa. PSA and Gleason score--the basic instruments used to select patients for AS--suffer from systematic errors. The nomograms used to define insignificant PCa are based on patients whose disease was classified before changes were introduced in the 2005 Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading; thus, the experience obtained cannot be directly applied to today's patients. Additionally, despite the standardization of prostate-specific antigen assays promoted by the World Health Organization, differences persist and could lead to misclassification of patients. These factors lead to an incorrect classification of patients into risk groups. Although new variables would increase risk group classification, the necessary first step is to optimize the use of both prostate-specific antigen serum levels and Gleason score.",prostate cancer
"For the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer, agents that induce androgen deprivation might be given several months prior to radical prostatectomy with the hope of reducing the size and extent of tumour prior to surgery.",prostate cancer
"Radiotherapy is an effective management option in the treatment of organ-confined prostate cancer with survival results and local control possibilities similar to those of surgery. Although radiotherapy is used in locally advanced (stage-C) prostate cancer, there are significant developments that may make treatment more effective, such as hormonal cytoreduction, neutron radiotherapy and conformal therapy.",prostate cancer
One hundred and twenty-two patients with localized prostate cancer were included in a surveillance study. The risk of developing metastases and dying of prostate cancer after 10 years was 20 and 15% respectively. These figures are comparable with results in recent reports on long-term follow-up of after radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy.,prostate cancer
"Because the present ability to treat and cure patients with prostate cancer is limited to those patients with pathologically organ-confined disease, it has become increasingly important to diagnose this disease at an early stage, when cure is most likely. Recent advances in imaging may allow the urologist and the pathologist to make the diagnosis of prostate cancer much earlier in the natural course of the disease. It therefore becomes imperative to have methods available to predict which patients have a high probability of progressing so that treatment can be assigned logically and appropriately. Our current methods of prognosis determination (stage and grade) do not allow accurate assessment of tumor behavior in the majority of individual patients with prostate cancer. Therefore, more accurate quantification of nuclear and cellular changes that take place as a tumor progresses to take on the aggressive (metastatic) phenotype are urgently needed. Experimental techniques have proven useful in answering these questions and now seem ready for large-scale testing in clinical studies.",prostate cancer
"With the increased incidence of prostate cancer, decisions regarding its treatment are now both complex and frequent. Accurate staging is crucial. Then appropriate treatment can be decided on, using nondogmatic common sense.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a major public health problem in the Western world, and the second most common male malignancies in the European Union. Detection of the disease is possible at an early stage, using serum prostate specific antigen measurement and prostatic biopsies. To date, however, screening for prostate cancer has not been shown to be of benefit to patients in improving outcome. This is compounded by uncertainties surrounding treatment efficacy, as more men appear to die with prostate cancer than from it. Studies addressing these issues are underway in Europe and the U.S.A. Clinicians are currently unable to advise their patients with any degree of certainty as to the appropriateness of treatment for prostate cancer, because of their inability to differentiate tumours that will progress from those that will remain quiescent. This article reviews the various clinical, pathological and experimental markers available, and their value in providing prognostic information, which may assist clinicians and patients in making management decisions. Further research is still required to understand the biological behaviour of prostate cancer and to assess the value of screening and treatment efficacy in order to advise patients, clinicians and health care systems accordingly.",prostate cancer
"In China, the incidence of prostate cancer has been increasing in recent years. Hormonal therapy has been the mainstay of the therapeutic options for metastatic diseases for many years. But many metastatic tumors progress at a median of two to five years and become hormonal refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). This article summarizes in the advances of diagnostic criteria, molecular biological features, prediction markers, new therapeutic agents and further researches to be undertaken concerning HRPC.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a prevalent disease that is characterized by a presumably long latency period and a moderate propensity to metastasize. Although a range of mechanisms have been implicated in prostate carcinogenesis, the factors determining the initiation of metastasis remain obscure. The synchronized function of prostate cells depends on their metabolic and electrical coupling; disturbance of these functions has long been suggested to be integral to prostate carcinogenesis. However, although connexins form intercellular channels involved in gap-junction-mediated intercellular coupling (GJIC), whether these proteins also have GJIC-independent roles in cancer progression and metastasis remains a matter of debate. Some data indicate a correlation between connexin expression and the invasive potential of prostate cancer cells, which points to stage-specific functions of connexins during prostate cancer development. For example, restoration of connexin expression seems to be crucial for the formation of invasive cell subsets within heterogeneous prostate cancer cell populations that have undergone aberrant differentiation. Consequently, the clinical application of therapeutic and prophylactic approaches focused on the modulation of connexin expression in prostate cancer cells should be reconsidered.",prostate cancer
"Many improvements have been made regarding the management of prostate cancer. The standard therapeutic options for localised prostate cancer remain radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy. However, some minimally invasive treatments are being investigated, including high intensity focused ultrasound and cryotherapy. In the future these therapies may replace standard treatments in selected patients. On the other hand, only few advances have been made in the treatment of non-localised prostate cancer. Locally advanced cancer is treated with combination of radiotherapy and hormonotherapy, and metastatic cancer is treated with hormone therapy. Docetaxel may improve patient survival in hormone-refractory disease.",prostate cancer
"Treatment choice for localized prostate cancer (PCa) is a controversial issue, and mortality risk is probably the most decisive factor in this regard. The study aimed to compare prostate-cancer-specific mortality risk estimates for different treatment options assigned by patients managed with active surveillance (AS), radical prostatectomy (RP) and patients who had discontinued AS (DAS). Patients initially managed with AS or RP (N = 370) were matched according to length of therapy. All patients completed mailed questionnaires assessing their mortality risk estimates (in %) and prostate-cancer-specific anxiety. Differences in risk estimates among the three treatment groups were analyzed using ANOVA, relationships of clinical and psychosocial variables with risk estimates using standard multiple regression. In all treatment groups, the prostate- cancer-specific mortality risk was overestimated. This applied whether it was the patient's own treatment or the alternative treatment option. RP patients assigned a mortality risk to AS that was almost three times higher than that assigned to RP (50.9 ± 25.0 vs. 17.8 ± 19.7, d = 1.48; p < 0.001). Anxiety was significantly associated with risk estimates for AS (p = 0.008) and RP (p = 0.001). Compared with clinical data that suggest that the prostate-cancer-specific mortality risk for AS is low and does not significantly differ from that for RP, patients strongly overestimated the mortality risk. This was most markedly so in RP patients, who drastically overestimated the benefits of RP compared to the risk of AS. This overestimation could increase overtreatment and should therefore be corrected by better patient education.",prostate cancer
"The search for a classic biomarker for prostate cancer has been on for a very long time, and it is still elusive. Despite the extensive and prolonged use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a screening tool for prostate cancer, many clinicians still identify its limitations in the grading of tumors, and monitoring of response to treatment. These limitations are based on the concealment of cancer by low levels of PSA, and over diagnosis and over treatment that are resultant of excessively high levels of antigens. To overcome these limitations, a plethora of candidate biomarkers have been investigated and identified. Regrettably, none of these putative biomarkers has shown ideal utility for prostate cancer detection and prognostication. In spite of these, various patents have been filed and granted for several of these biomarkers. The discovery of an exclusive marker for prostate cancer may be mired by the heterogeneity of the disease, since the molecular mediators of the disease are linked with its etiopathogenesis. Thus the search for biomarkers of prostate cancer must recognize its etiology and downstream mediators. In this review, PCGEM1, a patented prostatespecific non-coding RNA gene with an upregulated transcription in African American malignancy will be discussed in relationship to the etiology of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: Evidence suggests that men diagnosed with prostate cancer live as long as or longer than those without a diagnosis. We postulate that a reason for this paradox is increased preventive and therapeutic health care interventions following a prostate cancer diagnosis. We explored this phenomenon in patients surgically treated for prostate cancer. Materials and methods: We examined the records of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at Audie L. Murphy Veterans Hospital between 2001 and 2004, focusing on cancer related and comorbidity data including new diagnoses, interventions and medications. Results: A total of 174 subjects had complete data for review. Of these men 72% had a change in medical regimen after diagnosis, 61% had a change in medication and 29% received a new medical diagnosis. Three men underwent cardiac catheterization and 1 had coronary bypass surgery. Conclusions: These data highlight the extent of evaluation and subsequent changes in medical treatment regimens that occur after a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Such interventions would be expected to affect survival outcomes of men recently diagnosed with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Background: The value of routine screening for prostate cancer remains unknown because of the lack of randomized studies. Until such studies are completed, a sensible approach to screening is needed. Methods: One approach is to use the method of decision analysis to model the outcome of alternative screening strategies. Conclusions: By assessing the results in terms of their effect on life expectancy and prostate cancer mortality, it may be possible to select the policy that has the greatest potential benefit for the least cost.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in men in developed countries. Once the tumor has achieved a castration-refractory metastatic stage, treatment options are limited with the average survival of patients ranging from two to three years only. Recently, new drugs for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have been approved, and others are in an advanced stage of clinical testing. In this review we provide an overview of the new therapeutic agents that arrived in the clinical praxis or are tested in clinical studies and their mode of action including hormone synthesis inhibitors, new androgen receptor blockers, bone targeting and antiangiogenic agents, endothelin receptor antagonists, growth factor inhibitors, novel radiotherapeutics and taxanes, and immunotherapeutic approaches. Results and limitations from clinical studies as well as future needs for improvement of CRPC treatments are critically discussed.",prostate cancer
"Imaging has played an important role in the administration of personalized medicine. From diagnosing diseases to guiding therapies, imaging has become an all-encompassing modality. With respect to prostate cancer, personalized management of the disease has been transformed by imaging. Specifically, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as a vital player in the detection, characterization, and localization of the disease thus making the incorporation of imaging in personalized prostate cancer management integral. In this review, the current role of imaging in personalized medicine for the management of prostate cancer is discussed.",prostate cancer
"Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with prostate cancer have altered clinical management of the disease. Although direct rectal examination remains the standard clinical tool for staging prostate cancer, transrectal ultrasound appears to be about twice as sensitive for detection. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has replaced prostate-specific acid phosphatase as a serum tumor marker for prostate cancer. When used in conjunction with measurement of prostate volume by transrectal ultrasound, PSA values may identify patients at increased risk for occult cancer. Use of transrectal ultrasound and PSA values has also improved the accuracy of clinical staging. Modifications in the technique of radical prostatectomy have minimized the morbidity associated with this procedure, making it a more attractive therapeutic option in patients with localized prostate cancer. In patients with metastatic disease, total androgen blockade is an option that appears superior to standard hormonal therapy.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer has become one of the most common malignancies in the world. The incidence of prostate cancer has rapidly increasing over the last decade in East Asia. In Japan, age-adjusted death rates due to prostate cancer rose from 4.4 to 8.6 per 100,000 between 1980 and 1998. Recent research has focused on age, race-related differences, patterns of familial aggregation, genetic factors, hormones, and diet. Epidemiological approach has identified several possible risk factors that may be useful for the prevention of prostate cancer and targeting high-risk individuals for early detection.",prostate cancer
"This review contrasts a traditional biomedical model with an outcomes model and illustrates the distinction in approaches with regards to prostate cancer. The traditional biomedical model emphasizes diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. The principal data are diagnosis and disease status. In contrast, an outcomes model emphasizes life expectancy and health-related quality of life. According to the traditional model, screening for prostate cancer is encouraged and focus is on the number of cases diagnosed and the success of treatment. Treatment success is measured by recurrence rates or disease-free survival; however, among all men with the potential for a diagnosis of prostate cancer, most will die of other causes. Treatment may have significant consequences in terms of quality of life without clear evidence that it improves survival. The outcomes model argues that decisions for screening and treatment of prostate cancer must be shared between an informed patient and his physician.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a public health problem of the elderly men. It has been estimated that one in six men will develop prostate cancer in his lifetime in the USA. There is thus a huge clinical demand for effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of the disease. Here, the scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of melatonin in inhibiting the development and progression of prostate cancer is reviewed. The rational use of melatonin in prostate cancer prevention, stabilization of clinically localized favourable-risk prostate cancer and palliative treatment of advanced or metastatic tumour is discussed within the context of the molecular pathogenesis of the disease.",prostate cancer
"The value of screening for prostate cancer has been a contentious issue within the medical literature for several decades. At the crux of the matter lies a judgment call of whether the potential benefits of screening, a reduction in prostate cancer and all-cause mortality, outweigh the limitations, overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The study by Schrφder et al. reports 9, 11 and 13-year follow-up data on men participating in the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer (ERSPC). While the authors report a significant reduction in prostate cancer mortality, they conclude that potential harms associated with screening currently circumvent any recommendation for a population-based approach to screening for prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and the fifth cause of cancer death in males. Currently, there are no effective therapies for prostate cancer yet, and the status of treatment remains severe. In this study, we analyzed the composition of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) in prostate cancer and paracancerous samples based on the gene expression profiles using CIBERSORT. Calculation of the TIIC subset proportions in 52 paired prostate cancer and paracancerous samples showed that their proportions were similar in intergroup and varied in intragroup. Compared with the paracancerous samples, the proportion of M0 macrophages was significantly increased in prostate cancer samples. Cox regression analysis using the TIIC subpopulations as continuous variables revealed that high plasma cell proportion was associated with poor 3-year Disease-Free Survival (DFS) in prostate cancer (hazard ratios = 1.8e-76, p = 0.001). Moreover, three immune clusters, which presented distinct prognosis, were identified using hierarchical clustering analysis based on the proportions of TIIC subpopulations. Among them, cluster 1 had superior 3-year DFS, while cluster 3 showed inferior 3-year DFS (p = 0.025). In summary, our research provided a comprehensive analysis on the TIIC composition in prostate cancer and suggested that both plasma cells and different cluster patterns were associated with the prostate cancer prognosis, which should be helpful for the clinical surveillance and treatment of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Similarly to earlier years, a vast majority of novel findings were published on prostate cancer, which is the most common urological cancer. Clinical trials with long-term follow-up and promising observational studies were published. In this paper the author reviews the relevant novelties including the diagnostic use of magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography/computed tomography as well as active surveillance, cytoreductive prostatectomy and medical treatment.",prostate cancer
"Objective: This study explores men with advanced prostate cancers' own practices for promoting and maintaining emotional well-being using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Design: Five men with advanced prostate cancer participated in face-to-face, semi-structured, in-depth interviews. Results: Within rich narratives of lost and regained well-being, two super-ordinate themes emerged--'living with an imminent and uncertain death' and 'holding on to life.' Well-being was threatened by reduced sense of the future, isolation and uncertainty. Yet, the men pursued well-being by managing their emotions, striving for the future whilst enjoying life in the present, taking care of their families and renegotiating purpose. Running through participant's accounts was a preference for taking action and problem-solving. Sense of purpose, social connectedness, and life engagement were revealed as concepts central to improving well-being, indicating areas which practitioners could explore with men to help them re-establish personal goals and life purpose. Conclusions: The findings also add weight to the evidence base for the potential value of psychological interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness in men with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Background: I review the data published during the last 5 years on the effects of early treatment of prostate cancer on survival. Methods: Data from prospective and randomized studies as well as from population-based studies are presented. Results: Two studies (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) in stage T3 disease have shown that long-term (3 years or indefinite, respectively) androgen blockade prolongs life in patients receiving androgen blockade in addition to radiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone. In the UK Medical Research Council study, androgen blockade at diagnosis of locally advanced or asymptomatic patients decreased cancer-specific death by 21% compared to delayed treatment. A 69% decrease in prostate cancer death was observed in the Quebec Randomized Prostate Cancer Screening Study. Population-based studies in Sweden and Denmark have shown that 62% and 63%, respectively, of patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer will die from the disease if not treated immediately. Decreases in prostate cancer death rate of 6.3-23% have been found between 1991-1997 in the US and Canada, respectively. Conclusions: Treatment of localized disease has been shown in all the available randomized studies to cause a marked decrease in prostate cancer death. Simple use of the available screening procedures and treatments for localized prostate cancer could cause a dramatic decrease in prostate cancer death.",prostate cancer
"It is a paradigm in cancer treatment that early detection and treatment improves survival. However, although screening measures lead to a higher rate of detection, for small bulk localised prostate cancer it remains unclear whether early detection and early treatment will lead to an overall decrease in mortality. The management options include surveillance, radiotherapy, and radical prostatectomy but there is no evidence base to evaluate the benefits of each approach. Advanced prostate cancer is managed by hormonal therapy. There have been major changes in treatment over the last two decades with the use of more humane treatment and developments in both chemotherapy and radiation. In this article we review the natural history and management of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer affecting men today. It largely affects men in the fifth and sixth decade of life. Screening for prostate cancer, though controversial, is still the only way to detect early prostate cancer. Multiple newer options such as blood tests and genetic markers are being used in the clinical domain today to improve cancer detection and avoid unnecessary biopsies. To date, biopsy of the prostate remains the only modality to stratify the grade of cancer. Significant improvements in the imaging technology have improved localizing and detecting the disease. Treatment of prostate cancer is stratified on the basis of the grade and volume of the disease. There are multiple treatment options involved in the management of prostate cancer. Treatment of localized prostate cancer still continues to have very high cure rates and long-term cancer-specific survival rates.",prostate cancer
"Background: It is challenging to decide in which way we should care for localized prostate cancer. The current guideline can be accepted as an appropriate foundation. However, there are doubts if guideline recommendations are implemented. Results: The presented opinion survey of prostate cancer support groups shows that we have too many prostatectomies in senior patients. It reveals deficiencies in the guidance of the patients. They are not sufficiently embedded in the process of decision-making. More attention should be paid to initiatives of patient support groups.",prostate cancer
"The purpose of this study was to explore young British men's understandings of prostate health and cancer of the prostate. A total of 16 White-British men between 31-50 years of age took part in interviews face-to-face or through computer-mediated communication. Thematic analysis broadly informed by grounded theory identified two key themes; 'limited knowledge about the prostate' and 'early detection & unpleasant procedures'. Accounts are discussed with reference to implications for improving men's understandings of prostate cancer, and likelihood of self-referral for prostate screening where necessary.",prostate cancer
"During the last four years approximately 400 men were evaluated in the early detection program for prostate cancer at The Ohio State University. Of these 400 men, 25 were found to have cancer. Eleven of the 25 had normal PSAs at the time cancer was diagnosed. The rise with a Hybritech assay, PSA of 1.2 ng/ml per year, one to two and subsequent years of greater than 1.2 ng/ml in this study indicates a higher likelihood of having a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Of the 25 patients who have been evaluated, only 4 patients had a subsequent drop of PSA from year one to two when the value dropped less than 0.6 ng/ml. Prostate intraepithelial neoplasia grade III has also been associated in these patients.",prostate cancer
"Objective: To investigate the prevalence of physical symptoms that were 'ever' and 'currently' experienced by survivors of prostate cancer at a population level, to assess burden and thus inform policy to support survivors. Patients and methods: The study included 3 348 men surviving prostate cancer for 2-18 years after diagnosis. A cross-sectional, postal survey of 6 559 survivors diagnosed 2-18 years ago with primary, invasive prostate cancer (ICD10-C61) identified via national, population-based cancer registries in Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland. Questions included symptoms at diagnosis, primary treatments and physical symptoms (erectile dysfunction [ED]/urinary incontinence [UI]/bowel problems/breast changes/loss of libido/hot flashes/fatigue) experienced 'ever' and at questionnaire completion ('current'). Symptom proportions were weighted by age, country and time since diagnosis. Bonferroni corrections were applied for multiple comparisons. Results: Adjusted response rate 54%; 75% reported at least one 'current' physical symptom ('ever' 90%), with 29% reporting at least three. Prevalence varied by treatment. Overall, 57% reported current ED and this was highest after radical prostatectomy (RP, 76%) followed by external beam radiotherapy with concurrent hormone therapy (HT, 64%). UI (overall 'current' 16%) was highest after RP ('current' 28%; 'ever' 70%). While 42% of brachytherapy patients reported no 'current' symptoms, 43% reported 'current' ED and 8% 'current' UI. 'Current' hot flashes (41%), breast changes (18%) and fatigue (28%) were reported more often by patients on HT. Conclusion: Symptoms after prostate cancer treatment are common, often multiple, persist long-term and vary by treatment method. They represent a significant health burden. An estimated 1.6% of men aged >45 years are survivors of prostate cancer and currently experiencing an adverse physical symptom. Recognition and treatment of physical symptoms should be prioritised in patient follow-up. This information should facilitate men and clinicians when deciding about treatment as differences in survival between radical treatments is minimal.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: The purpose of this review is to examine prostate cancer racial disparities specific to the African-American population. Recent findings: African-American men are more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, present at an earlier age; are more likely to have locally advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis; and have suboptimal outcomes to standard treatments. Prostate cancer treatment requires a nuanced approach, particularly when applying screening, counseling, and management of African-American men. Oncological as well as functional outcomes may differ and are potentially due to a combination of genetic, molecular, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors.",prostate cancer
"Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated anticancer action of polyphenolic plant metabolites. However, data about associations between dietary intake of plant-derived flavonoids and prostate cancer risk are still sparse and inconsistent. This minireview compiles the epidemiological findings published to date on the role of flavonoids in prostate tumorigenesis, discusses the reasons of inconsistencies and elicits the promising results for chemoprevention of this malignancy. Long-term consumption of high doses of soy isoflavones can be the reason of markedly lower clinically detectable prostate cancer incidence among Asian men compared to their counterparts in the Western world. The ability to metabolize daidzein to equol, the most biologically active isoflavone, by the certain intestinal bacteria also seems to contribute to this important health benefit. The increasing incidence rate of prostate cancer related to adoption of westernized lifestyle and dietary habits makes the issue of chemoprevention ever more important and directs the eyes to specific food components in the Eastern diet. If further large-scale epidemiological studies will confirm the protective effects of isoflavones against prostate cancer, this could provide an important way for prostate cancer prevention, as diet is a potentially modifiable factor in our behavioral pattern.",prostate cancer
"Despite recent advances, current diagnostic tests and treatment of prostate cancer have limitations. In the last few years, numerous biomolecules have been investigated with the aim of improving diagnosis, including kallikrein-like proteases, growth factors and neuroendocrine markers. Analysis of susceptibility genes has also been a focus of attention. Extensive research into new therapeutic approaches is also underway, including targeting angiogenesis, immune regulation and stromal-epithelial interactions. Gene therapy, gene chip technology and proteomics have emerged as promising innovations. The host of novel diagnostic markers and therapies require appropriate validation, both phenotypical and functional. A further consideration is the need to re-evaluate clinical trial design and end points to facilitate progression of promising targets through the clinical trial process. Overall, the outlook for the treatment of prostate cancer looks promising, with any advances likely to require both a multimodal and multidisciplinary approach.",prostate cancer

"Purpose of review: The goal of this article is to discuss current genomic testing options in localized prostate cancer. Recent findings: There are multiple genomic tests currently available for men with localized prostate cancer. Prolaris, OncotypeDx, and Decipher can all be tested using biopsy tissue. Prolaris and Decipher are also available for men undergoing radical prostatectomy to predict subsequent disease progression. Summary: The Prolaris cell cycle progression score measured on biopsy predicts the risk of prostate cancer death in 10 years with conservative management, whereas, the primary endpoint for the OncotypeDx genomic prostate score is the risk of adverse disease at radical prostatectomy. Decipher measures genome-wide RNA expression, and its Genomic Classifier signature was initially designed to predict the risk of metastasis for men with adverse disease at radical prostatectomy, and more recently, a biopsy version was released. Recently, Decipher signatures predicting prostate cancer cell lineage and postoperative radiation sensitivity have also been described. Any of these tests can be used by men with localized prostate cancer to provide additional prognostic risk stratification to aid in treatment decisions.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is becoming the most common cancer in men. In parallel, role of diet as contributing or protector factor of prostate cancer is supported by experimental studies, clinical observations and intervention studies. Among the prostate cancer risk factor, role of energy intake, especially saturated fat, has been demonstrated. Similarly, omega-3, lycopene, pomegranate juice and vitamin D protective role have been shown. Informed and educated population is necessary to limit energy intake and promote consumption of foods potentially protective.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer (PC) is a common malignancy among elderly males and is noncurable once it becomes metastatic. In recent years, a number of antigen-delivery systems have emerged as viable and promising immunotherapeutic agents against PC. The approval of sipuleucel-T by the US FDA for the treatment of males with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic castrate resistant PC was a landmark in cancer immunotherapy, making this the first approved immunotherapeutic. A number of vaccines are under clinical investigation, each having its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here, we discuss the basic technologies underlying these different delivery modes, we discuss the completed and current human clinical trials, as well as the use of vaccines in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.",prostate cancer
"In Japan, where the mortality rate of prostate cancer is lower than in Western countries, radical prostatectomy or hormonal therapy has been applied more frequently than radiation therapy. However, the number of patients with prostate cancer has been increasing recently and the importance of radiation therapy has rapidly been recognized. Although there have been no randomized trials, results from several institutions in Western countries suggest that similar results of cancer control are achieved with either radiation therapy or radical prostatectomy. For higher-risk cases, conformal high-dose therapy or adjuvant hormonal therapy is more appropriate. In this article, the results of radiation therapy for prostate cancer were reviewed, with a view to the appropriate choice of therapy in Japan.",prostate cancer
"The landscape of treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has rapidly evolved during the last 5 years alone. In this review, standard therapies as well as recent advances in the systemic treatment for prostate cancer are explored. Pivotal trial data are summarized with emphasis on indications for various anti-androgen drugs, androgen-biosynthesis inhibitors, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and bone-targeted agents. The clinical, biochemical and radiographic outcomes for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer are improving with the establishment of several promising novel agents.",prostate cancer
"Surgical therapy is not only a therapeutic method but also an important procedure to provide useful information in determining a postoperative treatment strategy. Compared with postoperative cancer staging based on specimens obtained during surgery, more than 30% of cancers were inaccurately staged preoperatively, even when a current advanced diagnostic imaging technique was used. Compared with postoperative histological 30-40% of cancer staging were inaccurately staged based on a preoperative biopsy. These misstaging cases pose a significantly important problem. Approximately 15% and 30% of clinical stage C prostate cancers have been rated as pT2 and pN(+), respectively. Patients with pT3 prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy had 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates of 82% and 67%, respectively, which were comparable to those in patients with pT2 prostate cancer (82% and 67%, respectively). However, patients with prostate cancer rated as pT4 and pN(+) had very poor outcomes with 5-year overall survival rates of 42.4% and 32.6%, respectively. Therefore, even in patients with stage C prostate cancer, surgical therapy should be recommended if no infiltration of adjacent tissue has been noted and the operation is applicable; and an optimal postoperative therapeutic strategy should be selected based on the accurate pathological staging and histological grading using postoperative pathological specimens. Such approaches will prevent unnecessary hormone therapy in patients with pT2 prostate cancer and prevent missing optimal timing for radical cure, as well as allowing appropriate therapy to be selected for patients with pT4 and pN(+) prostate cancer, for whom prognosis may be poor.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer was a neglected area in psycho-oncology. There is now a growing number of studies on the psychosocial aspects of having prostate cancer and the possibilities to reduce these problems in educational and group interventions. In this issue of Patient Education and Counseling, studies are presented on several psychosocial and educational aspects in prostate cancer patients: screening events and outcomes, assessing the unmet information, support and care delivery needs, reacting to the diagnosis of prostate cancer, informational needs of men on hormonal therapy, changes in health-related quality of life three months after the diagnosis, information-seeking behaviors and information needs of partners, quality of leaflets, video information in decision making, and patient perceptions and priorities in a rehabilitation program. Conclusions are presented on neglected research areas in psychosocial and educational aspects of living with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The field of prostate cancer has witnessed incredible progress in the last decade, owing to the approval of multiple survival-prolonging treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Enzalutamide is a nonsteroidal androgen receptor inhibitor that targets multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling axis. It has been approved for the treatment of mCRPC both in the postdocetaxel and in the chemotherapy-naive settings. We summarize the milestones in the development of enzalutamide in patients with prostate cancer. Special focus is placed on the results of the STRIVE Phase II clinical trial comparing head to head enzalutamide and bicalutamide in patients with nonmetastatic and mCRPC who have failed androgen deprivation and in other ongoing trials in the same setting and in earlier disease phases.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer remains a common cause of cancer death in men. Applications of new genomic technologies to the recent development of high-quality prostate cancer models in multiple contexts have added great molecular insight into the development of and progression to metastasis. Genomic analysis of DNA, RNA, and protein alterations allows for the global assessment of this disease and provides the molecular framework to improve risk classification, outcome prediction, and development of targeted therapies. The creation of expression profiles and signatures will allow the evaluation of cancer phenotypes and give insight into determining those with increased risk of cancer, identification of critical pathways involved in the development of cancer, prediction of disease outcome, and assessment of the response of cancer to established and novel therapies. This review focuses on highlighting recent work in genomics and on its role in evaluating potential genetic modifiers of prostate cancer and novel biomarkers that may help with prostate cancer diagnosis, its potential to provide a better understanding of prostate cancer behavior and transition to metastatic disease, and its role in current and new therapies in prostate cancer. This framework has the exciting potential to be predictive and provide personalized and individual treatment to the large number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer each year.",prostate cancer
"Background: The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) was conducted in sites around USA during a period of marked secular changes in the use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer. Material and methods: Trends in prostate cancer incidence, stage at presentation and mortality are useful when interpreting the results from a screening trial that commenced in 1993 and enrolled participants through 2001. The last participants completed active screening in 2006. Incidence and mortality data published to date on PLCO need to be placed into the context of the secular trends. Additional data analyses have been conducted on subsets of the participants and these results can also enhance the interpretation of the trial. Additionally, the accompanying biospecimen repository has served as a rich research resource yielding informative findings. Results: The PLCO is best viewed as a trial comparing a regimented active annual screening program of PSA screening for six rounds, four of which had accompanying digital rectal examination (DRE) to patterns of screening that were occurring in the population in many academic and community settings across the USA. The epidemiology and molecular genetics of prostate cancer is becoming better understood and analyses of the PLCO resource have contributed. One approach to risk assessment utilizing genetic markers from selected members of the PLCO prostate cancer cohort has been developed. A modeling effort with CISNET-ERSPC-PLCO is underway to compare and contrast findings such as effects of different PSA thresholds and screening intervals. Conclusions: The information emerging from PLCO is useful to inform the debate around prostate cancer screening. An understanding of the biologic differences underpinning indolent and aggressive prostate cancer will better guide the future development of screening and treatment strategies.",prostate cancer
"Thousands of men will be faced with a diagnosis of prostate cancer this year and will turn to their primary care physician for advice about which treatment is best. Unfortunately, there are no easy answers, and multiple factors, including the patient's age, must be weighed in decision making. In this article, Drs Williams and Love sift through the pros and cons of the available treatment options for various profiles of organ-confined disease.",prostate cancer
"Mortality from prostate cancer is two to three times greater among African-American men between the ages of 50 and 70 than among American Caucasian men of similar ages. Also, African-Americans tend to present with more advanced tumors than their American Caucasian counterparts. This article explores differences between the two races that may account for the disproportionately high mortality among African-Americans and their more advanced disease stage at presentation. These include epidemiologic and histologic features of prostate cancer; clinical, biologic, and environmental factors; and barriers to health care. Various important issues that warrant further investigation are also highlighted.",prostate cancer
"Patients with an elevated serum total prostate-specific antigen value or abnormal digital rectal examination results are at risk of having prostate cancer and should undergo prostate needle biopsies. However, approximately 60% of them will have a negative prostate biopsy result. Therefore, further biopsies are recommended for young patients at risk of prostate cancer with a positive rate of 20-40%. Biomarkers are required in order to avoid unnecessary biopsies. The PCA3 gene product is specifically overexpressed in prostate tumor cells, and modern molecular biology techniques allow us to use a specific test for this gene in order to select patients who have a high risk of having prostate cancer. Literature reviews of the gene product, as well as the first clinical results of the Progensa PCA3 test, are presented.",prostate cancer
"This article presents an overview of the challenges that men encounter in making decisions about prostate cancer screening, including complex affective and cognitive factors and controversies in the interpretation of the evidence on prostate cancer screening. Shared decision making involving patient decision aids are discussed as approaches that can be used to improve the quality of prostate cancer screening decisions, including a close alignment between a man's values, goals, and preferences and his choice about screening.",prostate cancer
"Widespread implementation of prostate cancer screening has affected several epidemiologic features of the disease including incidence, tumor and patient characteristics, patterns of care and outcomes. Some of these changes have been interpreted as evidence of the success of PSA testing as a cancer control strategy. Data are available from multiple sources to assess the association of early detection on recent prostate cancer rates and trends. National mortality data in the United States may be particularly informative because of the early and widespread adoption of PSA testing there. Incidence data from tumor registries and other regional resources are also relevant to this question. Case-control analyses and modeling of relevant rates and trends have recently been reported. Multiple sources of data show that prostate cancer incidence rates rose following the introduction of PSA testing. The average age at diagnosis has fallen, the proportion of advanced stage tumors has declined, the proportion of moderately differentiated tumors has increased, and patterns of care have changed accordingly. A decline in mortality began in the United States in 1991. The decline in mortality is well established but this recent trend may only retrace an increase in mortality that immediately preceded. The descriptive epidemiology of prostate cancer reveals many effects of the introduction of prostate cancer screening. Although the evidence suggests increased prostate cancer testing has yielded public health benefit, this has not yet been shown conclusively.",prostate cancer
"Monitoring disease progression through imaging is playing an increasingly important role in the treatment of prostate cancer. Here, we report that primary mouse prostate cancer cell lines stably expressing luciferase and tumor biomarkers can be monitored through bioluminescence imaging along with assays of serum biomarkers and immune function. Tumorigenesis in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice can be monitored in by collecting samples from the dorsal flank, dorsolateral prostate, and tail vein to obtain real-time subcutaneous, orthotopic, and metastasis indicators, respectively. We used this technique to confirm the therapeutic effect of immune checkpoint blockade. Our findings suggest the presented indicators are ideally suited for real-time tracking of drug responses, tumor progression and immune function.",prostate cancer
"The natural history of clinically localized prostate cancer is controversial. However, the data that is available suggests outcomes are good for men with well and moderately differentiated disease, but relatively poor for men with poorly differentiated cancer. For example, in one synthesis of individual-patient level data from six series, ten-year prostate cancer-specific mortality for men with well, moderate, and poorly differentiated disease was estimated at 13%, 13%, and 66%, respectively. Tumor grade is the dominant predictor of prognosis. Few studies report on risks of morbidity due to local cancer progression; the data available suggest this risk is relatively low. Cancer-specific mortality figures overestimate the impact of disease among older men with competing causes of mortality. Given the available data on prognosis of men with localized prostate cancer not treated for cure, clinical trials designed to measure the effectiveness of aggressive therapy will need to be large.",prostate cancer
"The etiology of prostate cancer remains virtually unknown. Although there are a number of new leads with regard to risk factors for prostate cancer, more research is required to confirm them. There is little purpose in conducting further case-control studies of prostate cancer-particularly since the use of PSA testing has become wide-spread. Instead, future epidemiologic studies should focus on prostate tumor subclassification, in terms of method of detection, markers of biological ""aggressiveness,"" and genetic changes. Many of these new leads involve the possible influence of polymorphisms in key genes involved in important physiologic processes in the prostate. To fully explore the complexity of interrelationships between the several elements in these pathways will require large cohort studies in which blood is sampled prior to diagnosis. Such studies will be important for identifying which modifiable aspects of lifestyle (such as diet, alcohol, tobacco, physical activity) might be targeted for intervention, to reduce risk. The detection of early prostate cancers by PSA testing relatives of men with prostate cancer has affected the prevalence of phenocopies and, hence, the meaningfulness of risk estimation in prostate cancer families. Because multiple-case families form the substrate for gene hunting via linkage analysis, this phenocopy phenomenon is going to cause considerable confusion and wasted effort. Presently, men with a family history of prostate cancer can be provided with little advice in terms of preventive action. It is likely that one or more genetic mutations associated with a high risk for prostate cancer will be identified in the near future. Even so, the risks probably will be similar to those for mutations in the first two breast cancer genes--informative for very few families. It is difficult to foresee, as and when high-risk mutation carriers are identified, what advice should be offered to them: prophylactic prostatectomies seem to have less attraction than do prophylactic mastectomies for women at high risk of breast cancer. This issue becomes more complex when considering counseling on the basis of a genetic profile involving many low-risk polymorphisms. Hopefully, such genetic screening should occur only after its efficacy has been established; when there is a better understanding of prostate biology, tumor heterogeneity, and prognosis; and when there are proven treatment or prevention options available. Prevention is held to be better than cure, and there are some potentially interesting chemopreventive agents that require careful trial before public health initiatives can be promoted. Potential candidates include vitamin E, selenium, zinc, and lycopene as dietary supplements. There are other agents that may be appropriate for pharmaceutical development, including inhibitors of COX-2 and IGF-1 activity. It is important that chemoprevention trials are followed-up for a sufficient period of time and that other endpoints also are captured, because the supplementation of diets with superphysiologic doses of individual micronutrients sometimes has caused unexpected and unwanted results--for example, an 18% increase in lung cancers observed in the beta-carotene arm of the ATBC trial.",prostate cancer
"Family studies of prostate cancer, in keeping with studies of many other common cancers, have shown an increased risk to relatives of cases over and above the general population. Male relatives of early onset prostate cancer cases are also at increased risk over relatives of later onset cases. These observations, together with a few families with four or more cases of prostate cancer, suggest that there is a high penetrance, inherited form of this cancer. Further evidence comes from the increased risk of prostate cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers but more particularly from the recent report of the mapping of a prostate cancer susceptibility gene to chromosome 1.",prostate cancer
"The vasculature plays an important role in the normal and malignant prostate. Under basal conditions both glandular epithelial and stromal prostate cells produce an abundance of blood flow and angiogenesis regulating substances and the expression of these is generally increased in prostate tumors. The proportion of proliferating endothelial cells is high in the normal prostate compared to other tissues in the body. After castration effects on the vasculature, such as decreased blood flow and vascular regression, precede effects on the glandular compartment. Correspondingly, hormone induced prostate growth is characterized by early effects on the vasculature such as increased blood flow and endothelial cell proliferation, thus indicating that the vasculature may be involved in the androgenic regulation of the prostate. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and prostate cancer are associated with increased vascular density and in experimental models prostate cancer growth is apparently angiogenesis-dependent since tumor growth and progression can be inhibited by antiangiogenic treatment. Moreover, vascular density has been related to prognosis in prostate cancer patients. A better understanding of the pathways regulating angiogenesis in the normal prostate and how these pathways change during malignant transformation can hopefully lead to better prognostic markers and therapies for the large group of patients with prostate cancer. The purpose of this review is therefore to summarize the current knowledge on the role and regulation of the vasculature in the prostate and its potential clinical applications.",prostate cancer
"In soils and surface waters in the Sumy region increased content of heavy metals (copper, manganese, iron, chromium, lead and zinc) according to Novomoskovskaya geological expedition (1991) and the report of the State Administration of Environmental Protection in the Sumy region ""On state of the environment in the Sumy region "" for 2012. Therefore, in this region is extremely important to study the possible impact of adverse environmental factors on the occurrence of pathological processes, especially cancer in the population. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible factors influencing the prostate cancer morbidity among the general population in different areas of Sumy region. Screening analysis of prostate cancer morbidity among the population of Sumy region was conducted and the data of the Sumy Regional Oncology Center on the prevalence of cancer among the population of the Sumy region in the last 10 years were studied. The environmental situation of the Sumy region in recent years was studied; areas with the highest pollution of surface waters and soils were identified. Comparison of pollution of Sumy regions and prostate cancer morbidity were conducted The study of the ecological situation in Sumy region and analysis of the level of environmental pollution in some areas showed that the highest incidence of prostate cancer observed in areas with poor ecological state of water resources and soil. Significant fluctuations in the level of breast cancer morbidity in different areas of Sumy region were also found. The study showed that the incidence of prostate cancer among the population of Sumy region associated with adverse environmental factors.",prostate cancer
"One of the delicate problems in a cancer treatment is the acquisition of a tolerance for a medicine. Antiandrogen treatment is valid in treatment of prostate cancer, but the disease develops into hormone-refractory prostate cancer after a uniformity period. The molecular mechanisms of recurrence and endocrine therapy failure in prostate cancer have remained unclear. In this paper we discuss the hormone-refractory prostate cancer that has been reported by many investigators.",prostate cancer
"The course of untreated localized prostate cancer after 10 years of follow-up is at large unknown. As curative treatment is usually only offered patients with a life expectancy exceeding 10 Years, the expected course of the disease if left untreated is of the utmost interest. This paper aims to describe the outcome for patients who survive for more than 10 years when treated without curative intent. The results indicate that cancer specific mortality in patients with localized prostate cancer increases steadily over time and is approximately 50% after 15 years. This is a much higher figure than in reported series on radical prostatectomy. Even if many deaths occur at an old age, prostate cancer death is shown to be associated with a significant morbidity, need for palliative treatment, hospital care and cost. Preventing prostate cancer death is therefore not only a matter of saving year of life but also to prevent suffering caused by the disease. Modern diagnostic tools, such as prostate specific antigen, seem to detect clinically significant cancers in the vast majority of patients. Over diagnosis seems to be uncommon if diagnostic procedures are restricted to patients with a long life expectancy. Localized prostate cancer is a slow-growing but progressive neoplastic disease. When diagnosed in a man with a longer life expectancy it should be handled as such.",prostate cancer

"Aim: Research suggests that anxiety may be a common response to a cancer diagnosis, but research is needed to examine anxiety before diagnosis. Anxiety before diagnosis may relate to the comprehension of relevant health information or openness to potential treatments. This study examined anxiety and these outcomes in men who were waiting to learn of a prostate cancer diagnosis. Objectives: One goal of this study was to determine whether anxiety would increase as men came closer to learning the results of their prostate cancer biopsy. Another goal was to test whether anxiety was associated with knowledge about prostate cancer or openness to different treatments. Methods: Men (N = 265) who were facing a prostate cancer diagnosis were surveyed at two time points. Time 1 occurred at the time of biopsy, and Time 2 occurred immediately before men received their biopsy result. At each time point, men reported their anxiety about prostate cancer and their biopsy result. At Time 2, they completed a knowledge test of information about prostate cancer and reported their openness to different potential treatments. Results: Anxiety symptoms increased as men came closer to learning their diagnosis. Also, higher anxiety was associated with lower knowledge and greater openness to particular treatments like surgery. Interactions showed that when anxiety increased from Time 1 to Time 2, having high or low knowledge mattered less to treatment openness. Conclusion: Waiting for a cancer diagnosis is an important time period in which anxiety may increase and relate to information processing and openness to treatments. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Men undergoing prostate cancer screening have been found to experience high and low levels of anxiety. Research has shown that negative emotions like anxiety are common following a cancer diagnosis, but little research has examined emotions right before diagnosis. Anxiety has been associated with information processing and motivation to engage in preventive behaviours. What does this study add? Applies and tests a theoretical idea related to how anxiety may change as one approaches personally relevant threatening health feedback. Shows relationships between changes in anxiety and knowledge in the context of waiting for actual health feedback. Associates increased anxiety in the prostate cancer context with knowledge and openness to different treatments.",prostate cancer
"The present paper gives a comprehensive overview of recent data, especially prospective randomized trials, which support an important role for nutrition in the development of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer seems to be an ideal candidate for chemoprevention, in order to interfere by modification of nutritional habits with its onset, its incidence and ultimately with its progression, especially in high risk groups.",prostate cancer
"It is now well established that cancer cells exhibit a number of genetic defects in the machinery that governs programmed cell death and that sabotage of apoptosis is one of the principal factors aiding in the evolution of the carcinogenic phenotype. A number of studies have implicated aberrant DNA methylation as a key survival mechanism in cancer, whereby promoter hypermethylation silences genes essential for many processes including apoptosis. To date, studies on the methylation profile of apoptotic genes have largely focused on cancers of the breast, colon and stomach, with only limited data available on prostate cancer. Here we discuss the major developments in the field of DNA methylation and its role in the regulation of aberrant apoptosis in prostate cancer. The most significant advances have involved the discovery of apoptotic gene targets of methylation, including XAF1, (fragile histidine triad (FHIT ), cellular retinol binding protein 1 (CRBP1), decoy receptor 1(DCR1), decoy receptor 2 (DCR2 ), target of methylation-induced silenceing 1 (TMS1), TNF receptor superfamily, member 6 (FAS), Reprimo (RPRM) and GLI pathogenesis-related 1 (GLIPR1). These genes are reported to be hypermethylated in prostate cancer and some offer potential as diagnostic and prognostic markers. We also introduce the concept of an 'apoptotic methylation signature' for prostate cancer and evaluate its potential in a diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic setting.",prostate cancer
"Men with non-metastatic prostate cancer have many treatment options. For over 35 years, radiation therapy has been a mainstay of treatment for this disease. With improvements in technology and better use of pretreatment prognostic factors, such as prostate specific antigen level and Gleason score, biochemical and clinical results have steadily improved. This article reviews the current status of radiation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer. Results of treatment utilizing three-dimensional conformal and conventional techniques are compared and contrasted. The appropriate use of adjuvant hormones and particle beam therapy in the management of this disease is also discussed. Finally, the toxicity and future directions of radiation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer are addressed.",prostate cancer
"In many countries of the world, prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer in men, and in the United States it is now in first rank. It is an important public health problem, with > 0.25 million new cases diagnosed worldwide in the year 1985. Whereas earlier large increases in the incidence of prostate cancer were apparent throughout the world, the mortality rate has remained constant in generations of men born since the early years of this century. Most importantly, given that in several countries the increased number of children born after World War II will be in their mid-50s in the early part of the 21st century (at an age when cancer risk is becoming an important consideration), and coupled with the trends in increasing life expectancy, the consequence will be an increase in absolute terms in the number of cases of prostate cancer diagnosed. In the absence of treatment improvements and with prospects for prevention by modification of lifestyle remote within current knowledge, there will also be an increase in the number of deaths from prostate cancer worldwide. The situation would be further augmented by the presence of a temporal trend in risk that is widely reported from many countries and unlikely to be entirely artefact.",prostate cancer
"The incidence of prostate cancer in the Japanese population has increased because of the increase in life expectancy, consumption of westernized diets, and improvements in prostate cancer screening by using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)test. Further, in the past 10 years, there have been great advancements in the treatment options available for prostate cancer. Radical treatment methods, such as robot-assisted surgery, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, and particle beam radiation therapy, may have anticancer effects and may improve the quality of life by preserving micturition ability and sexual function. Radiotherapy and endocrine therapy have been shown to prevent postoperative recurrence. Endocrine therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing recurrence after radiotherapy. Moreover, endocrine therapy can be administered to patients at all stages of prostate cancer and is often used as the initial treatment for advanced prostate cancer, particularly in patients with metastasis. However, recurrence(relapse)after endocrine therapy is associated with a poor prognosis. In this study, we describe all the available treatment options for prostate cancer and the treatable and untreatable forms of recurrent prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a prevalent disorder among men with a heterogeneous etiological background. Several molecular events and signaling perturbations have been found in this disorder. Among genes whose expressions have been altered during the prostate cancer development are cancer-testis antigens (CTAs). This group of antigens has limited expression in the normal adult tissues but aberrant expression in cancers. This property provides them the possibility to be used as cancer biomarkers and immunotherapeutic targets. Several CTAs have been shown to be immunogenic in prostate cancer patients and some of the have entered clinical trials. Based on the preliminary data obtained from these trials, it is expected that CTA-based therapeutic options are beneficial for at least a subset of prostate cancer patients.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common urologic neoplasm and the second leading cause of cancer-related death among men in many developed countries. Given the highly heterogeneous behaviour of the disease, there is a great need for prognostic factors, in order to stratify the clinical risk and give the best treatment options to the patient. Clinical factors, such as prostate-specific antigen value and derivatives, and pathological factors, such as stage and Gleason grading, are well kown prognostic factors. Nomograms can provide useful prediction in each clinical sceario. The field of molecular biomarkers is briskly evolving towards personalized medicine. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, deletion of PTEN ed and gene panels are some of the more extensively explored molecular features in prostate cancer outcome prediction. In the near future, circulating tumour cells, exosomes and microRNAs could give us further, not invasive important tools.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: Several studies have examined the association between polyunsaturated fatty acids and prostate cancer risk. We evaluated the evidence on the association between the essential polyunsaturated fatty acid, known as alpha-linolenic acid, and the risk of prostate cancer in humans. Materials and methods: We comprehensively reviewed published studies on the association between alpha-linolenic acid and the risk of prostate cancer using MEDLINE. Results: A number of studies have shown a positive association between dietary, plasma or red blood cell levels of alpha-linolenic acid and prostate cancer. Other studies have demonstrated either no association or a negative association. The limitations of these studies include the assumption that dietary or plasma alpha-linolenic acid levels are positively associated with prostate tissue alpha-linolenic acid levels, and measurement errors of dietary, plasma and red blood cell alpha-linolenic acid levels. Conclusions: More research is needed in this area before it can be concluded that there is an association between alpha-linolenic acid and prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The discovery of androgen dependence in prostate cancer in 1941 by Huggins and colleagues has remained the backbone for the treatment of this disease. However, although many patients initially respond to androgen depletion therapy, they almost invariably relapse and develop resistance with transition of the disease to a castration-resistant state. Over the past decade, the better understanding of the mechanisms that drive resistance to castration has led to the development of next-generation androgen receptor targeting agents such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide. This Review aims to revisit the discovery and evolution of androgen receptor targeting therapeutics for the treatment of advanced-stage prostate cancer over the years and to discuss the upcoming future and challenges in the treatment of this common cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cause of malignancy in males and the third leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. The standard care for primary PCa with local invasive disease mainly is surgery and radiation. For patients with distant metastases, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a gold standard. Regardless of a favorable outcome of ADT, patients inevitably relapse to an end-stage castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) leading to mortality. Therefore, revealing the mechanism and identifying cellular components driving aggressive PCa is critical for prognosis and therapeutic intervention. Cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotypes characterized as poor differentiation, cancer initiation with self-renewal capabilities, and therapeutic resistance are proposed to contribute to the onset of CRPC. In this review, we discuss the role of CSC in CRPC with the evidence of CSC phenotypes and the possible underlying mechanisms.",prostate cancer
"Objectives: To explore links between access to care and quality of life for underserved men with prostate cancer through a literature review. Data sources: Articles published from 2000 to present based on a PubMed search using the key words access, quality of life, health care access, underserved, low-income, health literacy, and prostate cancer. Conclusion: There is not one reason that adequately explains factors affecting access, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), or the potential relationships between the two for underserved men with prostate cancer. Socioeconomic factors contribute to accessibility and HRQOL, but not consistently, suggesting that there is still much work to be done in identifying factors and relationships that connect access to care and HRQOL for underserved men with prostate cancer. Implications for nursing practice: Particularly important is to develop intervention strategies to address the disparities in access to care and prostate cancer treatment outcomes (including HRQOL) for this vulnerable population. Based on findings from studies, nurses need to be actively involved in the development and implementation of programs that address multiple barriers including socioeconomic status, minority status, health literacy, insurance, and language.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a complex heterogeneous disease, and risk stratification remains a significant clinical challenge. Gene microarray has been developed to provide better prediction of clinical outcomes and potentially improve management of patients with various malignancies, including prostate cancer. Currently, several studies are evaluating the clinical significance of gene expression signatures in prostate cancer. These approaches might provide outcome predictions, such as treatment response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and metastatic status and offer new strategies to identify patients at high risk for personalized cancer therapies. This article discusses the latest developments in gene expression-based signatures that predict clinical behavior of prostate cancer. Gene profiling could lead to enhanced early detection and prognosis of prostate cancer, resulting in improved overall survival. The ability to predict clinical outcomes by the microarray-derived genetic signatures is promising; however, further studies are warranted to optimize its clinical utility in patients with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"In 2011, 11,428 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in the Netherlands and 2,500 men died from the disease. Since the introduction of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurements, few men have metastatic disease at the time diagnosis. More than half of prostate cancer patients are currently being diagnosed with low-volume localised prostate cancer. This raises the question whether all of these men should be treated, especially when prostate cancer-specific mortality is low compared to overall mortality even in men without known comorbidity at the time of diagnosis. In recent series of such 'healthy' men treated for localised prostate cancer, the overall mortality exceeded prostate cancer mortality four to five-fold. Both tumour-related factors and general health status affect the outcome of prostate cancer treatment. In 'healthy' men with a low-volume, low-risk tumour, initial active surveillance is preferred above actual treatment. The small chance of progression and the possibility of curative treatment at the time of progression should be communicated to the patient. In men with an intermediate- or high-risk tumour, active treatment is preferred and depends on age and life expectancy.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: This review provides an update on research into the association between obesity and prostate cancer. Recent findings: The US Health Professional Study reported an inverse relationship between risk for prostate cancer and obesity in men under the age of 60 or in those with a positive family history for prostate cancer. Others found no association between obesity and risk for the disease. Regarding detection, obesity does not impact upon measurement of prostate specific antigen as a method of detecting prostate cancer; however, in a referral population there was an inverse association between detection rate and obesity. In three radical prostatectomy series, obesity was associated with worse pathological features and higher biochemical relapse rates. Possible mechanisms for the association between obesity and prostate cancer include the impact on serum testosterone, leptin, insulin-like growth factor I, and interleukin-6 levels. Summary: A growing body of evidence suggests that obesity may impact upon risk, detection and outcome with regard to prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Androgens are critical drivers of prostate cancer. In this chapter we first discuss the canonical pathways of androgen metabolism and their alterations in prostate cancer progression, including the classical, backdoor and 5α-dione pathways, the role of pre-receptor DHT metabolism, and recent findings on oncogenic splicing of steroidogenic enzymes. Next, we discuss the activity and metabolism of non-canonical 11-oxygenated androgens that can activate wild-type AR and are less susceptible to glucuronidation and inactivation than the canonical androgens, thereby serving as an under-recognized reservoir of active ligands. We then discuss an emerging literature on the potential non-canonical role of androgen metabolizing enzymes in driving prostate cancer. We conclude by discussing the potential implications of these findings for prostate cancer progression, particularly in context of new agents such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, which target the AR-axis for prostate cancer therapy, including mechanisms of response and resistance and implications of these findings for future therapy.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in man and the second most common cause of death. The disease is uniquely heterogeneous, and includes tumors with moderate or full differentiation that could progress rather slowly, and tumors with poor differentiation that could have a rapid growth and extensive spread beyond the confines of the prostate. In the latter group of patients, and if they are not treated, the cancer becomes incurable and the long-term survival is compromised. The commonly accepted strategy among urologists at present is aimed at early detection of prostate cancer in order to provide curative local therapy. The recognition of prostate specific antigen (PSA) as a serum marker specific for prostate cancer has made this strategy possible. We herein provide an overview on the contemporary diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer, with emphasis on the role of prostate PSA. We also discuss the therapeutic options for localized disease.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. A variety of treatment options is available for localized prostate cancer and may range from active surveillance to focal therapy or whole gland treatment, that is, surgery or radiotherapy. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels are an important tool to monitor treatment success after whole gland treatment, unfortunately prostate-specific antigen is unreliable after focal therapy. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate is rapidly gaining field in the management of prostate cancer and may play a crucial role in the evaluation of recurrent prostate cancer. This article will focus on postprocedural magnetic resonance imaging after different forms of local therapy in patients with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Androgen receptor (AR) is the main target for prostate cancer therapy. Clinical approaches for AR inactivation include chemical castration, inhibition of androgen synthesis and AR antagonists (anti-androgens). However, treatment resistance occurs for which an important number of therapy escape mechanisms have been identified. Herein, we summarise the current knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying therapy resistance in prostate cancer. Moreover, the tumour escape mechanisms are arranged into the concepts of target modification, bypass signalling, histologic transformation, cancer stem cells and miscellaneous mechanisms. This may help researchers to compare and understand same or similar concepts of therapy resistance in prostate cancer and other cancer types.",prostate cancer
"Objectives: We aimed to compare the presenting features and management of prostate cancer among different racial groups. Patients and methods: We studied all patients diagnosed with prostate cancer at the Urological Oncology Clinic, Tygerberg Hospital, from January 1995 to December 2005. Most presented symptomatically as PSA screening is not readily available in the referral area of the hospital. Race was self-defined as white, coloured or black. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test or Fisher's exact test, where appropriate. A two-tailed p-value <0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Results: There were 901 patients: 291 (32.3%) white, 539 (59.8%) coloured and 71 (7.9%) black. Mean age at presentation was significantly higher in the white than the coloured and black groups (69.7, 67.9 and 68.9 years, respectively). Grade 1 adenocarcinoma was most common in the white (37%) and coloured groups (38%), and grade 2 was most common in the black group (39%). There was a significantly lower percentage of patients with T3-4 disease at diagnosis in the white group (47%) than the coloured (61%) and black (62%) groups. Mean serum PSA at diagnosis was significantly higher in the black than the coloured and white groups (766.1,673.3 and 196.1 ng/ml, respectively). Potentially curative therapy (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy) was chosen by 31% of white, 23% of coloured and only 12% of black patients. The mean duration of follow-up was significantly shorter in the black than in the white or coloured groups (24.0, 31.5 and 35.0 months, respectively). Conclusions: Black men presented with higher grade and stage disease and higher serum PSA, received potentially curative treatment less often, and had a shorter follow-up (probably owing to shorter survival) than the white and coloured groups. Greater prostate cancer awareness and education among patients and physicians and more widespread use of PSA screening of presymptomatic men at risk of prostate cancer is needed.",prostate cancer
"High-risk nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is a lethal disease that previously lacked clear treatment options. Progression to bone metastases is associated with significant morbidity and high cost. Apalutamide, an androgen receptor inhibitor, has substantial clinical response in nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Apalutamide + androgen deprivation therapy is well tolerated and improves metastasis-free survival, progression-free survival and time to symptomatic progression, and is associated with a favorable trend of improved overall survival. Future research is needed to elucidate mechanisms of resistance to treatment with androgen signaling inhibitors.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is often a complex disease and one in which many aspects of the disease and the affected patient must be taken into consideration before decisions about diagnostic work-up, treatments, follow-up, etc. can be made.

"Background: There is uncertainty regarding if, when, and how localized prostate cancer should be managed. Methods: To examine evidence of a beneficial effect of aggressive treatment on metastatic failure and disease-specific mortality in clinically localized prostate cancer, the authors compiled data from the literature since 1980 regarding radical prostatectomy, external radiation therapy, and deferred treatment. Results: The weighted mean of reported disease-specific survival at 10 years was 93% for radical prostatectomy, 83% for deferred treatment, and 74% for external radiation therapy. To broaden the database we have also computed, from the recorded number of patients who died of prostate cancer and the number of person-years at risk, a calculated disease-specific survival at 10 years of 93% for radical prostatectomy, 83% for deferred treatment, and 62% for external radiation therapy. The data suggest a favorable treatment effect with regard to disease-specific mortality for radical prostatectomy, but not for external radiation therapy at 10 years of follow-up. This observation must be tempered by the absence of convincing randomized trials and by the possibility of selection biases in the reviewed studies. Conclusions: As judged from our analysis, clinically localized prostate cancer often has a protracted course associated with a significant competing mortality and marginal benefit from radical prostatectomy at 10 years in terms of the endpoints used.",prostate cancer
"Suppression of androgen levels in blood of stage D2 prostate cancer patients has been the prominent treatment for advanced prostate cancer. However, the duration of hormone sensitivity of prostate tumor is variable. The type of initial response to hormonal treatment, the length of response and patient's survival are in direct association with disease aggressiveness. Recently, an arithmetic formula expressing disease aggressivity was computed using pretreatment values of prostatic acid phosphatase (P.A.P.), alkaline phosphatase (A.P.), degree of tumor differentiation and number of bone metastases. This aggressiveness score was related to disease response and patients outcome receiving hormonal treatments. The use of an arithmetic formula to express disease aggressivity could result in a subdivision of the disease. The identification of the subgroup of stage D2 patients destined not to benefit from hormonal manipulation could change the strategies employed up until today for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Similar to normal organs arising from normal stem cells, cancers can be viewed as organs composed of heterogeneous cellular populations arising from cancer cells with indefinite proliferation abilities. The continuous malignant progression is maintained by the proliferation of cancer stem cells and not the progeny that undergo limited proliferation before terminally differentiating. Effective therapy must eradicate malignant cells with unlimited clonogenic expansion within the primary tumor bulk. Thus, resolving both the specific cell of origin for prostate cancer and the interactions between the cells and the surrounding microenvironment within the cancer stem cell niche are crucial to appropriately define rational targets for therapeutic intervention and cure prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and is recognised as a significant health problem. Treatment of advanced or metastatic prostate cancer is challenging, and support and care should be tailored to meet the individual's needs.

"The early detection of asymptomatic prostate cancer has led to the increased incidence of tumours that are unlikely to become symptomatic during life, so called indolent cancers. The prediction of low risk and indolent prostate cancer is needed to avoid overtreatment by unnecessary invasive therapies, and select men for active surveillance. Some of the currently available nomograms predicting these low risk tumours have been validated in independent populations. However, assessment to the compliance with their treatment advises based on the calculation of probability are scarce. The ultimate value of nomograms for the urologic practice can only be assessed by analysing their practical implementation.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease for which the molecular mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. Prostate cancer research has traditionally focused on genomic and epigenetic alterations affecting the proteome, but over the last decade non-coding RNAs, especially microRNAs, have been recognized to play a key role in prostate cancer progression. A considerable number of individual microRNAs have been found to be deregulated in prostate cancer and their biological significance elucidated in functional studies. This review will delineate the current advances regarding the involvement of microRNAs and their targets in prostate cancer biology as well as their potential usage in the clinical management of the disease. The main focus will be on microRNAs contributing to initiation and progression of prostate cancer, including androgen signalling, cellular plasticity, stem cells biology and metastatic processes. To conclude, implications on potential future microRNA-based therapeutics based on the recent advances regarding the interplay between microRNAs and their targets are discussed.",prostate cancer
"Objective: MRI of the prostate improves diagnostic accuracy of prostate cancer. Different fusion approaches with transrectal ultrasound images are employed. To determine detection rate of prostate cancer in men undergoing transperineal MRIbased cognitive fusion biopsy. Materials and methods: One hundred and sixty-four consecutive men underwent a multiple-core prostate transperineal biopsy. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to address the relationship between clinical parameters and prostate cancer detection rate. Results: One hundred and fourteen patients underwent mpMRI prior to the transperineal biopsy, 52 (45%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer, of them, 36 had Gleason score ≥7 (69%). Among these 114 patients, 82 had suspicious lesions on MRI, and 43 of them were diagnosed with cancer (52%). On multivariate analysis, the most significant independent predictive factors were PSA density (P<0.001) and suspicious MRI lesion (P=0.006). Men with a PSA density of more than 0.22 and a suspicious lesion on MRI had a detection rate of 78%. Detection rate among 50 patients with no MRI study prior to this biopsy was 26%. Conclusions: This study showed that among a group of mostly multi-biopsied patients, the presence of mpMRI lesions and high PSA density values helped to detect clinically significant prostate cancer using cognitive MRI/TRUS fusion biopsies.",prostate cancer
"Stereotactic body radiotherapy, also known as stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR), is an emerging treatment option for lung, prostate, liver and other tumors. Key factors in SABR are delivery of a high-dose radiation per fraction, proper patient positioning and target localization. Our review details the various radiotherapy techniques, dose fractionation schedules and toxicities for prostate SABR. Ongoing Phase II/III SABR studies across various risk groups have been included. It also discusses the role of conscientious focal dose escalation of the dominant intraprostatic nodule, integrating multiparametric MRI into radiotherapy protocols and finally cost-effectiveness of SABR.",prostate cancer
Node-positive prostate cancer patients represent a small proportion of all prostate cancers for whom limited prospective information is available. Most retrospective or cohort data strongly suggest however that radiotherapy combined with androgen-depriving therapies is the preferable treatment in this setting.

"Value in health care is measured by outcomes and expense. An agreed upon desirable outcome can be indexed against the health care expenditure required for procurement. Prostate cancer treatment is an especially difficult subject for investigation of value. The late onset of the disease, coupled with competitive mortality risk, confounds value analysis. When cost considerations are made paramount, observation is the apparent treatment of choice. J. Surg. Oncol. 2016;114:288-290. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",prostate cancer
"Background: To evaluate cause-specific mortality following radical prostatectomy (RP) in a population cohort of US men adjusting for competing risks. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify 120,392 men undergoing RP for clinically localized prostate cancer between 1988 and 2003. Cause-specific mortality data were extracted through 2006 and cumulative incidence was estimated using a competing risks approach. Results: The stage distribution of the cancers was 32% local, 28% regional, 40% unknown, and 80% of tumors Gleason ≤ 7. Median follow-up was 7 years. The 15-year prostate cancer-specific mortality was 5.3% and the non-prostate cancer mortality was 30.6%. Stage, grade and race had minimal impact on non-prostate cancer mortality. At 15 years following surgery, mortality due to cardiovascular diseases was 11%, other cancers 9.1%, and other causes 10.5%. Among men ≥ 65 years, 15-year cancer-specific mortality was 6% and non-prostate cancer mortality was 40.8%. Conclusions: Following RP, death from cardiovascular diseases, other cancers, and other causes is far more common than death from prostate cancer. In men diagnosed with prostate cancer, significant efforts should be made to prevent, diagnose, and treat these diseases.",prostate cancer
"Most patients with prostate cancer have disease that has extended beyond the confines of the gland at the time of diagnosis. The effect of earlier detection on morbidity and death requires further study, as does assessment of prognostic factors and optimal therapy for individual patients. Recent reports indicate the utility of using prostate specific antigen and digital rectal examination as preliminary tests to identify patients in whom further study by prostate ultrasonography will improve detection rates. The algorithm presented may be a useful guide in sequencing detection approaches. The value of mass screening for prostate cancer by any existing means remains unproven.",prostate cancer
"The application of nanotechnology in medicine is offering many exciting possibilities in healthcare. Engineered nanoparticles have the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and the therapy of several diseases, particularly by targeted delivery of anticancer drugs and imaging contrast agents. Prostate cancer, the second most common cancer in men, represents one of the major epidemiological problems, especially for patients in the advanced age. There is a substantial interest in developing therapeutic options for treatment of prostate cancer based on use of nanodevices, to overcome the lack of specificity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents as well as for the early detection of precancerous and malignant lesions. Herein, we highlight on the recent development of nanotechnology strategies adopted for the management of prostate cancer. In particular, the combination of targeted and controlled-release polymer nanotechnologies has recently resulted in the clinical development of BIND-014, a promising targeted Docetaxel-loaded nanoprototype, which can be validated for use in the prostate cancer therapy. However, several limitations facing nanoparticle delivery to solid tumours, such as heterogeneity of intratumoural barriers and vasculature, cytotoxicity and/or hypersensitivity reactions to currently available cancer nanomedicines, and the difficult in developing targeted nanoparticles with optimal biophysicochemical properties, should be still addressed for a successful tumour eradication.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin-related cancer in men. With advances in technology, the care and treatment for men with this disease continues to become more complex. Large databases offer researchers a unique opportunity to conduct prostate cancer research in various areas, and provide important information that helps patients and providers determine prognosis after treatment. Furthermore, the studies using these databases may provide information on how side effects from various treatments can affect one's quality of life. Finally, information from these datasets can help to identify factors that determine why patients receive the treatments they do. Despite this, these databases are not without limitations. In this review, we discuss various available, national, multicenter, and institutional databases in the context of prostate cancer research, citing numerous important studies that have impacted on our understanding of prostate cancer outcomes.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: Traditional grayscale ultrasonography has poor discrimination between benign and malignant areas within the prostate. Current biopsy techniques commonly miss prostate cancer when present within the gland, with the majority of prostate biopsies negative for cancer. Enhanced ultrasound (US) modalities may improve the visualization of the prostate and better detect foci of prostate cancer. These enhanced US modalities include intravenous contrast enhancement, to better visualize areas with increased blood flow within the prostate, which may be indicative of latent prostate cancer. We reviewed the current literature for contrast-enhanced transrectal prostate ultrasonography. Recent findings: Numerous American and international studies demonstrate improved prostate cancer detection when contrast-enhanced US biopsy techniques are used. Enhanced US modalities include the use of harmonic imaging and flash replenishment techniques, as well as quantitative measurement of blood flow within the prostate. Vascular areas visualized with these techniques targeted for prostate biopsy yield improved prostate cancer detection rates. US contrast microbubbles linked to antibodies or small molecules may also allow targeted visualization and delivery of agents to the prostate. Summary: Enhanced US modalities with intravenous contrast enhancement dramatically improve vascular imaging and resolution within the prostate. Targeted biopsies have higher yield for prostate cancer detection, and may prove useful for the initial evaluation of patients with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen levels, as well as for patients with persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen after negative prostate biopsy.",prostate cancer
"More than any other cancer, prostate cancer screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests increases the risk a man will have to face a diagnosis of prostate cancer. The best evidence from screening trials suggests a small but finite benefit from prostate cancer screening in terms of prostate cancer-specific mortality, about 1 fewer prostate cancer death per 1000 men screened over 10 years. The more serious harms of prostate cancer screening, such as erectile dysfunction and incontinence, result from cancer treatment with surgery or radiation, particularly for men whose PSA-detected cancers were never destined to cause morbidity or mortality.",prostate cancer
"Recent advances in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have started to change the therapeutic landscape allowing clinicians to choose from a broad range of treatment options. Understanding the mechanisms that transform prostate cancer (PCA) into a castration-resistant state has enabled investigators to explore critical pathways involved in such process allowing for rational therapeutic design. These novel therapies complement the modest success that chemotherapy has demonstrated in recent years. In this review, we discuss the different mechanisms that render PCA castration resistant and elaborate on the nonchemotherapy approaches evolving in CRPC. These include agents targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor, endothelin receptor antagonists, angiogenesis inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents, immunotherapy, novel antiandrogens, and delivery of cytotoxic agents via therapeutic antibodies. This timely review coincides with the identification of newer therapies in this setting affirming our steady movement towards better disease control.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of death in the male population worldwide. Various clinical samples such as urine, blood serum, and prostatic fluid have been commonly used for the identification of PCa-associated molecular changes. Tissue, the site of oncogenesis, is increasingly gaining more attention as a study material for studies aimed at the discovery of biomarkers for predicting the disease outcome and therapeutic targets. Areas covered: This review is the output of a systematic literature search on PubMed to retrieve articles relevant to the proteomic analysis of tissues for the study of PCa. Studies performed during the last 10 years using human tissues are summarized. Expert commentary: Multiple proteomics studies were performed in the past 10 years focusing on PCa initial diagnosis and staging. Even though some reproducible findings have been reported, many studies lacked adequate validation of findings and relied on relatively lower-resolution proteomics techniques compared to the current state of the art. Incorporation of high-resolution proteomics techniques, including investigations of protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), is expected in the near future to complement other -omics and enhance current efforts toward the molecular subtyping of PCa for patient stratification.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer, the most common male cancer, affects one in eight American men. Risk factors for the disease include increased age, race, and family history of prostate cancer. To date, surgery, radiation, and hormonal therapy have been the mainstays of treatment. In the past, chemotherapy served only a palliative role for men with prostate cancer and failed to produce a survival advantage or any significant measurable disease response. However, for the first time, docetaxel-based regimens have demonstrated improved survival in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer in two different, large, phase III studies. Additionally, a number of novel agents are being developed with the hope that treatment for men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer will be improved. Oncology nurses provide critical symptom management strategies as well as education to men with prostate cancer and their partners. Therefore, maintaining current state of the knowledge about best practices and treatment for prostate cancer is crucial. This, in turn, directs efforts to educate patients and family members about treatments and management of side effects.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer affecting men in the Western world. Its relative incidence increases exponentially with age and a steady increase is observed with extended life span. A sedentary lifestyle represents an important risk factor and a decrease in prostate cancer prevalence is associated with exercise. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process remain unknown. We hypothesize that reactive oxygen species generated by physical exercise are a key regulatory factor in prostate cancer prevention. Aging is correlated with increased oxidative stress (OS), which in turn provides a favorable environment for tumorigenesis. Running training is known to enhance the antioxidant defense system, reducing oxidative stress. In this context, the decrease in OS induced by exercise may delay the development of prostate cancer. This review focuses on oxidative stress-based mechanisms leading to prostate cancer sensitization to exercise, which could have some impact on the development of novel cancer therapeutic strategies.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, with remarkably different prognosis across all stages. Increased circulating tumor cell (CTC) count (≥ 5) using the CellSearch assay has been identified as one of the markers that can be used to predict survival, with added value beyond currently available prognostic factors. Recently, androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) detection has been associated with worse outcomes for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) treated with novel androgen receptor-signaling (ARS) inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide but not taxane chemotherapies. Areas covered: In this manuscript, the authors review the available biomarkers in CRPC and discuss emerging data on the value of CTC-derived AR-V7 status to assess prognosis and its potential role to guide treatment selection for patients with advanced prostate cancer. Expert commentary: Current evidence supports AR-V7 status as a prognostic biomarker and also as a potential predictive biomarker for patients with mCRPC. The authors expect that the incorporation of AR-V7 status and other biomarkers (e.g. AR mutations) in the sequential assessment of patients with advanced prostate cancer will lead to a more rational use of available and future therapies, with significant improvements in outcomes for our patients.",prostate cancer
"Introduction: Metastatic prostate cancer is an incurable disease that is treated with a variety of hormonal therapies targeting various nodes of the androgen receptor (AR) pathway. Invariably patients develop resistance and become castration resistant. Common treatments for castration-resistant disease include novel hormonal therapies, such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiopharmaceuticals. As this disease generally remains incurable, understanding the molecular underpinnings of resistance pathways is critical in designing therapeutic strategies to delay or overcome such resistance. Areas covered: This review will explore the resistance mechanisms relevant to hormonal agents, such as AR-V7 expression and others, as well as discussing new approaches being developed to treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that take advantage of these new insights. A literature search was performed to identify all published clinical trials related to androgen therapy mechanisms of drug resistance in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Expert opinion: Androgen therapy resistance mechanisms are varied, and include modification of all nodes in the androgen signaling pathway. The optimal treatment for men with relapsed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is uncertain at this time. The authors recommend using available clinical data to guide treatment decision making until more specific biomarkers are clinically available.",prostate cancer
"Nearly 30,000 men die annually in the USA of prostate cancer, nearly uniformly from metastatic dissemination. Despite recent advances in hormonal, immunologic, bone-targeted, and cytotoxic chemotherapies, treatment resistance and further dissemination are inevitable in men with metastatic disease. Emerging data suggests that the phenomenon of epithelial plasticity, encompassing both reversible mesenchymal transitions and acquisition of stemness traits, may underlie this lethal biology of dissemination and treatment resistance. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of this cellular plasticity from preclinical models of prostate cancer and from biomarker studies of human metastatic prostate cancer has provided clues to novel therapeutic approaches that may delay or prevent metastatic disease and lethality over time. This review will discuss the preclinical and clinical evidence for epithelial plasticity in this rapidly changing field and relate this to clinical phenotype and resistance in prostate cancer while suggesting novel therapeutic approaches.",prostate cancer
"Clinical staging and histologic grading do not have sufficient predictive value to determine the response to therapy of any given prostate cancer. A review of the findings from the largest prospective study of patients with localized and locally advanced prostate cancer and from retrospective flow cytometric studies of specific disease stages suggests that DNA flow cytometry offers additional prognostic information for this disease. However, for the individual patient, this added information may have limited value, since approximately 15% of those with diploid disease will experience disease progression within 5 years as compared with half of those with nondiploid disease. We have found that ploidy does not predict length of survival once prostate cancer becomes disseminated, nor does it predict those who will benefit from receiving definitive radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. On the other hand, for those who have persistent tumor, we have frequently found increased ploidy abnormalities in the tumor sampled after radiation therapy and are currently correlating this finding with clinical outcome. We have also found that DNA flow cytometry can be used to predict tumor volume. For larger, grade-matched diploid tumors, there are significant increases in the proliferation of both the tumor and the adjacent benign tissue, which we take to be evidence of ""field effects"" in this disease. An even more obvious manifestation of the same phenomenon is seen in the occurrence of aneuploidy in benign tissue near high-grade, large-volume prostate cancer. It is concluded that DNA flow cytometry has much to tell us about the natural history and biologic behavior of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate multiparametric MR imaging (mpMRI) plays an important role in local evaluation after treatment of prostate cancer. After radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and focal therapy, mpMRI can be used to visualize normal post-treatment changes and to diagnose locally recurrent disease. An understanding of the various treatments and expected changes is essential for complete and accurate post-treatment mpMRI interpretation.",prostate cancer
"Background: Geographic barriers and limited availability of cancer specialists may influence early prostate cancer treatment options for rural men. This study compares receipt of different early prostate cancer treatments between rural and urban patients. Methods: Using 2004-2006 SEER Limited-Use Data, 51,982 early prostate cancer patients were identified (T1c, T2a, T2b, T2c, T2NOS; no metastases) who were most likely to benefit from definitive treatment (< 75 years old, Gleason score < 8, PSA ≤ 20). Definitive treatment included radical prostatectomy, daily external beam radiation for 5 to 8 weeks, brachytherapy, or combination external beam radiation/brachytherapy. Adjusted definitive treatment rates were calculated by rural-urban residence overall, and for different sociodemographic and cancer characteristics, and different states based on logistic regression analyses, using general estimating equation methods to account for clustering by county. Results: Adjusted definitive treatment rates were lower for rural (83.7%) than urban (87.1%) patients with early-stage prostate cancer (P ≤ .01). Rural men were more likely than urban men to receive non-definitive surgical treatment and no initial treatment. The lowest definitive treatment rates were among rural subgroups: 70 to 74 years (73.9%), African Americans (75.6%), American Indians/Alaska Natives (77.8%), single/separated/divorced (76.8%), living in New Mexico (69.3%), and living in counties with persistent poverty (79.6%). Conclusions: Between 2004 and 2006, this adjusted analysis found that men who were living in rural areas were less likely to receive definitive treatment for their early-stage prostate cancer than those living in urban areas. Certain rural patient groups with prostate cancer need particular attention to ensure their access to appropriate treatment. Rural providers, rural health care systems, and cancer advocacy and support organizations should ensure resources are in place so that the most vulnerable rural groups (men between 60 and 74 years of age; African American men; men who are single, separated, or divorced; and men living in rural New Mexico) can make informed prostate cancer treatment choices based on their preferences.",prostate cancer
"The number of prostate cancer patients is rapidly increasing in Japan, as aging people are more common and the lifestyle is more westernized. Another reason is that prostate specific antigen (PSA) is prevalent and PSA test can detect organ-confined prostate cancer in the early stage. In the past, endocrine therapy was the main treatment modality since many prostate cancer patients were diagnosed in the advanced stage. However, endocrine therapy is not suitable for young patients with organ-confined prostate cancer. Surgery and radiation therapy are becoming standard therapy for these patients. Although retropubic radical prostatectomy is widely performed,urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction are still problems. Other approaches such as laparoscopic prostatectomy, portless endoscopic prostatectomy and perineal prostatectomy are also performed. Radiation therapy is commonly used for organ-confined prostate cancer in Europe and the U.S.A. The advancement in computer technology has made it possible to accumulate enough radiation dose to target without damaging the surrounding organs (3 D conformal, intensity-modulated radiotherapy). Heavy ion particle radiotherapy is also attempted in some institutes. Moreover, brachytherapy can be another choice in radiation therapy. In Japan, only high-dose brachytherapy with (192)Ir has been performed. In July 2003, permanent seed brachytherapy with (121)I was legally approved in Japan, and more organ-confined prostate cancer patients are expected to undergo this treatment. There are several treatment modalities for organ-confined prostate cancer patients these days. Therefore, not only tumor grade and stage, but also patients'lifestyle and thought should be considered in determining treatment.",prostate cancer
"Despite much recent progress, prostate cancer continues to represent a major cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity in men. Since early studies on the role of the androgen receptor that led to the advent of androgen deprivation therapy in the 1940s, there has long been intensive interest in the basic mechanisms underlying prostate cancer initiation and progression, as well as the potential to target these processes for therapeutic intervention. Here, we present an overview of major themes in prostate cancer research, focusing on current knowledge of principal events in cancer initiation and progression. We discuss recent advances, including new insights into the mechanisms of castration resistance, identification of stem cells and tumor-initiating cells, and development of mouse models for preclinical evaluation of novel therapuetics. Overall, we highlight the tremendous research progress made in recent years, and underscore the challenges that lie ahead.",prostate cancer
"Urologists have considered themselves to be the experts in the use of digital rectal examination for the evaluation of diseases of the prostate. However, without close attention to the teaching of this examination, it probably is inaccurate and unreliable. Moreover, many patients who are destined to die of prostate cancer never develop a palpable abnormality. In patients with prostate cancer, a palpable abnormality usually indicates the presence of carcinoma, but the majority of patients will be upstaged by pathologic examination. In patients undergoing a digitally guided biopsy, it appears critical that those with a negative biopsy be followed closely, as they have a measurable risk of developing overt carcinoma. It is unclear how transrectal ultrasound will interface with digital rectal examination because of the multiple echo patterns this disease can exhibit.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: The present review highlights the year's most important developments in the risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer. Recent findings: Recent research has helped define the prognostic importance of incorporating tertiary Gleason 5 pattern into the Gleason sum as well as interpretation of prostate-specific antigen levels when patients are being treated with low doses of finasteride. More data have emerged on the benefits of active treatment in elderly men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer. Particular subgroups of high-risk postprostatectomy patients (low postsurgical prostate-specific antigen level, positive surgical margins) may benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy. For salvage radiotherapy, the first comprehensive nomogram has been developed. Further data is emerging on the cardiovascular risks associated with androgen deprivation therapy even when administered for shorter treatment durations in conjunction with definitive local therapy. In addition, androgen deprivation therapy may be associated with earlier incidence of fatal cardiovascular events. For advanced prostate cancer, the first prospective trial defining taxane-resistant prostate cancer is described. Summary: The data of the present year have important implications in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer by urologists, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists.",prostate cancer
"The routine determination of PSA has generated an important consequence: a really favourable migration of the tumour stage at the moment of diagnosis. It implies an exponential increase in the requirement of primary treatments with curative intention. Radical prostatectomy with preservation of neuro-vascular bundles is the gold standard for the treatment of localized prostate cancer but laparoscopic and robotic surgery have arrived with force during last five years. These therapeutic approaches and the new emerging techniques (those interventions that are not routine practice in the prostate cancer) guided by images present a constant research activity. Here, we perform a review of every possibility to treat the cancer of prostate.",prostate cancer
"Given its long natural history, prostate cancer has become an ideal model for the clinical and basic science study of neoplastic disease in distinct pathologic phases: tumor initiation, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Chronic or recurrent acute inflammation, a product of infectious agents or other sources, has potential promotional roles in each of these phases. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), because of their ability to attenuate inflammation, as well as possibly direct anti-cancer properties associated with the inhibition of stromal cyclooxygenase-2, are potential candidates for clinical use in prostate cancer. Though epidemiologic evidence indicating a reduced risk of prostate cancer for NSAID users supports a chemoprotective benefit, observational assessment and clinical trials of these agents among large cohorts of prostate cancer patients are needed to determine their value in prostate cancer management.",prostate cancer
"Purpose/objectives: To compare the quality-of-life (QOL) perceptions of men treated for prostate cancer with surgery to those of men treated for prostate cancer with radiation therapy. Design: A two-group descriptive study. Setting: Midwestern community cancer center and teaching hospital. Sample: The study group consisted of 121 men: 68 treated by radical prostatectomy and 53 treated with radiation therapy. Methods: Mailed survey using the Quality of Life Index (QLI) Cancer Version and the University of California at Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index. Main research variables: QOL; level of urinary, bowel, and sexual function; impact of dysfunction on patients' lives. Findings: No significant differences were found between the groups in QLI scores, but significant differences were found in urinary, bowel, and sexual function. Urinary function was superior in the radiation therapy group (p = 0.0002). Patients who had undergone surgery were more likely to leak urine every day (p < 0.001). Only 6% of patients who had undergone radiation therapy needed to use pads or diapers as compared to 32% of patients who had undergone surgery. Bowel function was better in the surgery group (p = 0.05). Both groups reported poor sexual function, although it was worse in the surgery group (p = 0.009). Conclusions: The patients who were treated with surgery had significantly worse urinary and sexual function and better bowel function than those treated with radiation therapy. QOL scores were consistent with these findings, although they did not differ significantly between groups. Implications for nursing practice: This information on the problems of survivors of prostate cancer after surgery and radiation therapy and the effects of therapy on QOL will assist nurses in providing patient education, emotional support, and rehabilitative interventions.",prostate cancer
"The objective of this study was to evaluate the protein level of glypican-5 (GPC5) and its relationship with clinicopathologic significance in prostate cancer. The protein level of GPC5 in 160 prostate cancer tissues and 60 adjacent normal samples was examined by immunohistochemistry analysis, and the results were correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. The level of GPC5 in prostate cancer tissues was markedly lower than that in normal cases, especially in high-risk prostate cancer. Additionally, the low expression of GPC5 was closely associated with increased serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), higher Gleason scores, advanced tumor stage (T3), positive lymph node metastasis, and biochemical recurrence. Moreover, GPC5 low expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of patients with prostate cancer. GPC5 protein expression showed a close correlation with the tumorigenesis and tumor progression of prostate cancer, and that might be applied as a novel biomarker for the prediction of diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: To explore several serum and genetic-based biomarkers that may prove useful in following men being managed with active surveillance for localized prostate cancer by predicting those that either have the potential to develop, or already harbor occult high grade disease. Recent findings: There is increasing evidence that serum biomarkers human Kallikrein 2, early prostate cancer antigen, urokinase-type plasminogen activator/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, transforming growth factor-β1 and interleukin-6/interleukin-6 receptor and genetic biomarkers BRCA1 and BRCA2, Phosphatase and tensin homolog, cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene and NKX3.1 may predict for aggressive high grade disease and are identifiable early in prostate carcinogenesis. Summary: One of the barriers of widespread adoption of active surveillance for low risk, localized prostate cancer is the concern that some patients may harbor occult high-risk disease at diagnosis, or develop more aggressive/noncurable disease not detected by our current well established prognostic factors. This review examines several serum and genetic-based biomarkers that appear to be of value in localized prostate cancer, unlike the vast majority of more established prostate cancer biomarkers that have been validated in far more advanced disease. Although the biomarkers discussed show exciting promise, their clinical utility is unknown, and their role in the active surveillance scenario needs further study.",prostate cancer
"The heat shock proteins (HSP) constitute a superfamily of chaperone proteins present in all cells and in all cell compartments, operating in a complex interplay with synergistic/overlapping multiplicity of functions, even though the common effect is cell protection. Several reasons explain the need for investigating HSP in prostate cancer: (1) these molecules function as chaperones of tumorigenesis accompanying the emergence of prostate cancer cells, (2) they appear as useful molecular markers associated with disease aggressiveness and with resistance to anticancer therapies including hormone therapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hyperthermia, and (3) they can be used as targets for therapies. The latter can be accomplished by: (i) interrupting the interaction of HSP (mainly HSPC1) with various client proteins that are protected from degradation when chaperoned by the HSP; (ii) using the chaperone and adjuvant capabilities of certain HSP to present antigenic peptides to the immune system, so this system can recognise the prostate tumour cells as foreign to mount an effective antitumoral response; and (iii) using treatment planning models taking into account the HSP expression levels to obtain more effective therapies. In summary, the study of the HSP during tumorigenesis as well as during cancer progression, and the inclusion of treatment designs targeting HSP combined with other treatment modalities, should improve prostate cancer survival in the near future.",prostate cancer
"The cells of the prostate gland are dependent on cell signaling pathways to regulate their growth, maintenance and function. However, perturbations in key signaling pathways, resulting in neoplastic transformation of cells in the prostate epithelium, are likely to generate subtypes of prostate cancer which may subsequently require different treatment regimes. Accumulating evidence supports multiple sources of stem cells in the prostate epithelium with distinct cellular origins for prostate tumorigenesis documented in animal models, while human prostate cancer stem-like cells (PCSCs) are typically enriched by cell culture, surface marker expression and functional activity assays. As future therapies will require a deeper understanding of its cellular origins as well as the pathways that drive PCSC maintenance and tumorigenesis, we review the molecular and functional evidence supporting dysregulation of PI3K/AKT, RAS/MAPK and STAT3 signaling in PCSCs, the development of castration resistance, and as a novel treatment approach for individual men with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Objective: To explore the preferences of male primary care patients and their spouses for the outcomes of prostate cancer screening and treatment, and quality of life with metastatic prostate cancer. Design: Cross-sectional design. Setting: Primary care clinics in Galveston County, Texas. Patients: One hundred sixty-eight couples in which the husband was a primary care patient and a candidate for prostate cancer screening. Measurements and main results: Preferences were measured as utilities for treatment outcomes and quality of life with metastatic disease by the time trade-off method for the husband and the wife individually and then conjointly for the couple. For each health state considered, husbands associated lower utilities for the health states than did their wives. Couples' utilities fell between those of husbands and wives (all comparisons were significant at P <.01). For partial and complete impotence and mild-to-moderate incontinence, the median utility value for the wives was 1.0, indicating that most wives did not associate disutility with their husbands having to experience these treatment complications. Conclusions: Male primary care patients who are candidates for prostate cancer screening evaluate the outcomes of prostate cancer treatment and life with advanced prostate cancer as being far worse than do their wives. Because the choice between quantity and quality of life is a highly individualistic one, both the patient and his partner should be involved in making decisions about prostate cancer screening.

"Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in men in the USA, but the effect of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment on men in a sexual minority group, including men who have sex with men and transgender women, is poorly understood. Efforts to study this population are complicated, as cancer registries do not routinely collect information on sexual orientation. As a result, epidemiological data regarding this population have come from small studies that have included disparate rates of prostate cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment. Qualitative studies indicate that prostate cancer is experienced differently by sexual minorities, with distinct health-care needs that arise owing to differences in sexual practices, social support systems and relationships with the medical community. Notably, sexual minorities have been reported to experience poorer health-related quality of life outcomes than heterosexual men, and tend to have less robust social support systems, experience increased psychological distress caused by sexual dysfunction (areas of which are unmeasured after treatment), experience isolation within the health-care system and express increased levels of dissatisfaction with treatment. The incidence of prostate cancer actually seems to be decreased in men from sexual minorities living with HIV, despite there being no differences in screening and treatment, with poor cancer-specific mortality. Although the literature on patients with prostate cancer in men from sexual minority groups has historically been sparse, peer-reviewed research in this area has grown considerably during the past decade and has become an important field of study.",prostate cancer
"It has been noted that the most important evidence for a benefit of early detection of prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing would be a decline in prostate cancer mortality rates to levels below those existing before diagnostic use of PSA testing. We document a decrease in U.S. prostate cancer mortality rates in white men less than 85 years of age to levels below those existing in 1986, the year use of PSA testing was approved. In fact, for men 60-79 years of age, prostate cancer mortality rates were lower in 1997 than in any year since 1950. Although it has been argued that the decrease in prostate cancer mortality rates began too soon to be explained by PSA testing, stage-specific survival rates indicate that a rapid decrease in mortality may be explained by the large number of high-grade prostate cancers detected before metastasis. If recent decreases in U.S. prostate cancer mortality rates are due to early detection using PSA testing, randomized clinical trials investigating PSA testing will show early evidence of a mortality benefit.",prostate cancer
"Objective: To examine how family history of prostate cancer, risk perceptions, and heuristic decision strategies influence prostate cancer screening behavior. Methods: Men with a first-degree family history of prostate cancer (FDRs; n = 207) and men without a family history (PM; n = 239) completed a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) examining prostate cancer risk perceptions, PSA testing behaviors, perceptions of similarity to the typical man who gets prostate cancer (representativeness heuristic), and availability of information about prostate cancer (availability heuristic). A path model explored family history as influencing the availability of information about prostate cancer (number of acquaintances with prostate cancer and number of recent discussions about prostate cancer) to mediate judgments of risk and to predict PSA testing behaviors and family history as a moderator of the relationship between representativeness (perceived similarity) and risk perceptions. Results: FDRs reported greater risk perceptions and a greater number of PSA tests than did PM. Risk perceptions predicted increased PSA testing only in path models and was significant only for PM in multi-Group SEM analyses. Family history moderated the relationship between similarity perceptions and risk perceptions such that the relationship between these variables was significant only for FDRs. Recent discussions about prostate cancer mediated the relationships between family history and risk perceptions, and the number of acquaintances men knew with prostate cancer mediated the relationship between family history and PSA testing behavior. Conclusions: Family history interacts with the individuals' broader social environment to influence risk perceptions and screening behavior. Research into how risk perceptions develop and what primes behavior change is crucial to underpin psychological or public health intervention that seeks to influence health decision making.",prostate cancer
"Background/aim: An evaluation if radiomic features of CT perfusion (CTP) can predict tumor grade and aggressiveness in prostate cancer was performed. Materials and methods: Forty-seven patients had biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer, and received a CTP. Blood volume (BV), blood flow (BF) and mean transit time (MTT) maps were derived and 1,701 radiomic features were determined per patient. Regression models were built to estimate post-surgical Gleason score (GS), microvessel density (MVD) and distinguish between the different risk groups. Results: Six out of the 47 patients had to be excluded from further analysis. A weak relationship between postsurgical GS and one radiomic parameter was found (R2=0.21, p=0.01). The same parameter combined with MTT inter-quartile range was prognostic for the risk group categorisation (AUC=0.81). Two different radiomic parameters were able to distinguish between low-intermediate risk and high-intermediate risk (AUC=0.77). Four parameters correlated with MVD (R2=0.53, p<0.02). Conclusion: This exploratory study shows the potential of radiomics to classify prostate cancer.",prostate cancer

"Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer diagnosis in men and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Androgen ablation is effective initially, and progression of disease often occurs in many patients. Although recent reports have noted a survival benefit when patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer are treated with docetaxel, patients still have disease progression. Angiogenesis plays a pivotal role for the growth, invasion, and metastasis of prostate cancer. Therefore, antiangiogenesis is a promising new therapeutic modality. More than 20 antiangiogenic agents are now in various stages of clinical trials. We discuss current knowledge on controlling tumor angiogenesis and advances in the development of antiangiogenic agents with promising antitumor activity in prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify and describe the impact of prostate cancer and its treatment on men's sexuality and intimate relationships from the perspective of the men's lived experiences. Description of the study: Ten men diagnosed with prostate cancer were interviewed. Verbal transcripts were analyzed using an interpretive phenomenological approach based on Heidegger's philosophy. Results: ""Altered sexual patterns"" was identified as the major theme, which in turn was influenced by five minor themes: choice of consequences; age affecting sexual life; hope of improvement; acceptance of altered sexual life; and image of manliness. Choice of consequences showed that survival is paramount, as interviewees often felt that they were choosing between death or sexual dysfunction. Age affecting sexual life identified sexual dysfunction as caused by natural effects of aging. Hope of improvement showed that several men hoped for improvement in sexual function, although it had been years since their treatment. Acceptance of altered sexual life illustrated that the men often felt the need to accept their altered sex life, with their wives playing an important role in this acceptance. Finally, the theme image of manliness showed the men's attempts to acknowledge and cope with the changes in their self-image. Clinical implications: It is important that healthcare professionals adopt a comprehensive approach in communicating information about prostate cancer treatment choices and potential side effects that includes the patient and his partner. Communication and counselling about treatment options, potential side effects, and potential strategies to manage side effects should be offered both at the time of diagnosis and at post-treatment follow-up.",prostate cancer
"Standard grayscale transrectal ultrasound has a poor sensitivity for detection of prostate cancer. Saturation biopsy schemes have improved prostate cancer detection rates over standard template biopsy schemes, but carry additional morbidity and cost. Enhanced ultrasound modalities (EUM), including color and power Doppler, contrast-enhancement, harmonic and flash replenishment imaging, and elastography have demonstrated improved prostate cancer detection. EUM targeting areas with increased or abnormal vascularity or firmness for biopsy offer improved prostate cancer detection. EUM, detect prostate cancer more efficiently than standard ultrasound guided biopsies. These emerging technologies may potentially augment standard prostate biopsy in clinical practice.",prostate cancer
"Management options for localized prostate cancer include radical prostatectomy (RP), radiation therapy (external-beam radiation therapy [EBRT] or brachytherapy), with and without androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), or active surveillance, also known as watchful waiting. Ultimately, the choice of treatment is determined by a variety of factors, including institutional preference, individual physician judgment, patient preference, and resource availability. In this editorial, we make the case for radiation therapy (EBRT or brachytherapy) as the management modality of choice for localized prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Oligometastatic prostate cancer has been proposed as an intermediate stage between localized and extensively disseminated disease. Oligometastatic disease is being diagnosed more frequently due to the advances in imaging tests. Nevertheless, there is no consensus definition yet of oligometastatic prostate cancer. The importance of this entity is that several studies have pointed out that local and metastasis directed treatment may improve survival in selected patients. However, we need the results of well controlled prospective randomized clinical trials to help a better understanding and management of oligometastatic prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Background: Compelling evidence indicates that environmental and life-style factors, in addition to well-known risk factors such as testosterone level and age, are important for the development of prostate cancer. Methods: In this review we summarize up-to-date knowledge about carcinogenesis in the prostate. The review is based on our own clinical research experience in this field and relevant articles identified by a literature search in the Medline and PubMed databases. Results: During carcinogenesis of the prostate, significant changes are consistently observed in several molecular pathways. These molecular pathways are possible targets for intervention directed at reversing, stopping, or delaying cancer development. Racial differences indicate that genetic factors are also important for the development of prostate cancer. Improved surrogate biomarkers are needed for appropriate initiation of therapy and in order to monitor response. Interpretation: Prostate cancer might be targeted early in the course of the disease provided that suitable markers reflecting carcinogenesis are identified.",prostate cancer
"The incidence of clinical prostate cancer varies across countries and ethnic groups. Genetic and epigenetic factors have been suggested as possible explanations to these variations, although no mesological factors with clearly significant effects have been identified. About 20% of patients with prostate cancer have a family history for this disease. Several studies have reported links between prostate cancer and breast cancer, suggesting that the same loci may predispose to both diseases. Identification of one or more inherited genes associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in some families may be useful for identifying high-risk individuals. The value of this approach has been demonstrated in other familial cancers, such as colon and breast cancer. Current goals of research in this field are to localize the gene(s) that predispose to familial prostate cancer and to identify the molecular alterations related to tumor progression in sporadic and familial prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Metabolic syndrome is associated with increased cancer risk and progression at almost all sites, including the prostate in high-stage prostate cancer. However, several reports have described an inverse relationship between metabolic syndrome and its components and low-stage incident prostate cancer. Such anomalies in cancer research hamper efforts to fight cancer. Evidence suggests that metabolic syndrome and its components have two distinct effects in prostate cancer, concealing prostate cancer in low-stage disease and promoting progression to high-stage incident, nonlocalized, and lethal prostate cancer. The concealment of prostate cancer by metabolic syndrome and its components might be related to bias mechanisms that reduce PSA level and lead to a delayed diagnosis of low-stage prostate cancer, meaning that fewer men with metabolic syndrome are diagnosed with low-stage disease. The inverse link between metabolic syndrome and its components and low-stage incident prostate cancer might simply be the result of such bias and the shortcomings of the diagnostic procedure rather than being related to prostate cancer biology itself. The evidence summarized here supports the hypothesis that the link between metabolic syndrome and its components and incident prostate cancer is a two-way and stage-dependent one, a theory that requires further research.",prostate cancer
"The search for new therapeutics for the treatment of prostate cancer is ongoing with a focus on the balance between the harms and benefits of treatment. New therapies are being constantly developed to offer treatments similar to radical therapies, with limited side effects. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising strategy in delivering focal treatment in primary as well as post radiotherapy prostate cancer. PDT involves activation of a photosensitizer (PS) by appropriate wavelength of light, generating transient levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several photosensitizers have been developed with a focus on treating prostate cancer like mTHPC, motexafin lutetium, padoporfin and so on. This article will review newly developed photosensitizers under clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer, along with the potential advantages and disadvantages in delivering focal therapy.",prostate cancer
"Early detection of prostate cancer is associated with the diagnosis of a considerable proportion of cancers that are indolent, and that will hardly ever become symptomatic during lifetime. Such overdiagnosis should be avoided in all forms of screening because of potential adverse psychological and somatic side effects. The main threat of overdiagnosis is overtreatment of indolent disease. Men with prostate cancer that is likely to be indolent may be offered active surveillance. Evaluation of active surveillance studies and validation of new biological parameters for risk assessment are expected.",prostate cancer
"In the human genome, there is a group of RNAs, called long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with do not have the function of encoding proteins and whose transcript length is greater than 200 nucleotides. The disorders of lncRNAs are often involved in the occurrence and progression of malignant tumors. A large number of studies have indicated the aberrant expression of lncRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) can regulate gene expressions at epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and cause changes in the biological behaviors of PCa cells. Some lncRNAs have been shown to be closely related to the castration resistance of PCa. In recent years, a variety of lncRNAs have been detected in the PCa tissue, prostatic fluid, serum, and urine, and somehow influenced radiotherapy and chemotherapy of tumors. The expressions of some lncRNAs are also associated with disease prognosis. Thus, lncRNAs are expected to become new diagnostic markers and a therapeutic target for PCa. This review focuses on the roles and action modes and mechanisms of some lncRNAs as well as their potential value of clinical application in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of PCa.",prostate cancer
"The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is the largest funder of prostate cancer research in the United States and indeed the world. It is sponsoring a number of studies to answer the significant questions pertinent to prostate cancer and pertinent to black men. These include studies of epidemiology; cancer prevention, screening, and control; clinical treatment; and basic science. In addition, the NCI is charged with dissemination of research findings to physicians and the lay public.

"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men. Despite earlier diagnosis due to prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening, it is still a disease of the elderly. Diagnosis is based on digital rectal examination (DRE) and PSA assessment. Refinements in PSA testing (age-specific reference ranges, free PSA, PSA density and velocity) increased specificity and limited unnecessary prostate biopsies. Diagnosis in earlier stages (T1 and T2) commonly leads to cure with current treatment modalities. These include radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy. Other treatment options under development include cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound. Metastatic prostate cancer is incurable and treatment is based on hormonal therapy. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has only limited role in hormone-independent prostate cancer. Radioisotopes and biphosphonates may alleviate bone pain and prevent osteoporosis and pathological fractures. Follow-up is based on PSA. Prognostic factors for recurrence include stage, Gleason score, pre- and posttreatment PSA. Quality of life issues play an important role in selecting treatment, especially in the elderly due to comorbidities that may negatively affect the overall quality of life. A holistic approach is recommended addressing all quality of life issues without focus only in cancer control.",prostate cancer
"A key study comparing radical prostatectomy and watchful waiting for prostate cancer has been updated with extended follow-up observation, demonstrating substantial benefits of surgery for reduced mortality mainly in younger men, but also reduced requirement for palliative treatment in older men. These findings should be interpreted within the current scenario of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer and up to one fifth of diagnosed patients will die of their disease. Current prognostic variables including T-category (of the TNM staging), the absolute or kinetics of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and the pathologic Gleason score (GS) are utilized to place men in low, intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer risk groupings. There is great heterogeneity within the non-indolent intermediate risk group with respect to clinical response. It is therefore imperative that further genetic and other prognostic factors be identified to better individualize treatment. Somatic alterations in prostate cancer. Herein, we review the potential for somatic alterations in tumor-associated genes (based on comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in prostate cancers to be novel prognostic, and possibly predictive, factors for prostate cancer radiotherapy response. Intermediate risk prostate cancers show alterations in a number of genes thought to be involved in radiosensitivity, DNA repair, cell death and stem cell renewal. These include deletions at 21q (TMPRSS2: ERG), 13q (RB1), 10q (PTEN), 8p (NKX3.1), additions at 8q21 (containing c-Myc)) and haplo-insufficiency for p53, PARP1, ATM and DNA-PKcs. Conclusions. The use of high-resolution CGH for fine-mapping of deletions and amplifications in pre-radiotherapy prostate cancer biopsies is feasible. Genetic alterations may delineate localized prostate cancer from systemic disease and be used as a predictive factor in that patients would be individually triaged to local (surgery versus radiotherapy) and/or adjuvant (adjuvant androgen ablation or post-operative radiotherapy) therapies in a prospective fashion to improve outcome. The knowledge of abnormal DNA repair pathways within in a given patient could allow for the judicious use of targeted agents (PARP/ATM inhibitors) as personalized medicine.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of internal malignancy among men worldwide, with an annual incidence of 679,000 cases, and an annual mortality load of 220,000 deaths, making it the sixth leading cause of cancer mortality among men. It is generally on the increase. Environmental and lifestyle factors may have an aetiological role in prostate cancer and hence may provide potential targets for future intervention. In fact, because of the disease high prevalence, slowly progressive nature, and long latency prostate cancer is a very good candidate for chemoprevention. Dietary agents have gained considerable attention as chemopreventive agents against prostate cancer. The methodology for this review included computerized literature searches of the PubMed database using the keywords 'chemoprevention of prostate cancer' from 1992 to 2007. This mini-review examines the influence of plant-derived dietary agents for which articles reported statistically significant effects in the management of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Recent scientific work supports the rapidly growing use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the most sensitive and specific imaging tool for detection, staging and treatment planning of prostate cancer. Its use can improve many aspects of prostate cancer management. By increasing the detection rate of clinically significant tumours with less biopsy-cores and improving the evaluation of tumours, localization, volume, extend and biological aggressiveness multiparametric MRI facilitate appropriate treatment selection of prostate cancer patients.",prostate cancer
"During the last few years a tremendous amount of media attention has been focused on prostate cancer. This increased visibility has been the direct result of the prostate specific antigen test, which has led to a doubling of the number of new cases detected in just 4 years. With this visibility has come controversy about which treatment is the most effective or whether this disease should be treated aggressively at all. The formation and rapid expansion of the prostate cancer support group movement are reviewed, and the positive and negative impacts of media coverage on present and future patients are assessed. My personal case is reviewed briefly to make a specific point about the hazards of watchful waiting. Other issues, such as mass screening, Prostate Cancer Awareness Week and expenditures for prostate cancer research, are examined in some detail.",prostate cancer
"Biomarkers are important for early detection of cancer, prognosis, response prediction, and detection of residual or relapsing disease. Special attention has been given to diagnostic markers for prostate cancer since it is thought that early detection and surgery might reduce prostate cancer-specific mortality. The use of prostate-specific antigen, PSA (KLK3), has been debated on the base of cohort studies that show that its use in preventive screenings only marginally influences mortality from prostate cancer. Many groups have identified alternative or additional markers, among which PCA3, in order to detect early prostate cancer through screening, to distinguish potentially lethal from indolent prostate cancers, and to guide the treatment decision. The large number of markers proposed has led us to the present study in which we analyze these indicators for their diagnostic and prognostic potential using publicly available genomic data. We identified 380 markers from literature analysis on 20,000 articles on prostate cancer markers. The most interesting ones appeared to be claudin 3 (CLDN3) and alpha-methysacyl-CoA racemase highly expressed in prostate cancer and filamin C (FLNC) and keratin 5 with highest expression in normal prostate tissue. None of the markers proposed can compete with PSA for tissue specificity. The indicators proposed generally show a great variability of expression in normal and tumor tissue or are expressed at similar levels in other tissues. Those proposed as prognostic markers distinguish cases with marginally different risk of progression and appear to have a clinically limited use. We used data sets sampling 152 prostate tissues, data sets with 281 prostate cancers analyzed by microarray analysis and a study of integrated genomics on 218 cases to develop a multigene score. A multivariate model that combines several indicators increases the discrimination power but does not add impressively to the information obtained from Gleason scoring. This analysis of 10 years of marker research suggests that diagnostic and prognostic testing is more difficult in prostate cancer than in other neoplasms and that we must continue to search for better candidates.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in men. However, African American/Black men are 60 % more likely to be diagnosed with and 2.4 times more likely to die from prostate cancer, compared to Non-Hispanic White men. Despite the increased burden of this malignancy, no evidence-based recommendation regarding prostate cancer screening exists for the high-risk population. Moreover, in addition to screening and detection, African American men may constitute a prime population for chemoprevention. Early detection and chemoprevention may thus represent an integral part of prostate cancer control in this population. Importantly, recent research has elucidated biological differences in the prostate tumors of African American compared to European American men. The latter may enable a more favorable response in African American men to specific chemopreventive agents that target relevant signal transduction pathways. Based on this evolving evidence, the aims of this review are threefold. First, we aim to summarize the biological differences that were reported in the prostate tumors of African American and European American men. Second, we will review the single- and multi-target chemopreventive agents placing specific emphasis on the pathways implicated in prostate carcinogenesis. And lastly, we will discuss the most promising nutraceutical chemopreventive compounds. Our review underscores the promise of chemoprevention in prostate cancer control, as well as provides justification for further investment in this filed to ultimately reduce prostate cancer morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population of African American men.",prostate cancer
"Although testosterone is the most abundant serum androgen, dihydrotestosterone is the main prostatic androgen. Testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone by the enzyme 5α-reductase (5α-R). Dihydrotestosterone plays an important role in several human diseases, including benign prostate enlargement and prostate cancer. The observation that males born with 5α-R 2 deficiency have never been reported to develop prostate cancer stimulated interest in development of 5α-R inhibitors. Thus far, 2 5α-R inhibitors are approved for clinical use. Several trials evaluated the use of 5α-R inhibitors in prostate cancer prevention and treatment and will be reviewed in this article.",prostate cancer
"Background: Patterns of care for prostate cancer patients in the United States have changed as early detection has improved. The National Cancer Data Base of the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer provides information about the treatment of patients in all age, race, and regional groups from institutions that represent cancer care at the community level as well as in medical centers. Methods: Data on 251,416 prostate cancer patients diagnosed between 1992 and 1994 were studied. Patient and disease characteristics, including age, race, the geographic region from which a case was reported, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, and tumor grade were related to the primary pattern of treatment. Stage-standardized comparisons were made among different age groups, race groups, and regional groups. Results: Stage and tumor grade varied little across age, race, and regional classifications. African American patients were more likely than white patients to have Stage IV prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis. Men older than 75 years had greater proportions than younger men of both the earliest and the most advanced stages of cancer. Overall, 24.6% of patients received no cancer-directed therapy, 11.6% were treated with hormones or endocrine surgery, 28.6% received radiation therapy, 28.3% underwent radical prostatectomy, and 6.9% were treated by other modalities or combinations of modalities. Treatment patterns varied markedly by age. The selection of radical prostatectomy relative to no treatment and radiation therapy varied by race and region. Conclusions: The results of this study showed that prostate cancer treatment varies by patient age, race, and geographic region. The reasons for some of these variations are not well understood and deserve further investigation.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer remains a major health concern for the male population throughout the Western world. It is today widely accepted that inflammation has a role in many human cancers. In fact, inflammation is thought to incite carcinogenesis by causing cell and genome damage, promoting cellular turnover and creating a tissue microenvironment that can enhance cell replication, angiogenesis and tissue repair. Accordingly, there is a body of literature suggesting a link between chronic inflammation and prostate cancer, in which prostate inflammation may contribute to the promotion of prostate cancer development. On the other hand, high levels of endogenous gonadal steroids are considered as risk factors for prostate cancer. Interestingly, it is clear that elevation of estrogens in the presence of testosterone results in a prostate-specific inflammatory response. Thus, it is possible that early inflammatory events stimulated by sex hormones serve as a prerequisite for the onset of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Background: Although treatment regimen have improved in the last few years, prostate cancer patients following a radical prostatectomy still experience severe disease- and treatment-related side effects, including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and psychological issues. Despite high incidence rates and the common adverse effects there is a lack of supportive measures for male patients and specific physical exercise recommendations for prostate cancer patients during rehabilitation or in the aftercare are still missing. Methods/design: The ProRehab Project aims to establish rehabilitative sports groups particularly for prostate cancer patients and to evaluate the effects of the offered exercise program. Starting 8-12 weeks after prostatectomy or combination therapy, prostate cancer patients will exercise for 15 months within a patient preference randomized controlled trial. One exercise session will be conducted within a pre-established rehabilitative sports group, while the other will be completed independently. Patients in the control group will not participate in the intervention. The main outcomes of the study include aerobic fitness, quality of life, incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Discussion: By combining science, practice, and public relations the first rehabilitative sports groups for prostate cancer patients in Germany have been set up and thus contribute to the care structure for prostate cancer patients. By offering a 15-month physical exercise intervention that is conducted in supervised group sessions, long-term lifestyle changes and therefore improvements in quality of life in prostate cancer patients can be expected.

"Background: Prostate cancer is a life-threatening disease that is not curable but can be controlled through treatment. Current treatments can result in unpleasant and distressing side effects for patients. Little was known until the 1970s about the psychological and psychosocial effects of these treatments, but studies have now been conducted on patient identity, self-esteem, incontinence, impotence and social support. Conclusion: A diagnosis of prostate cancer can have detrimental psychological effects for patients. However, using behavioural and coping strategies with cancer patients brings about an improvement in symptoms, functioning and emotion, thus enhancing quality of life for patients and their families.",prostate cancer
"The aim of the study was to evaluate clinical value of transperineal saturation biopsy (TPSB) in 52 patients with suspicious for prostate cancer (PCa): 31 - primary patients and 17 - men with non-effective transrectal biopsy. PCa was diagnosed in 31 of 52 (59,6%) patients. Focal lesions revealed in 6 (19,4%), multifocal - in another 25 (80,6%) cases. TPSB is very helpful in primary diagnosis and for therapy planning.",prostate cancer
"Treatment decisions after diagnosis of clinically localised prostate cancer are difficult due to variability in tumour behaviour. We therefore examined one of the most promising biomarkers in prostate cancer, Ki-67, in a cohort of 808 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1990 and 1996 and treated conservatively. Ki-67 expression was assessed immunohistochemically, in two laboratories, by two different scoring methods and the results compared with cancer-specific and overall survival. The power of the biomarker was compared with Gleason score and initial serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Both methods showed that Ki-67 provided additional prognostic information beyond that available from Gleason score and PSA: for the semi-quantitative method, Deltachi(2) (1 d.f.)=24.6 (P<0.0001), overall survival chi(2)=20.5 (P<0.0001), and for the quantitative method, Deltachi(2) (1 d.f.)=15.1 (P=0.0001), overall survival chi(2)=10.85 (P=0.001). Ki-67 is a powerful biomarker in localised prostate cancer and adds to a model predicting the need for radical or conservative therapy. As it is already in widespread use in routine pathology, it is confirmed as the most promising biomarker to be applied into routine practice.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: Androgen ablation is the standard treatment for recurrent and metastatic prostate cancer. Surprisingly few studies have documented the specific results for local and distant failure in patients treated primarily with radiation or radical prostatectomy. We report the long-term outcome of a series of those patients. Materials and methods: We followed until death 94 patients in whom primary radiation therapy failed and 67 in whom radical prostatectomy failed. All patients received androgen ablation. Results: Statistically (p = 0.04) more patients in the radiation group (78%) died of prostate cancer than in the radical prostatectomy group (63%). Of the radiation group with local failure alone 63%, died of prostate cancer at a median of 5.03 years. Of the surgery group with isolated local failure 50% died of cancer at a median of 9.83 years. Of the patients treated with radiation with distant metastasis 93% died of cancer with a median time to death of 2.34 years. Of the patients treated with surgery 69% died of prostate cancer at a median of 3.27 years. The differences in survival between the 2 groups was significant. Conclusions: This study is unique in providing followup until death of patients treated with radical prostatectomy and radiation who had clinical failure and were treated with androgen ablation. Compelling is the finding that survival after androgen ablation after surgical failure is superior to that for radiation. If confirmed, this would be a significant consideration for future studies of patients in whom primary therapy fails.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is in critical need of new and innovative treatment strategies. Since the approval of sipuleucel-T, the investigatory climate of prostate cancer immunotherapy has been rapidly evolving with promising developments in vaccine and immune checkpoint therapies. Recent findings: Sipuleucel-T remains the first and only therapeutic cancer vaccine approved for its survival benefit in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Additional cancer vaccines are currently being evaluated, with the most promising being a peptide vaccine encoding prostate-specific antigen, known as prostate-specific antigen-TRICOM. Emerging data supports combinatorial strategies for vaccine therapy and a potential role for implementation in earlier stages of advanced disease. Immune checkpoint therapies have demonstrated limited success in prostate cancer with negative late phase trials for ipilimumab monotherapy and discouraging early phase results for programmed cell death protein 1 blockade. Novel immune-modulatory targets and rational combination strategies aim to produce more favorable results. Recent progress has been made to determine biologic predictors for response and toxicity in prostate cancer immunotherapy aiming to improve patient selection and safety. Summary: Steady progress is anticipated in the field of prostate cancer immunotherapy including ongoing development of novel cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint therapies, and combinatorial strategies.",prostate cancer
"Biopsy materials obtained in the American Cancer Society National Prostate Cancer Detection Project were reviewed at the Central Pathology Laboratory at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Of 265 cases submitted, 177 were diagnosed as prostatic carcinoma, 7 as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), 13 as atypical glands or atypical hyperplasia, and the remaining 68 were benign hyperplasias. Irrespective of the means of detectin or the grading system used (Gleason or WHO-Mostofi), a large majority of the cancers were detected as low-grade tumors. Of 27 cases of PIN reported, 20 were associated with cancer, leaving 7 cases with the sole diagnosis of PIN. These data may indicate the increased use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination (DRE), and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) in the United States is shifting the spectrum of prostate cancer pathology toward early low-grade tumors.",prostate cancer
"Discriminating patients with a low risk of progression from those with lethal prostate cancer is one of the main challenges in prostate cancer management. Indeed, such discrimination is essential if we aim to avoid overtreatment in men with indolent disease and to improve survival in those men with lethal disease. We are reporting on the current literature on such prognostic tools that are now available, their clinical role and their limitations in individualizing care. There is an urgent need to incorporate such genomic tools into new platform-based clinical trial structures to further develop and validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers and provide prostate cancer patients with an effective and cost-efficient access to new drugs in the setting of personalized treatment.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: To summarize the current understanding of the natural history and molecular biology of low-risk prostate cancer, and review the indications for surveillance and focal therapy. Recent findings: Low-risk prostate cancer, diagnosed in 40-50% of newly diagnosed men in a screened population, represents overdiagnosis in most cases. Gleason pattern 3 cells typically lack the molecular machinery and the genetic abnormalities, which characterize true cancers, with two important caveats. Thirty percent of patients diagnosed with low-risk prostate based on a systematic biopsy cancer harbor higher-grade cancer that is unrepresented on the biopsy. Secondly, a very small minority harbor prehistologic molecular alterations that result in progression to more aggressive disease. Favorable-risk prostate cancer is better viewed as one of multiple risk factors for the presence of higher-grade prostate cancer, and should be managed with close follow-up. Radical intervention should be reserved for clear evidence of more aggressive disease. Focal therapy should be offered to men with higher-risk disease either at baseline, as an alternative to whole gland radiation or surgery or when active surveillance 'fails' (the patient transitions from low risk to higher risk). The two strategies should be seen as complimentary elements of care that can be applied in a risk-stratified manner - taking account of patient preference - from the outset or in sequence Summary: Active surveillance is appropriate for most men with low-risk prostate cancer, and focal therapy may complement active surveillance for those men wishing to continue a tissue-preserving strategy.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer in men. A discovery of major importance in the endocrinology of prostate cancer is that the testes contribute only 60% of total androgens in adult men; the remaining 40% are synthesized in peripheral tissues, including the normal and cancerous prostate, from inactive androgen precursors of adrenal origin. Using a combination therapy that includes a pure blocker of the androgen receptor or antiandrogen and castration (medical with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist or surgical by orchiectomy), the duration of response and survival have been demonstrated to be prolonged for the first time in advanced prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Investigations on androgen signaling alterations in the late stages of prostate cancer revealed new molecular mechanisms that may be in part responsible for failure of endocrine therapy. Both primary and metastatic lesions from prostate cancer express androgen receptor protein. Amplification of androgen receptor gene occurs in a subset of prostate cancer patients. Several point mutations of androgen receptor gene have been described; they generate receptors which are functionally activated by androgens, other steroids, and even by antihormones. The frequency of androgen receptor mutations may be high in tumor metastases. Functional activity of androgen receptor is influenced by nonsteroidal factors, such as peptide growth factors and second messengers. Thus, prostate cancer cells adapt to low androgen environment by various mechanisms utilizing androgen receptor. Therefore, new strategies for switching off the androgen receptor are needed.",prostate cancer
"One in eight men in the UK will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. The risk of prostate cancer is strongly age-related and is also linked with a Western lifestyle. Other risk factors include Afro-Caribbean ethnic origin and a positive family history. The more first-degree relatives affected the greater the risk of developing the disease. More than 70 familial prostate cancer susceptibility genes, including the important breast cancer gene BRCA2, have now been identified. A suspicion of a diagnosis of prostate cancer is usually based on either induration or nodularity of the prostate on digital rectal examination or, more commonly, a rise in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level. The usual cut-off point for PSA is taken as 4 ng/ml, but in men below 65 a value of more than 2.5 ng/ml should raise suspicion. A progressive rise in PSA over time may also indicate the possibility of the presence of a cancer within the prostate. When prostate cancer is suspected, increasingly urologists are requesting multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the gland before deciding whether or not a biopsy is indicated. The Gleason grading of any cancer identified is an important part of the decision-making process concerning the need for active treatment, as opposed to surveillance alone. Gleason pattern 6 cancers are regarded as low risk, Gleason 7 intermediate risk and 8-10 high risk. In patients diagnosed with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer further investigations are required to determine the local extent of the disease and to exclude the presence of metastases.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: The aim of this article is to review novel MRI and nuclear medicine methods for detecting and planning salvage treatment for prostate cancer local recurrence after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. Recent findings: Traditional methods for detecting local recurrence (i.e., digital rectal exam or transrectal ultrasound and digital rectal exam or transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy) have limited accuracy in determining the presence and extent of local recurrence and therefore have limited ability to guide salvage therapy. Recent studies indicate that conventional T1 and T2-weighted prostate MRI could improve the detection of recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and salvage treatment planning. Promising new sequences could further increase the accuracy of MRI. In addition, the use of technically improved PET/computed tomography scanners with new tracers like (11)C and (18)F choline and acetate might offer better assessment of recurrent prostate cancer than (18)F-2-fluoro-D-deoxyglucose-PET and monoclonal antibody imaging with the prostate specific membrane antigen antibody (111)In-capromab pendetide (ProstaScint). Summary: With systemic therapies for recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy being noncurative, the application of MRI and nuclear medicine modalities can help to identify patients who have isolated local recurrence amenable to salvage treatment.",prostate cancer
"The androgen receptor (AR) is a master regulator transcription factor in normal and cancerous prostate cells. Canonical AR activation requires binding of androgen ligand to the AR ligand binding domain, translocation to the nucleus, and transcriptional activation of AR target genes. This regulatory axis is targeted for systemic therapy of advanced prostate cancer. However, a new paradigm for AR activation in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has emerged wherein alternative splicing of AR mRNA promotes synthesis of constitutively active AR variants that lack the AR ligand binding domain (LBD). Recent work has indicated that structural alteration of the AR gene locus represents a key mechanism by which alterations in AR mRNA splicing arise. In this review, we examine the role of truncated AR variants (ARVs) and their corresponding genomic origins in models of prostate cancer progression, as well as the challenges they pose to the current standard of prostate cancer therapies targeting the AR ligand binding domain. Since ARVs lack the COOH-terminal LBD, the genesis of these AR gene rearrangements and their resulting ARVs provides strong rationale for the pursuit of new avenues of therapeutic intervention targeted at the AR NH2-terminal domain. We further suggest that genomic events leading to ARV expression could act as novel biomarkers of disease progression that may guide the optimal use of current and next-generation AR-targeted therapy.",prostate cancer
"The old concept of androgen depletion therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer, which had been established on the basis of clinical experiences essentially on the far advanced disease, should be changed. The recent major increase in the diagnosis of localized and locally advanced prostate cancer due to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening prompts us to make clear the role of ADT for such an early stage of prostate cancer. Recent literature has proved that combination therapy of castration (medical or surgical) and non-steroidal anti-androgens (maximal androgen blockade, MAB, or combined androgen blockade, CAB) is markedly effective on non-metastatic prostate cancer. It is important to promote basic and clinical research based on the understanding that cure of prostate cancer is almost always possible with ADT if progression to the hormone-independent prostate cancer which accompanies metastatic disease can be avoided.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the number one malignancy among men. The search for causative factors has proven to be difficult and, accordingly, treatment options for advanced prostate cancer remain limited. However, technologic breakthroughs in the fields of genetics and molecular biology have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms involved in prostate carcinogenesis. The aim of this article is to review the most recent evidence for the role of various genetic insults at specific steps in tumor formation and to suggest potential therapeutic targets.",prostate cancer
"Metastatic changes secondary to prostate cancer usually occur in bones, less commonly in pelvic lymph nodes, liver, lungs, urinary balder and brain. Less common localization includes skin, testis and other structures. The current paper reports a rare case of metastatic infiltration of the dura mater in patient with prostate cancer (Gleason 8 (4+4)) with disseminated bone metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an advance infiltration of dura mater of anterior and posterior cranial fossa without any neoplasmatic-related changes in brain. Along optic nerves it penetrated to the optic canal and right orbit.",prostate cancer
"This review, based on published papers, aims to describe the costs of prostate cancer screening and to examine whether prostate cancer screening is cost effective. The estimated cost per cancer detected ranged from €1299 in The Netherlands to US$44,355 in the USA. The estimated cost per life-year saved ranged from US$3000 to US$729,000, while the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was AU$291,817 and Can$371,100. The most appropriate data for economic evaluation of prostate cancer screening should be the cost per QALY gained. The estimated costs per QALY gained by prostate cancer screening were significantly higher than the cost-effectiveness threshold, suggesting that even when based on favorable randomized controlled trials in younger age groups, prostate cancer screening is still not cost effective.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is now becoming an emerging health priority in East Asia. Most of our current knowledge on Prostate cancer has been generated from studies conducted in Western population; however, there is considerable heterogeneity of Prostate cancer between East and West. In this article, we reviewed epidemiologic trends, risk factors, disease characteristics and management of Prostate cancer in East Asian population over the last decade. Growing evidence from East Asia suggests an important role of genetic and environmental risk factors interactions in the carcinogenesis of Prostate cancer. Exposure to westernized diet and life style and improvement in health care in combination contribute substantially to the increasing epidemic in this region. Diagnostic and treatment guidelines in East Asia are largely based on Western knowledge. Although there is a remarkable improvement in the outcome over the last decade, ample evidence suggests an inneglectable difference in diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy and adverse events between different populations. The knowledge from western countries should be calibrated in the Asian setting to provide a better race-based treatment approach. In this review, we intend to reveal the evolving trend of Prostate cancer in the last decade, in order to gain evidence to improve Prostate cancer prevention and control in East Asia.",prostate cancer
"In a national register-based study of incidence trends and mortality of incidental prostate cancer in Sweden, we found that a significant proportion (26.6%) of affected men diagnosed died of their disease, which challenges earlier descriptions of incidental prostate cancer as a non-lethal disease.",prostate cancer
"The intermediate and long-term results of primary full-gland cryoablation for localized prostate cancer with moderate- and high-risk patients suggests a cancer control rate similar to what can be achieved with radiotherapy and surgery, with an acceptable rate of complications. A recent shift in the treatment paradigm toward unilateral cryoablation (hemiablation) or ablation of unifocal lesion(s) in select patients suggests the ability of this approach to maintain a quality of life closer to the pretreatment level. However, trials with longer oncologic follow-up are needed. The development of more accurate imaging-based techniques-ie, image-guided prostate biopsy sampling and image-guided prostate cryoablation-is of paramount importance to selecting appropriate candidates for an organ-sparing procedure. To make this approach scientifically sound, further investigation to establish patient selection criteria, the development of molecular and imaging parameters of cryoablative efficacy, and regular careful follow-up of these patients is needed.",prostate cancer
"External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for the treatment of loco-regional prostate cancer yields similar survival rates to radical prostatectomy (10-year survival: 90-95%, 60-70% and 50-60% in T1, T2 and T3-stages, respectively). Post-operative radiotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer may improve the local and distant disease-free survival of patients. Using the recently developed technology of the 3D-conformal RT and of the intensity-modulated RT (IMRT), the focalized administration of a higher radiation dose is allowed keeping exposure of surrounding normal tissues to low levels. Cytoprotection with amifostine administration before EBRT fractions may reduce the incidence of early and late radiation sequel from the bladder and rectum. The developments in radiobiology suggest that large radiotherapy fractions may be more efficacious than standard radiotherapy, so that hypofractionation of radiotherapy may further improve local control rates. The use of interstitial high-dose rate implants to boost the prostate after an initial course of EBRT has been applied successfully in various institutes, with further improvement of the results obtained with EBRT. Chemotherapeutic agents, such as docetaxel and liposomal doxorubicin, as well as novel biological agents introduced into clinical practice (i.e. anti-erbB, anti-angiogenic and apoptosis-modulating agents) have shown significant radiosensitizing activity and deserve clinical evaluation in conjunction with radiotherapy.",prostate cancer
"To evaluate the present status of prostate cancer in patients 75 years of age or older, we reviewed clinical characteristics of prostate cancer in patients from the Kitamurayama Hospital. The number of symptomatic advanced cases was greater in patients > or = 75 years old compared with patients < or = 74 years old. However, no significant difference in cause-specific survival rate was found between the two groups. In the cases examined, the difference in biological characteristics between groups did not affect the prognosis. On the other hand, for patients > or = 75 years old, improvement of urinary retention was low, and the incidence of adverse drug responses to endocrine therapy, such as dementia and thrombosis, was high. We recognize the necessity of a comprehensive medical plan that attaches importance to quality of life and safety for the treatment of patients over 75 years old with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The objective of the study was to address some important questions related to prostate cancer treatments and survivorship. One of possibility to improve the survival probability of prostate cancer patients is to improve predictive strategies. Therefore in this article was created short-term multistep ahead predictive model for survival probability prediction of prostate cancer patients. Neuro-fuzzy model was used to select the most important inputs for the predictive model. As the inputs, current and time lagged variables were used. The results could be useful for simplification of predictive models to avoid multiple inputs.",prostate cancer
"Clinical outcome of patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) at diagnosis is heterogeneous and unpredictable; thus alternative treatments such as immunotherapy are investigated. We retrospectively analyzed natural killer (NK) cells by flow cytometry in peripheral blood from 39 mPC patients, with 5 year-follow-up, and their correlation with time to castration resistance (TCR) and overall survival (OS). In parallel, NK functionality was carried out against prostate tumor cell lines, analyzed for the expression of NK cell ligands, to identify the receptors involved in PC recognition. NK cells from patients with longer TCR and OS displayed high expression of activating receptors and high cytotoxicity. The activating receptors NKp30 and NKp46 were the most obvious predictive markers of OS and TCR in a larger cohort of mPC patients (OS: p= 0.0018 and 0.0009; TCR: p= 0.007 and < 0.0001 respectively, log-rank test). Importantly, blocking experiments revealed that NKp46, along with NKG2D and DNAM-1 and, to a lesser extent NKp30, were involved in prostate tumor recognition by NK cells. These results identify NK cells as potential predictive biomarkers to stratify patients who are likely to have longer castration response, and pave the way to explore therapies aimed at enhancing NK cells in mPC patients.",prostate cancer
"The incidence of prostate cancer increases with age. Current evidence suggests that prostate cancer is under treated in patients aged ≥70 years, despite evidence of efficacy and acceptable toxicity. Radical cystectomy and definitive radiotherapy are often denied owing to fears of post-operative complications and radiotherapy-associated gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity. However, modern radical prostatectomy techniques provide excellent clinical outcomes with low perioperative morbidity. Moreover, volume-restricted intensity-modulated radiation therapy is a significant improvement over previous 2D conformal radiotherapy with similar efficacy and lower toxicity. Androgen-deprivation therapy is also under-prescribed among the elderly, owing to concerns of increases in cardiac deaths and osteoporosis acceleration. However, prospective trials have not identified any increase in cardiovascular mortality among elderly men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy compared to age-matched controls. Most patients on androgen deprivation eventually progress to a castration-resistant state. At this stage, the disease still responds to newer agents that target the androgen pathway and to chemotherapy. Among the elderly, chemotherapy is under-prescribed even though it has been demonstrated to be palliative and improve survival. We describe the trends in prostate cancer management in the elderly and the importance of assessing comorbidity status, tumour characteristics, and health status, including a complete geriatric evaluation, before making treatment recommendations.",prostate cancer
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are effective regulators of gene expression that have a significant role in the pathogenesis of prostate and various other cancers. The high prevalence of aberrant miRNA expression in prostate cancer, and miRNAs' distinctive properties, give much hope that they can be used as biomarkers and next generation of molecular anticancer therapeutics. Herein, we review the literature on miRNA involvement in prostate cancer pathogenesis and the current understanding of their role as oncogenes, tumor suppressors and metastasis-regulators. We also review the latest research on miRNAs in prostate cancer preclinical studies and clinical trials, and highlight the advantages and challenges of possible miRNA-based therapies. The emerging information regarding the biology of miRNAs in prostate cancer is promising, and may lead to a role(s) for these molecules as diagnostic/prognostic markers and effective therapeutic tools for better molecularly targeted treatment of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: Men with a family history of prostate cancer are at higher risk for prostate cancer. There are conflicting data regarding the impact of hereditary forms of prostate cancer on long-term outcomes after radical prostatectomy. We examined the impact of familial and hereditary prostate cancer treatment in the prostate specific antigen era. Materials and methods: Patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer from 1987 to 1997 were surveyed (3,560 responders) to determine the family history of prostate cancer. Patients were categorized as having familial prostate cancer if they had at least 1 first-degree relative with prostate cancer. Hereditary prostate cancer was defined as nuclear families with 3 cases of prostate cancer, families with prostate cancer in each of 3 generations and families with 2 men diagnosed before age 55 years. Sporadic prostate cancer was defined as patients with no family history. Clinical and pathological features, and long-term outcome measures, including biochemical recurrence-free, systemic progression-free and cancer specific survival, were compared among patients with familial, hereditary and sporadic prostate cancer. Results: A total of 865 and 133 patients were categorized as having familial prostate cancer and hereditary prostate cancer, respectively. Preoperatively prostate specific antigen was higher in patients with hereditary prostate cancer than in the other 2 groups (p = 0.04). Ten-year biochemical progression-free, systemic progression-free and cancer specific survival were equivalent. Conclusions: Except for preoperative prostate specific antigen, clinicopathological features and long-term oncological outcomes are equivalent after radical prostatectomy in patients with familial, hereditary and sporadic prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Objectives: Men with localized high-risk prostate cancer carry significant risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality. The best treatment approach to minimize this risk is unclear. In this review, we evaluate the role of radiation before and after radical prostatectomy. Methods and materials: A critical review of the literature was performed regarding the application of external radiation therapy (RT) in combination with prostatectomy for high-risk localized prostate cancer. Results: Up to 70% of men with high-risk localized disease may require adjuvant therapy because of adverse pathologic features or biochemical recurrence in the absence of systemic disease. The utility of adjuvant RT among men with adverse pathologic features are well established at least regarding minimizing biochemical recurrence risk. The optimal timing of salvage radiation is the subject of ongoing studies. Neoadjuvant RT requires further study but is a potentially attractive method because of decreased radiation field sizes and potential radiobiologic benefits of delivering RT before surgery. Salvage prostatectomy is effective at treating local recurrence after radiation but is associated with significant surgical morbidity. Conclusions: Combining local therapies including radical prostatectomy and RT can be a reasonable approach. Care should be taken at the initial presentation of high-risk localized prostate cancer to consider and plan for the likelihood of multimodality care.",prostate cancer
"Each of the three most common contemporary treatments for localized prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, and brachytherapy, can have adverse effects on sexual health. Sexual health outcome can be improved by treatment-specific factors, such as the use of nerve-sparing technique during radical prostatectomy, or worsened by the use of androgen deprivation before external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy. Contemporary studies that have used validated questionnaires to evaluate multiple components of patient-reported sexuality following prostate cancer treatments provide benchmarks of sexual outcome expectations that are of interest to patients selecting their prostate cancer treatment.",prostate cancer
"Objective: To examine prevalence and predictors of cancer-specific distress in undiagnosed men with and without a family history of prostate cancer, and to examine the contribution of perceptions of an affected relative's cancer experience on the distress of unaffected male relatives. Methods: Men with a first degree relative with prostate cancer (n = 207) and men without a family history (n = 239) from Australia completed a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview. Participants completed the Prostate Cancer Anxiety Subscale of the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer, measures of perceived risk, and socio-demographic information. Men with a family history provided details about their family history (number of relatives diagnosed with and dead from prostate cancer, relationship to affected relative, months since diagnosis) and reported their perceptions of their affected relative's prostate cancer experience including perceptions of threat related to the relative's diagnosis and perceived treatment phase and prognosis. Results: Cancer-specific distress was low for all men and there was no significant difference in the distress experienced by men with and without a family history. Regression analyses showed that for all men, cancer-specific distress increased with urinary symptoms and decreased in those with higher education and in older participants. For men with a family history, having a relative who died from prostate cancer and perceiving greater threat from a relative's diagnosis was associated with greater cancer-specific distress. Conclusions: Interventions would benefit from examining appraisals of familial risk and examining prospective assessments of distress in the unaffected male relatives of men with prostate cancer over the course of the cancer trajectory.",prostate cancer
"Predictive factors stratify cancer patients into homogeneous groups for treatment. There is an acute need for accurate predictive factors in patients with prostate cancer given the marked variation in treatment recommendations. These factors should be obtained prior to therapy and should include patient factors, serum factors and tissue-specific factors derived from biopsies. This review evaluates the current state of knowledge regarding quantitative methods in prostate tissue specimens, classifying predictive factors in prostate cancer into four categories. The first category, predictive factors recommended for widespread clinical use, includes Gleason grade; nontissue markers include clinical stage and serum prostate-specific antigen. The second category, predictive factors that are often collected but of unproven significance, includes DNA ploidy and volume of cancerous material in the needle biopsy. The third category, predictive factors not used for routine patient management, includes cell proliferation markers (mitotic figures, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Ki-67 and MIB-1), apoptotic markers, microvessel density and perineural invasion. The fourth category, predictive factors under investigation, includes morphometric features, such as nuclear roundness and size, chromatin texture, silver-staining nucleolar organizer regions and nucleolar size. Standards are required for virtually every aspect of morphometric study, and these features require validation before their acceptance as clinically relevant in prostate cancer. Predictive factors in radical prostatectomies include cancer volume and extent in radical prostatectomy specimens and quantitation of number and size of lymph node metastases. Neural network models provide greater accuracy for combinations of predictive factors than traditional statistical methods of analysis, such as logistic regression and Cox models, and are expected to be incorporated into routine use in the next few years.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer co-opts a unique set of cellular pathways in its initiation and progression. The heterogeneity of prostate cancers is evident at earlier stages, and has led to rigorous efforts to stratify the localized prostate cancers, so that progression to advanced stages could be predicted based upon salient features of the early disease. The deregulated androgen receptor signaling is undeniably most important in the progression of the majority of prostate tumors. It is perhaps because of the primacy of the androgen receptor governed transcriptional program in prostate epithelium cells that once this program is corrupted, the consequences of the ensuing changes in activity are pleotropic and could contribute to malignancy in multiple ways. Following localized surgical and radiation therapies, 20-40% of patients will relapse and progress, and will be treated with androgen deprivation therapies. The successful development of the new agents that inhibit androgen signaling has changed the progression free survival in hormone resistant disease, but this has not changed the almost ubiquitous development of truly resistant phenotypes in advanced prostate cancer. This review summarizes the current understanding of the molecular pathways involved in localized and metastatic prostate cancer, with an emphasis on the clinical implications of the new knowledge.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: We compared the effectiveness of PCA3 (prostate cancer antigen 3) and select comparators for improving initial or repeat biopsy decision making in men at risk for prostate cancer, or treatment choices in men with prostate cancer. Materials and methods: MEDLINE®, EMBASE®, Cochrane Database and gray literature were searched from January 1990 through May 2012. Included studies were matched, and measured PCA3 and comparator(s) within a cohort. No matched analyses were possible. Differences in independent performance estimates between PCA3 and comparators were computed within studies. Studies were assessed for quality using QUADAS (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) and for strength of evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria. Results: Among 1,556 publications identified, 34 observational studies were analyzed (24 addressed diagnostic accuracy and 13 addressed treatment decisions). Most studies were conducted in opportunistic cohorts of men referred for procedures and were not designed to answer key questions. Two study biases (partial verification and sampling) were addressed by analyses, allowing some conclusions to be drawn. PCA3 was more discriminatory than total prostate specific antigen increases (eg at an observed 50% specificity, summary sensitivities were 77% and 57%, respectively). Analyses indicated that this finding holds for initial and repeat biopsies, and that the markers were independent predictors. For all other biopsy decision making comparisons and associated health outcomes, strength of evidence was insufficient. For treatment decision making, strength of evidence was insufficient for all outcomes and comparators. Conclusions: PCA3 had a higher diagnostic accuracy than total prostate specific antigen increases, but strength of evidence was low (limited confidence in effect estimates). Strength of evidence was insufficient to conclude that PCA3 testing leads to improved health outcomes. For all other outcomes and comparators, strength of evidence was insufficient.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer affects an increasing number of men worldwide and is a leading cause of cancer-associated deaths. Beside genetic mutations, many epigenetic alterations including DNA and histone modifications have been identified in clinical prostate tumor samples. They have been linked to aberrant activity of enzymes and reader proteins involved in these epigenetic processes, leading to the search for dedicated inhibitory compounds. In the wake of encouraging anti-tumor efficacy results in preclinical models, epigenetic modulators addressing different targets are now being tested in prostate cancer patients. In addition, the assessment of microRNAs as stratification biomarkers, and early clinical trials evaluating suppressor microRNAs as potential prostate cancer treatment are being discussed.",prostate cancer
"Prostatic multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) has recently had a wide development becoming a key tool in the diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in prostate cancer (Pca). The fast development both in technology and in reading (PIRADS V2) requires a continuous updating of knowledge within this area. The aim of this article is to present an updated revision of technical aspects, reading patterns and prostatic MP-MRI in Pca, with a multidisciplinary approach. Currently guidelines establish the use of the MP-MRI when there is a high PSA and a negative prostatic biopsy; tumor staging; evaluation in candidates to active surveillance; focal treatments plans and tumoral recurrence evaluation. Although it is used in other indications in some centers, like its use in patients suspicious of Pca but with no previous biopsy, there is still the need of a cost/benefit assessment for its use to be wider.",prostate cancer
Prostate cancer is the most frequent tumor found in men worldwide and in Mexico in particular. Age and family history are the main risk factors. The diagnosis is made by prostate biopsy in patients with abnormalities detected in their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels or digital rectal exam (DRE).

"In improving the management of prostate cancer, cryotherapy, interstitial laser ablation and high intensity focused ultrasound may prove to be preferable to radical prostatectomy. For patients with advanced, metastatic or recurrent disease, the mainstay of therapy is likely to remain combined androgen blockage, that is the use of a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone analogue and antiandrogen combination. Other possible new therapeutic advances include the use of growth factor inhibitors such as suramin in hormone escaped prostate cancer and the use of gene therapy. In conclusion, the best hopes for managing prostate cancer lie in earlier detection of the disease, and there is a need for improved diagnostic indicators. It is also important, as a general principle, to increase the efficacy and reduce the morbidity of therapies. However, increased survival is not the only issue as improvements in quality of life are fundamental in patients with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) recurrence after therapy with curative intent currently depends primarily on biochemical serum analyses. When recurrence is suspected, further treatment decisions rely heavily on the confirmation of disease presence and determination of its extent. This is complicated by the fact that benign conditions can mimic biochemical recurrence, and serum studies do not reliably discriminate between local and distant recurrence. This review discusses the contemporary imaging paradigm for the evaluation of local PCa recurrence. The multidisciplinary implications for urologists, radiation oncologists and radiologists are examined. Emerging techniques and future directions of PCa imaging research are discussed.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: We investigated the expression of metallothionein in human prostate cancer. Materials and methods: Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue specimens from 45 patients with primary prostate cancer were stained for metallothionein using a standard immunohistochemical technique. Results: Metallothionein was detected in 15 of 45 prostate cancers (33.3%). Cytoplasmic and nuclear staining occurred in most cells. Additionally, metallothionein was found in basement membrane surrounding the cancer cells in 2 cases with metallothionein expression, and in secretory products of the lumen in a few cases. Statistical analysis for metallothionein expression related to tumor grade revealed a significant difference between high (7 to 10) and low (2 to 4) Gleason scores (p < 0.001), as well as between middle (5 and 6) and low scores (p < 0.05). However, no relationship was found with clinical stage. Conclusions: Our data suggest a close correlation of metallothionein expression with tumor grade and a wide range of metallothionein expression in prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men in the Western world. In North America, more than 275,000 men are diagnosed annually, whereby approximately 1 in 6 men will be diagnosed with CaP in their lifetime, and 1 in 34 men will die from castration-resistant metastatic disease. Unfortunately, current clinical prognostic factors explain only a proportion of the observed variation in clinical outcome from patient to patient. Furthermore, overtreatment of indolent and low-risk cancers leads to inappropriate morbidity following radiotherapy or surgery. As such, better predictors of individualized prognosis and treatment response are urgently needed to triage patients to customized and intensified CaP treatment. Recent developments in next-generation sequencing have made it possible to identify prognostic and predictive signatures based on genomic profiles. We discuss the genetic basis of CaP progression from localized to systemic disease (e.g., point mutations, copy-number alterations, and structural variants) in relation with unique features of CaP biology, including intraprostatic and interprostatic heterogeneity, multifocality and multiclonality, TMPRSS2:ERG, and other ETS-family gene fusions. Finally, we focus on the use of genomic markers as prognostic factors for local failure and for systemic disease, as novel risk-stratification tools, in triaging patients to existing treatment options, and ultimately the potential of genomics for the identification of molecular targets for therapy of CaP.",prostate cancer
"Many controversies surround the management of prostate cancer to include screening practices, diagnosis, and treatment options. The lack of randomized prospective studies comparing the various definitive treatment modalities currently available occasionally can make the decision process challenging for patients and their providers. In this setting of controversy, the cost of treating clinically localized prostate cancer is significant. In the face of these unanswered questions, this article summarizes some important principles regarding the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. This review is limited to the diagnosis and management of clinically localized disease.",prostate cancer
"Tea may be a potentially modifiable and highly prevalent risk factor for the most common cancer in men, prostate cancer. However, associations between black tea consumption and prostate cancer in epidemiological studies have been inconsistent, limited to a small number of studies with small numbers of cases and short follow-up periods and without grade-specific information. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 6,016 men who were enrolled in the Collaborative Cohort Study between 1970 and 1973 and followed up to December 31, 2007. We used Cox proportional hazards models to investigate the association between tea consumption and overall as well as grade-specific risk of prostate cancer incidence. Three hundred and eighteen men developed prostate cancer in up to 37 years of follow-up. We found a positive association between consumption of tea and overall risk of prostate cancer incidence (P = 0.02). The association was greatest among men who drank ≥ 7 cups of tea per day (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.06 to 2.12), compared with the baseline of 0-3 cups/day. However, we did not find any significant association between tea intake and low- (Gleason <7) or high-grade (Gleason 8-10) prostate cancer incidence. Men with higher intake of tea are at greater risk of developing prostate cancer, but there is no association with more aggressive disease. Further research is needed to determine the underlying biological mechanisms for the association.",prostate cancer

"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRSI) are emerging as the most sensitive tools for the non-invasive, anatomic and metabolic evaluation of prostate cancer. This article reviews the current applications of MRI and 1H MRSI in clinical practice and discusses the promise of these modalities for improving prostate cancer management. MRI demonstrates zonal anatomy with excellent contrast resolution and can reveal tumours in areas not routinely sampled on biopsy and not palpable on digital rectal examination. In addition, MR images allow assessment of local extent (including extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion) and thus can assist in local staging while providing surgeons and radiation therapists with a visual road-map for treatment planning. The addition of 1H MRSI to MRI can improve prostate cancer detection and assessment of tumour volume; it also contributes indirectly to improved local staging. In addition, 1H MRSI metabolic and volumetric data correlate with pathological Gleason grade and thus may offer a non-invasive means to better predict prostate cancer aggressiveness. Combined MRI/1H MRSI is currently of greatest value for high-risk patients. With greater understanding of the relationship between spectroscopic data and tumour biology, it may become possible to use MRI/1H MRSI to achieve more precise stratification of patients in clinical trials, to monitor the progress of patients who select watchful waiting or minimally aggressive cancer therapies, and to guide and assess emerging local prostate cancer therapies.",prostate cancer
"Objectives: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the three domains bowel, urinary, and sexual function as they were measured in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study and examine their use in different research and practice settings. Leading prostate cancer health-related quality-of-life questionnaires include questions that measure patients' bowel, urinary, and sexual function and their perceived annoyance (or bother) caused by limited functioning. The published results are mixed on reporting function and bother independently or together as a single domain. Methods: Statistical tools from classical measurement theory and factor analytic methods were used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study disease-specific scales. The findings from studies of other prostate cancer outcomes scales and clinical input were included to formulate the conclusions. Results: Factor analysis results uncovered a multidimensional structure within two of the three domains. The urinary domain consisted of items measuring two factors: incontinence and urinary obstructive symptoms. Sexual dysfunction consisted of two dimensions: interest in sexual activity and erectile function. Conclusions: These empirical results suggest that bowel dysfunction and urinary incontinence can each be combined with measures of bother to produce overall measures of function; however, evidence was present for the need for separate measures of sexual function, sexual interest, and perceived bother with sexual function. For informing patient-doctor communications, function and bother on all three domains should be reported separately, because treatment decisions or symptom management may vary depending on a patient's perceived concern about their health-related quality-of-life.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States. Unfortunately, at the current time, no curative treatments are available for metastatic prostate cancer. As is the case for most solid tumors, the recruitment of blood vessels (angiogenesis) is key for the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer. Inhibition of this process is an attractive approach to treatment. Many antiangiogenic agents are currently in clinical development. The following discussion will outline the importance of angiogenesis in the metastasis and progression of prostate cancer, summarize the current surrogate markers of angiogenesis available for the drug development of antiangiogenic agents, and review examples of investigational agents that target tumor angiogenesis (e.g., TNP-470, Thalidomide, CC5013, Carboxyamido-triazole (CAI), Endostatin. SU5416, SU6668, Bevacizumab (Anti-VEGFrhuMAb), and 2-Methoxyestradiol).",prostate cancer
"PSA, DRE, and TRUS sector biopsy have been used clinically internationally for almost two decades and have been available in New Zealand since 1993. The incidence of prostate cancer has approximately doubled. Many countries especially in Western Europe, North America and including Australia report decreases in prostate cancer mortality due to this change ranging from 10 to 39%. This has not so far occurred in New Zealand, however, and likely reasons for this are discussed. They include a negative approach encouraged by the New Zealand Guidelines Group and others, and more difficult access to investigations and treatments for New Zealand men than other countries. Technological advances in TRUS sector biopsy, histological diagnosis, and management are discussed. Changes in international prostate cancer mortality data and results from several clinical trials are also discussed. It is concluded that the weight of evidence in favour of PSA/DRE testing is now overwhelming and that potentially between 200 and 300 of the 600 men who currently die of prostate cancer in New Zealand could be saved by the application of current technology.",prostate cancer
"Chronic inflammation has been associated with resulting in malignancies in prostate cancer patients. In the May 2005 issue of Clinical Cancer Research, a study by Wang et al. demonstrates a relationship between COX-2 expression and the local chronic inflammation within prostate cancer and the increased angiogenesis. Confirming the existence and extent of this relationship is essential in the determination of therapeutic modalities for the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Proton therapy is a promising, but costly, treatment for prostate cancer. Theoretical physical advantages exist; yet to date, it has been shown only to be comparably safe and effective when compared with the alternatives and not necessarily superior. If clinically meaningful benefits do exist for patients, more rigorous study will be needed to detect them and society will require this to justify the investment of time and money. New technical advances in proton beam delivery coupled with shortened overall treatment times and declining device costs have the potential to make this a more cost-effective therapy in the years ahead.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a common malignant tumor of the elderly, which accounts for a significant proportion of total morbidity but very low of mortality. In Croatia, it is the second most common cancer in men. Currently, there are many doubts concerning screening, early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. Therefore, this article brings results of Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs) on the topic of prostate cancer published in the last eight years. In June 2016, Cochrane database of systematic reviews was searched using the following keywords: Systematic Reviews, and Prostate Cancer (Malignancy, Neoplasm). Inclusion criterion was publication date of the Cochrane SR or its update in the last eight years. The abstracts were initially screened and those that matched the topic were included in further analysis. Then full texts of all SRs involved were obtained. SRs were classified into four topics: prevention, screening, treatment and psychosocial aspects. Our search retrieved a total of 19 Cochrane SRs on the topic of prostate cancer. Excluded were four articles that did not match the specific topic, and the remaining 15 full texts were obtained. One of these was on screening, two on prevention, the majority, i.e. eleven were on treatment, and one on the psychosocial aspects related to prostate cancer. Based on the results of the Cochrane SRs on prostate cancer, instead of mass/population screening, the individualized/opportunistic screening approach should be applied in men aged 55-69, always providing full information to the patient and taking into account the potential benefits and harms of this procedure.",prostate cancer
"Evidence is mounting indicating that screening for prostate cancer is rational and appropriate. More information is necessary to define the optimal ages at which screening should be performed and to determine the appropriate role of PSA, PSA velocity, and PSA density in serial screening. Formal demonstration of a significant screening-induced reduction in cancer-specific morbidity and mortality is necessary to unambiguously justify screening. A prospective, randomized trial evaluating prostate cancer screening will soon be underway.",prostate cancer
"There is an abundance of evidence that the human microbiome plays an important and nuanced role in controlling human metabolism, immunity, and cancer. Herein we aim to review the most current research looking at prostate cancer and its link with the gut and genitourinary microbiome. There is now a host of evidence for a unique genitourinary (GU) microbiome. The prostate microbiota, to include viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic contributions, as assessed from formalin-fixed tissue is described nicely in the study by Banerjee et al. Further hierarchical analysis by this group found a unique microbiome signature for higher Gleason score cancers and validation PCR studies noted a marked number of viral genomic insertions into host DNA. Shretha et al. also recently established unique GU microbiomes in patients with prostate cancer or benign prostate pathology based on urine samples. The gut microbiome likely also has an indirect but significant role in prostate cancer development and treatment. Liss et al. and Golombos et al. found significant associations between specific gut microbiota and prostate cancer. Interestingly, the balance of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory bacterial lipopolysaccharides, production of bile salts, and metabolism of dietary fiber to short chain fatty acids all likely play important roles in creating systemic pro- or anti-carcinogenic states. In terms of prostate cancer treatment effects, Sfanos et al. noted a unique microbial signature in patients undergoing oral androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as compared with prostate cancer patients not on ADT. Patients undergoing ADT also had enrichment of bacterial metabolic pathways promoting androgen synthesis. Together, these studies have identified a unique GU microbiome and linked both the GU microbiome and unique gut microbial signatures with prostate cancer and prostate cancer treatments. Whether this information can be used in cancer prevention, treatment, or diagnosis are areas of ongoing and active research.",prostate cancer
Risk stratification in prostate cancer remains a significant clinical challenge.

"Background: Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy (STAMPEDE) trial showed the survival benefit for prostate radiotherapy in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients with a low metastatic burden. The result raises the next question whether additional radiotherapy to metastatic sites could improve the survival in those with a low metastatic burden. Methods: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of prostate-directed radiotherapy (PDRT) with or without metastasis-directed radiotherapy (MDRT) in newly diagnosed oligometastatic patients who underwent combination of high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, and androgen deprivation therapy. Forty patients with bone metastasis and node positive prostate cancer were retrospectively analyzed. Of these, 22 (55%), 3 (7%), and 15 (38%) patients had N1M0, M1a, and M1b, respectively. Eighteen patients (45%) received MDRT to all metastatic sites. All patients initially underwent ≧6 months of androgen deprivation therapy. Oligometastatic disease was defined as presence of five or fewer metastatic lesions. Median follow-up period was 62.5 months. Results: Of the 40 patients, the 5-year castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-free survival rate and cancer-specific survival was 64.4% and 87.9%, respectively. Pre- or post-treatment predictive value including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis ≥20 ng/mL, Gleason grade group 5, positive biopsy core rate ≥51%, PSA nadir level of ≥0.02 ng/mL after the radiotherapy, and no MDRT were significantly associated with progression to CRPC. Patients with MDRT had significantly higher probability of achieving a PSA level of <0.02 ng/mL than those without the therapy (88.8% vs 54.5%, P = 0.0354) and consequently had a better CRPC-free survival than those without the therapy (HR 0.319, 95%CI: 0.116-0.877). Comparing PDRT alone, PDRT with MDRT did not significantly increase the incidences of genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities. Conclusions: This single-institutional study revealed the feasibility of combining prostate brachytherapy and MDRT for newly diagnosed oligometastatic prostate cancer. This combined approach has potential to prolong CRPC-free survival.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: The objective of our study was to compare T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T2WI), combined T2-weighted and dynamic imaging (Dynamic), and combined T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the identification of the site of prostate cancer. Materials and methods: Before radical prostatectomy, 85 patients with prostate cancer underwent magnetic resonance imaging using a 1.5-T endorectal coil; we excluded 3 patients treated with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. The sites of prostate cancer in 82 patients were predicted by T2WI alone, T2WI + Dynamic, and T2WI + DWI, and the results were compared with the step-section analysis of radical prostatectomy specimens. The peripheral zone (PZ) and the transition zone (TZ) of the prostate were divided into left and right halves. Only tumors with a diameter of more than 5 mm were considered significant. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Az) for the prediction of the site of prostate cancer in the PZ of the prostate were as follows: 42%, 94%, 93%, and 0.76 for T2WI alone; 48%, 96%, 96%, and 0.78 for T2WI + Dynamic; and 50%, 96%, 96%, and 0.81 for T2WI + DWI. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and Az for the prediction of the site of prostate cancer in the TZ of the prostate were as follows: 31%, 92%, 76%, and 0.66 for T2WI alone; 46%, 82%, 67%, and 0.65 for T2WI + Dynamic; and 48%, 94%, 85%, and 0.71 for T2WI + DWI. Conclusion: The Az value for the prediction of prostate cancer in the PZ and those in the TZ of the prostate was the highest for the combined T2WI and DWI approach.",prostate cancer

"The incidence of prostate cancer, while still lower than in Western nations, is increasing rapidly in Asian countries due to a more westernized lifestyle. Prostate cancer mortality is declining in the USA, where most prostate cancers are diagnosed in the early stage. In contrast, the mortality rates of prostate cancer in Asian countries are expected to continue to increase, because the percentage of advanced-stage prostate cancers remains high. Therefore, early detection by prostate-specific antigen screening and a comprehensive strategy for cancer prevention are essential for Asian people. The exposure rate of prostate-specific antigen screening is very low in Asian countries. Increased prostate-specific antigen screening may reduce the mortality rate. The stances regarding population screening differ among countries. Urological associations should promote population screening. Reliable data from Asian countries are needed. The prostate cancer incidence is low in Asian countries, perhaps due to high soy consumption. Isoflavones may prevent prostate cancer in Asian countries, but that is not yet clear. A large, multinational study in Asia is needed to clarify whether or not isoflavone consumption shows efficacy in preventing prostate cancer. Clinical data suggest that hormonal therapy is more effective in Asians than in Westerners. Clinical guidelines should consider including hormonal therapy as one of the options for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. At the same time, effort should be made to decrease the adverse effects of each treatment. Collaborative studies on the treatment of prostate cancer should be carried out among Asian countries.",prostate cancer
"Substantial gaps exist in our ability to accurately predict prognosis, and these gaps limit our understanding of the complex mechanisms that contribute to the greatest cancer epidemic of our time, prostate cancer. This review addresses contemporary epidemiologic and biostatistical issues in prostate cancer. It covers the science of outcome prediction and biomarker evaluation, recognition of the need to combine biomarkers to improve the accuracy of our outcome estimates and an analysis of current outcome assessment methods, including the TNM staging system and multivariate regression models. The simplicity and intuitive ease of the current TNM staging system must be balanced against its serious limitations in predictive accuracy and its loss of clinical utility. Statistical regression methods are required as we move to the new era of personalized medicine. We must implement statistical approaches that integrate the new molecular biomarkers with existing prognostic biomarkers to accurately predict which patients require treatment and to determine the optimal therapy.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. Understanding the biologic underpinning of prostate cancer is necessary to best determine how biology is associated with the risk of disease progression and how this understanding might provide insight into the development of novel therapeutic approaches. The focus of this review is on the recently identified common ETS and non-ETS gene rearrangements in prostate cancer. Although multiple molecular alterations have been detected in prostate cancer, a basic understanding of gene fusion prostate cancer should help explain the clinical and biologic diversity, providing a rationale for a molecular subclassification of the disease.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer, like many diseases, is more common in older men. Although an estimated 1 in 7 men will be diagnosed with it, the majority of these men will not die from prostate cancer. The latent nature of this disease, the use of screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and the greater risk of dying from causes other than prostate cancer contribute to this disparity. As the US population continues to age, prostate cancer screening and disease management presents an increasingly important public health issue. We discuss the current PSA screening recommendations and practices in the USA and the benefits and harms of screening older populations.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a prevalent disease that affects the aging male population. Whilst there have been significant advances of our biological understanding of the disease, clinical translation of promising agents continues to lag behind. In part, this is due to a paucity of relevant experimental and pre-clinical models required to further develop effective prevention and therapeutic strategies. Genetically modified cell lines fail to entirely represent the genetic and molecular diversity of primary human specimens, particularly from localised disease. Furthermore, primary prostate cancer tissues are extremely difficult to grow in the laboratory and virtually all human models, whether they grow as xenografts in immune-deficient animals or as cell cultures, are genetically modified by the investigator or derived from patients with advanced metastatic disease. In this review, we discuss the latest advances and improvements to current methods of xenografting human primary prostate cancer, and their potential application to translational research.",prostate cancer
"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a glycoprotein produced exclusively by prostatic tissue. PSA's absolute tissue specificity makes it valuable as a forensic marker and, more important, as a tumor marker for prostatic cancer. Prostatic cancer is prevalent in the older male population and is a major cause of death in men. Previously, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) was used to help diagnose and monitor the efficacy of therapy for prostate cancer. PAP has now been displaced by PSA, which has greater clinical sensitivity even though it has less clinical specificity. PSA is useful for monitoring therapy, particularly surgical prostatectomy, because complete removal of the prostate gland should result in PSA being undetectable. Measurable PSA after radical prostatectomy indicates residual prostatic tissue or metastasis, and increasing PSA concentrations indicate recurrent disease. PSA is also useful for screening selected populations of patients with symptoms indicative of prostate cancer; its use for general screening is debatable because of its less-than-optimal specificity, the cost of unselected screening, and the lack of evidence that early detection of prostate cancer decreases morbidity and mortality. Distinguishing between patients with prostatic cancer and those with benign prostatic hypertrophy is particularly difficult because of the overlap in PSA values in the two groups. Determining the rate of change in PSA per year from serial measurements or calculating the ratio of PSA per volume of the prostate gland may allow these two groups to be more readily differentiated.",prostate cancer
"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA transcripts larger than 200 nucleotides that do not code for proteins the aberrant expression of which has been documented in various types of cancer, including prostate cancer. Lack of appropriate sensitive and specific biomarkers for prostate cancer has led to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, making lncRNAs promising novel biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets for the disease. The present review attempts to summarize the current knowledge of lncRNA expression patterns and mechanisms in prostate cancer, which contribute to carcinogenesis. In particular, we focused on lncRNAs regulated by androgen receptor and expressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The effect of 5α reductase inhibitors in prostate cancer has been extensively investigated. The studies determined that finasteride and also dutasteride reduced the risk of prostate cancer; however, particularly high-grade cancer was not reduced and may possibly even have been increased. This is appropriately reflected in the S3 guideline on prostate cancer. New data on early recognition show that after longer term observation prostate cancer-specific mortality can be more effectively reduced by screening than was initially shown by the original data from the ERSPC study. Active surveillance is becoming more important for the therapy of early prostate cancer. Other new publications have shown good results for patients who underwent surgery for high risk prostate cancer. For metastasized prostate cancer new immunotherapeutic, chemotherapeutic and hormonal options are now available or will soon be approved.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer continues to be the second leading cancer related death among men. In order to more fully develop effective prevention and intervention strategies for this prevalent disease, the underlying molecular mechanisms of initiation, progression and metastatic spread must be understood. To this end mouse models have an essential role in prostate cancer research in that they can closely mimic the pathological and biochemical features of the disease. In this review we discuss the history of autochthonous murine models of prostate cancer, the essentials of the idealized mouse model for prostate cancer and speculate on approaches towards this goal.",prostate cancer
"Local recurrent prostate cancer after radical treatment is found in the majority of men with a rising PSA. Salvage treatment procedures for recurrent disease, such as radiation therapy and ablative procedures, can provide long-term responses in well-selected cases. Prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows diagnosis and staging, and the value provides information on treatment selection, treatment planning and treatment guidance in local recurrent prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a major global health care challenge. Due to the recent relevant improvements in the diagnosis, imaging and treatment, management of these patients is becoming extremely complex. However, new multiple diagnostic procedures and treatment options, tailored on the single patient, require a multidisciplinary effort. Molecular imaging is gaining importance in the decision making process of prostate cancer patients, playing a key role in the majority of clinical setting, including staging, restaging during biochemical recurrence and castration-resistant stage. Moreover recent significant advances are changing the management of these patients impacting on the choice of therapeutic strategy. In particular, prostate-specific membrane antigen PET imaging is assuming the role of the gatekeeper addressing patients to the correct treatment option and also, in the advanced stages, selecting patients potentially suitable for targeted α- or β-therapy bridging to the fascinating concept of theranostic. Even if radioligand therapy found its first clinical application in 1946, in the last few years several α- or β-radionuclide prostate-specific membrane antigen-labeled for targeted therapy have been proposed where other treatment options do not show a significant impact on survival. The theranostic field is experiencing a rapid growth in prostate cancer giving to nuclear medicine a central role that has to be confirmed by further prospective studies.",prostate cancer
"Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is an imaging modality that combines anatomical MR imaging with one or more functional MRI sequences. It has become a versatile tool for detecting and characterising prostate cancer (PCa). The traditional role of mpMRI was confined to PCa staging, but due to the advanced imaging techniques, its role has expanded to various stages in clinical practises including tumour detection, disease monitor during active surveillance and sequential imaging for patient follow-up. Meanwhile, with the growing speed of data generation and the increasing volume of imaging data, it is highly demanded to apply computerised methods to process mpMRI data and extract useful information. Hence quantitative analysis for imaging data using radiomics has become an emerging paradigm. The application of radiomics approaches in prostate cancer has not only enabled automatic localisation of the disease but also provided a non-invasive solution to assess tumour biology (e.g. aggressiveness and the presence of hypoxia). This article reviews mpMRI and its expanding role in PCa detection, staging and patient management. Following that, an overview of prostate radiomics will be provided, with a special focus on its current applications as well as its future directions.",prostate cancer
"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly being recognized as a valuable tool for the assessment of prostate cancer. In recent years, MRI technology has matured, image acquisition and interpretation have improved, and a multitude of clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of MRI techniques for contributing to prostate cancer care.

"Purpose of review: Patients with clinically localized prostate cancer often undergo multiple therapies during their disease trajectory, either as planned combinations or as salvage for recurrence. Most studies of health-related quality of life in men with prostate cancer have focused on those receiving one modality or another. This review summarizes the little that is known about health-related quality of life after multiple therapies. Recent findings: Twelve articles are reviewed. One is more of historical interest at this time and sets the stage for the great prevalence of combination therapy with androgen ablation in men undergoing pelvic irradiation. Six deal with brachytherapy combined with external beam radiation therapy, androgen ablation, or both. Three address androgen ablation or radiation for biochemical recurrence. One presents outcomes following salvage radiation, and one summarizes results from patients undergoing salvage radiation or prostatectomy following primary treatment with the other. Summary: Combination therapy for early stage prostate cancer confers many additional decrements in health-related quality of life that must be considered when making treatment decisions, especially given the minimal differences in survival between various approaches.",prostate cancer
"Introduction: To evaluate the available evidence on the standard diagnosis and management of men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and providing the timely update on new pharmacological treatments. Evidence acquisition: A systematic literature search from from January 2000 until March 2017 was performed by combining the following MESH terms: castrate resistant prostate cancer, abiraterone, enzalutamide, 223radium, sipuleucel-T, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, resistance mechanisms, resistance to androgen deprivation, androgen receptor (AR) mutations, amplifications, splice variants, and AR alterations. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Evidence synthesis: In the few last years the introduction of new treatment modalities as abiraterone or enzalutamide have significantly change our prospective in mCRPC management increasing patients survival and quality of life. The standard imaging modalities to define the presence of regional or distant metastasis or the different resistant mechanisms to the available treatments are still an issue of debate, however several studies are ongoing to define the standard of care and to reduce treatments' resistance. Data from ongoing phase III trials are awaited to introduce in clinical new effective treatments that can be used in patients resistant to abiraterone/enzalutamide or more probably in a different phase of the disease. Conclusions: Castration resistant prostate cancer is now the key issue in prostate cancer management and research. Our challenge in the near future will be to identify the right treatment or better the right combination and sequencing of treatments that should be used in patients with mCRPC or even with advanced prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Background: At present, one in six men over age 50 carries the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but only one in 33 will die of the disease. In view of these facts, conservative strategies such as active surveillance (AS) are important in the management of prostate cancer. Methods: To obtain information on active surveillance, the Medline database was searched from January 2002 to April 2008 for the terms ""prostate cancer"" OR ""prostatic neoplasms,"" AND ""active surveillance"" OR ""expectant management"". In addition a manual search was performed in the reference lists of relevant publications on the treatment of prostate cancer and on active surveillance. Results: 88 relevant publications about active surveillance were found. The studies varied in methodological quality but consistently showed low rates of tumor progression and high rates of tumor-specific survival with active surveillance (99% to 100%). All 7 guidelines on the treatment of prostate cancer that have been published since 2006 list active surveillance in their recommendations as a therapeutic option for prostate cancer if there is a low risk of progression. In fact, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (U.K.) recommends the active surveillance exclusively as the treatment strategy for such cases. Conclusions: The guideline recommendations reflect a changed attitude toward the treatment of prostate cancer in the light of the early detection of these tumors and the data now available regarding active surveillance. A corresponding change in actual medical practice would be desirable. The treatment of prostate cancer should always be adapted to the individual needs of the patient, and risky treatments should only be used when absolutely necessary.",prostate cancer
"Accurate tumor detection and establishment of disease extent are important for optimal management of prostate cancer. Disease stage, beginning with identification of the index prostate lesion, followed by primary tumor, lymph node, and distant metastasis evaluation, provide crucial clinical information that not only have prognostic and predictive value, but guide patient management. A wide array of radiological imaging modalities including ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging have been used for the purpose of prostate cancer staging with variable diagnostic performance. Especially, the last years have seen remarkable technological advances in magnetic resonance imaging technology, enabling referring clinicians and radiologists to obtain even more valuable data regarding staging of prostate cancer. Marked improvements have been seen in detection of the index prostate lesion and evaluation of extraprostatic extension while further improvements are still needed in identifying metastatic lymph nodes. Novel approaches such as whole-body MRI are emerging for more accurate and reproducible assessment of bone metastasis. Post-treatment assessment of prostate cancer using radiological imaging is a topic with rapidly changing clinical context and special consideration is needed for the biochemical setting, that is, the relatively high serum prostate-specific antigen levels in studies assessing the value of radiological imaging for post-treatment assessment and emerging therapeutic approaches such as early salvage radiation therapy. The scope of this review is to provide the reader insight into the various ways radiology contribute to staging of prostate cancer in the context of both primary staging and post-treatment assessment. The strengths and limitations of each imaging modality are highlighted as well as topics that warrant future research.",prostate cancer
"Genes involved in cancer generation are usually tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Progressive genetic alterations in these genes are involved in the mechanisms of tumorigenesis. In prostate cancer, additionally several chromosomal loci that should harbor mutated genes have been proposed. Some genes have been found altered in prostate cancer, such as PTEN, TP53, AR, RNASEL (HPC1), ELAC2 (HPC2), CDKN2A and MSR1 and those can be natural targets for new strategies of treatment. Besides, gene therapy has been suggested to be suitable for prostate cancer treatment. This approach includes ex vivo corrective therapy, suicide, and antisense therapy.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in the developed world. There is an inherited component to this disease as shown in familial and twin studies. However, the discovery of these variants has been difficult. The emergence of genome-wide association studies has led to the identification of over 46 susceptibility loci. Their clinical utility to predict risk, response to treatment, or treatment toxicity, remains undefined. Large consortia are needed to achieve adequate statistical power to answer these genetic-clinical and genetic-epidemiological questions. International collaborations are currently underway to link genetic with clinical/epidemiological data to develop risk prediction models, which could direct screening and treatment programs.",prostate cancer
"There is no standard treatment for locally advanced prostate cancer. Even the definition is still unclear. Locally advanced disease may refer to over-staged well-curable tumors as well as to advanced and probably incurable cancers. Similar uncertainties are present regarding the definition of 'old' in this context. Conservatively treated locally advanced prostate cancer is associated with poor survival outcome. With the increasing life expectancy, in the absence of curative treatment, even patients in their ninth decade of life may later suffer from symptoms of aggressive prostate cancer and are at a high risk of death from prostate cancer that might be prevented at least in part by early intervention. On the other hand, functional results after prostate cancer treatment are worse in elderly patients. In this article we discuss aspects of the management of locally advanced prostate cancer in the elderly with special focus on the recommendation of current clinical guidelines.",prostate cancer

"Objectives: To assess the ability of preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score and stage to predict prostate cancer outcomes beyond biochemical recurrence, specifically castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastases and prostate cancer-specific mortality in radical prostatectomy patients. Methods: We carried out a retrospective study of 2735 men in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database treated by radical prostatectomy from 1988 to 2011 with data available on pathological stage, grade and preoperative prostate-specific antigen. We used Cox hazards analyses to examine the predictive accuracy (c-index) of the preoperative prostate-specific antigen (log-transformed), path Gleason score (≤ 7, 3 + 4, 4 + 3 and 8-10) and path stage grouping (pT2 negative margins; pT2 positive margins; pT3a negative margins; pT3a positive margins; pT3b; vs positive nodes) to predict biochemical recurrence, castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastases and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Results: Median follow up was 8.7 years, during which, 937 (34%) had biochemical recurrence, 108 (4%) castration-resistant prostate cancer, 127 (5%) metastases and 68 (2%) prostate cancer-specific mortality. For the outcomes of biochemical recurrence, castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastases and prostate cancer-specific mortality, the c-indices were, respectively: prostate-specific antigen 0.65, 0.66, 0.64 and 0.69; Gleason score 0.66, 0.83, 0.76 and 0.85; and pathological stage group 0.69, 0.76, 0.72 and 0.80. Conclusions: Gleason score can predict with very high accuracy prostate cancer-specific mortality in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Thus, Gleason score should be given more weight in nomograms to predict prostate cancer-specific mortality. Furthermore, men with a high Gleason score should be given special consideration for adjuvant treatment or referral to clinical trials because of a higher risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer remains the most common malignancy diagnosed in men andis the third leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States and Europe.On this basis, it is anticipated by many that the rates of prostate cancer mortality may rise in the years to come. As a result, a number of new challenges have emerged in prostate cancer, forcing urologists to consider new paradigms in the disease management: both to improve methods of detection and to be more effective in managing the likely increasing numbers of men with advanced disease.",prostate cancer
"Data on the incidence and mortality from prostate cancer are available in this country and others, but there are few sources of information relating to widely prevalent clinical practices. The long- and short-term prostate cancer surveys conducted by the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons offer a system of assessing patterns of cancer patient care in a large number of hospitals in the United States. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) System indicate that at every age blacks experience greater rates of incidence and mortality than whites. Comparisons of modes of diagnosis reported for black and white patients for 1974 and 1979 from the American College of Surgeons surveys show little difference between these groups, indicating that the excess in incidence among blacks is not attributable to differential patterns of diagnosis. The survey results also indicate that white patients appear to have a slight survival advantage in stages B, C, and D. The lower survival appears to be the product of relatively advanced stage of the disease rather than the result of biologically more malignant nature of prostate cancer in the blacks.",prostate cancer
"We hypothesized that prostate cancer screening and availability of urologists among states may be associated with reduced prostate cancer mortality in the United States. To test this hypothesis, state-specific prostate cancer mortality rates for white males were compared to urologist population densities and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening rates on a state-by-state basis. The urologist population density was calculated by dividing the number of urologists per state by the population. We found that prostate cancer mortality rates correlated inversely with urologist population densities (P<0.01) and PSA screening (P<0.01) suggesting that screening and treatment reduce prostate cancer mortality.",prostate cancer
"Several other newer therapeutic modalities are being investigated to determine their potential role in the treatment of prostate cancer. Cryotherapy, microwave hyperthermia, laser therapy, and high-intensity focused ultrasound have all been introduced in recent years.

Insufficient follow-up data are available to allow strong recommendations regarding these treatments.",prostate cancer
"Antiandrogen therapy is an important modality in the treatment of prostate cancer. Recent research into the role of angiogenesis in tumour growth and metastasis has uncovered links between antiandrogen therapy, radiation therapy and angiogenesis, which have exciting implications for the treatment of prostate cancer.

This article assesses the antiangiogenic effects of hormonal therapy and assesses the role that angiogenesis may play in the observed cooperation between hormonal and radiation therapies for prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"In the nineteenth century the main goal of medicine was predictive: diagnose the disease and achieve a satisfying prognosis of the patient's chances. Today the effort has shifted to cure the disease. Since the twentieth century, the word prognosis has also been used in nonmedical contexts, for example in corporate finance or elections. The most accurate form of prognosis is achieved statistically. Based on different prognostic factors it should be possible to tell patients how they are expected to do after prostate cancer has been diagnosed and how different treatments may change this outcome. A prognosis is a prediction. The word prognosis comes from the Greek word (see text) and means foreknowing. In the nineteenth century this was the main goal of medicine: diagnose the disease and achieve a satisfying prognosis of the patient's chances. Today the effort has shifted towards seeking a cure. Prognostic factors in (prostate) cancer are defined as ""variables that can account for some of the heterogeneity associated with the expected course and outcome of a disease"". Bailey defined prognosis as ""a reasoned forecast concerning the course, pattern, progression, duration, and end of the disease. Prognostic factors are not only essential to understand the natural history and the course of the disease, but also to predict possible different outcomes of different treatments or perhaps no treatment at all. This is extremely important in a disease like prostate cancer where there is clear evidence that a substantial number of cases discovered by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing are unlikely ever to become clinically significant, not to mention mortal. Furthermore, prognostic factors are of paramount importance for correct interpretation of clinical trials and for the construction of future trials. Finally, according to WHO national screening committee criteria for implementing a national screening programme, widely accepted prognostic factors must be defined before assessing screening.",prostate cancer
"The concentration of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in serum was measured in 20 brothers or sons in 10 families in which the father and son or brothers had prostate cancer using the E test TOSOH IIPA. The patients were between 32 and 70 years old with a mean age of 48.2 years. The PSA value was between 0.4 and 19.5 ng/ml with a mean value of 3.4 ng/ml. Five patients (25%) had PSA values exceeding the cut-off value of 4.0 ng/ml. After obtaining their consent, systematic prostate needle biopsy by transrectal ultrasonography was performed on 3 patients (15%). Prostate cancer was detected in all of them. Among them 2 patients were brothers, and since the other two brothers already had prostate cancer, all four brothers were confirmed to have prostate cancer. This is the first report of a familial prostate cancer in four brothers in Japan. In the western countries where the incidence of prostate cancer is higher than that in Japan, studies have been performed on the risk factors. Family history is one of the most important risk factors. In Japan, the incidence of prostate cancer is increasing rapidly. Moreover, patients with a prostate cancer family history are expected to increase. In such cases, prostate cancer screening should be performed aggressively from a young age.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men, in general. Most patients diagnosed with prostate cancer have localized disease confined to the prostate. A small percentage of patients with aggressive tumors will progress to develop local, extracapsular tumor extension and distant metastases. The aim of prostate cancer management is to identify and treat those patients with aggressive disease before they develop locally advanced or metastatic disease, and to avoid overtreating indolent tumors, which are unlikely to be life threatening. Imaging has been shown to be valuable in local staging of prostate cancer and as an aid to the management of clinically significant disease. In this article, we discuss the different established imaging modalities and emerging techniques for prostate cancer imaging in patients with clinically localized disease who may be suitable for radical treatment.",prostate cancer
"The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an NPO organization comprised of university hospitals and cancer centers in the US.

Background factors of prostate cancer patients, such as the prevalence, age at the diagnosis and mortality are markedly different between Western countries and Asia. Thus, various factors should be taken into consideration at the treatment choice for individual patients. Experts from Asian countries were published as the Asia Consensus Statement. In this review, we explain important points of the Asia Consensus Statement such as differences in the epidemiological backgrounds of patients, differences in treatment options and differences in medical insurance systems.",prostate cancer
"The definition of clinically significant prostate cancer is a dynamic process that was initiated many decades ago, when there was already evidence that a great proportion of patients with prostate cancer diagnosed at autopsy never had any clinical symptoms. Autopsy studies led to examinations of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens and the establishment of the definition of significant cancer at RP: tumour volume of 0.5 cm3 , Gleason grade 6 [Grade Group (GrG) 1], and organ-confined disease. RP studies were then used to develop prediction models for significant cancer by the use of needle biopsies. The first such model was used to delineate the first active surveillance (AS) criteria, known as the 'Epstein' criteria, in which patients with a cancer Gleason score of 3 + 3 = 6 (GrG1) involving fewer than two cores, and <50% of any given core, and a prostate-specific antigen density of <0.15 ng/ml per cm3 had a minimal risk of significant cancer at RP. These were adopted as components of the 'very-low-risk category' of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, in which AS is supported as a management option. With the increase in the popularity of AS, much research has been carried out to better define significant/insignificant cancer, in order to be able to safely offer AS to a larger proportion of patients without the risk of undertreatment. Research has focused on allowing higher volume tumours, focal extraprostatic extension, and a limited amount of Gleason pattern 4, and the significance of different morphological patterns of Gleason 4. Other areas of research that will probably impact on the field but that are not covered in this review include the molecular classification of tumours and imaging techniques.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is now the second most common cause of male cancer-related deaths in the USA. This article reviews the factors that account for the recent rapid increase in incidence.

"Objectives: To determine whether the expression level of clusterin in prostate cancer could be used as a prognostic predictor in patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy (RP). Methods: This study included 172 consecutive patients undergoing RP for clinically organ-confined prostate cancer without neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. Immunohistochemical staining was performed in RP specimens obtained from these patients to evaluate the expression level of clusterin protein. The cell proliferative activities and apoptotic features in these specimens were investigated using Ki-67 immunostaining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay, respectively. Results: Varying levels of clusterin expression were noted in 169 of 172 prostate cancer specimens; 32 of the 172 normal prostatic tissue specimens did not exhibit any clusterin staining. Clusterin expression in prostate cancer tissue was significantly related to the Gleason score, but not to the other parameters, including age, serum prostate-specific antigen level, pathologic stage, perineural invasion, tumor volume, and lymph node metastasis. In addition, cell proliferative activity in the prostate cancer specimens was significantly associated with clusterin expression; however, no correlation was found between the apoptotic index and clusterin expression. In this series, 34 (19.8%) of 172 patients developed biochemical recurrence. No significant difference was found in biochemical/recurrence-free survival between patients with strong clusterin expression and those with weak expression. Conclusions: Despite its detection in most prostate cancer tissue, clusterin expression failed to show a significant association with prognosis in patients undergoing RP without neoadjuvant hormonal therapy. This suggests a limited role for clusterin in the progression of clinically organ-confined prostate cancer in the absence of proapoptotic stimuli.",prostate cancer
"Radical prostatectomy may lead to cure as long as the cancer is confined to the prostate and all malignant cells are removed. However, clinical staging is inaccurate and a significant proportion of cT1-T2 patients have positive margins which increases the likelihood of disease progression within 5 years of surgery. Neoadjuvant hormone therapy is one option being used to increase the likelihood of prostate cancer cure after radical prostatectomy. Randomized clinical trials using neoadjuvant hormone therapy and radical prostatectomy have been conducted mainly in patients with cT1 and cT2 prostate cancer. A decrease in the number of positive surgical margins was found in cT1 and cT2 prostate cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant hormone therapy, with a further decrease in those receiving treatment over longer periods. In cT3 prostate cancer patients equivocal results have been obtained and further research is needed. None of the studies reported so far were able to define the impact of neoadjuvant treatment on the surgical management of locally advanced prostate cancer. Additional studies are required to determine the optimal type and duration of hormone treatment. Furthermore, long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate whether neoadjuvant therapy will improve overall survival. In the meantime, patients must be informed of the advantages and disadvantages of treatment to allow them to make informed treatment decisions.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is currently the most common malignancy among men in Sweden, and an estimated 5-10 per cent of cases are hereditary. Several epidemiological studies have shown men whose close relatives are affected to be at 2-4-fold increased risk of developing prostate cancer. In a recent genetic linkage study of 91 Swedish and North American families with hereditary prostate cancer, the first susceptibility locus, HPC 1 (hereditary prostate cancer 1), was localised at positions 1q24-25 on the long arm of chromosome 1. In Sweden, we recommend men with a strong family history of prostate cancer to undergo annual prostate-specific antigen testing and digital rectal examination from the age of 50.",prostate cancer
"The morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer have been increasing recently, and the comprehensive treatment for prostate cancer is unable to achieve satisfactory outcomes. Quercetin is a natural flavonoid compound that has attracted increased interest and attention due to its anticancer activity. In vitro and in vivo studies have verified that quercetin effectively inhibits prostate cancer via various mechanisms. Clinical trails concerning the pharmacokinetics and application of quercetin in humans have also obtained promising results. Meanwhile, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated a negative association between quercetin intake and prostate cancer incidence and have suggested a chemopreventive effect of quercetin on prostate cancer that has been exhibited in animal experiments. The main issue concerning quercetin utilization is its low bioavailability. Therefore, solutions to the issues concerning its use such as alteration of the molecular structure and combination therapy are in the exploratory stage. In the present review, the most important aspects of chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive effects, mechanisms and clinical application potential of quercetin in prostate cancer are summarized.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among males. Although use of the micro-nutrient selenium in prostate cancer clinical trials is limited, the outcomes indicate that selenium is a promising treatment. Furthermore, selenium inhibits prostate cancer through multiple mechanisms, and it is beneficial in controlling the development of this disease. This review highlights the latest epidemiological and biomolecular research on selenium in prostate cancer, as well as its prospects for future clinical use.",prostate cancer
"Approximately 15-30% of men with localized prostate cancer will experience biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy. Postoperative radiation therapy is used in men with adverse pathological features to reduce the risk of BCR or with curative intent in men with known BCR. In this study, we review the evidence for the adjuvant and salvage radiation therapy after radical prostatectomy. Areas covered: A literature review of the Medline and Embase databases was performed. The search strategy included the following terms: prostate cancer, adjuvant radiotherapy, salvage radiotherapy, radical prostatectomy, biochemical recurrence, and prostate cancer recurrence. Prospective randomized trials for the adjuvant radiotherapy and observational studies supporting salvage radiotherapy were included for discussion. Expert commentary: As postoperative radiotherapy is associated with non-trivial risks of acute and long-term toxicity and given the absence of compelling data supporting adjuvant over early salvage radiotherapy, the authors advocate, with rare exceptions, close observation and timely (early) salvage radiotherapy for patients with BCR and long life expectancy. Adjuvant radiotherapy may be considered in patients at high-risk for recurrence. Observation is appropriate in patients with limited life expectancy and/or absence of adverse features.",prostate cancer
"In the United States, more than 90 percent of prostate cancers are detected by serum prostate-specific antigen testing. Most patients are found to have localized prostate cancer, and most of these patients undergo surgery or radiotherapy. However, many patients have low-risk cancer and can follow an active surveillance protocol instead of undergoing invasive treatments. Active surveillance is a new concept in which low-risk patients are closely followed and proceed to intervention only if their cancer progresses. Clinical guidelines can help in selecting between treatment or active surveillance based on the cancer's stage and grade, the patient's prostate-specific antigen level, and the comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy. Radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy is recommended for higher-risk patients. These treatments are almost equivalent in effectiveness, but have different adverse effect profiles. Brachytherapy is an option for low- and moderate-risk patients. Evidence is insufficient to determine whether laparoscopic or robotic surgery or cryotherapy is superior to open radical prostatectomy.",prostate cancer
"With an incidence of approximately 60,000 per year prostate cancer is the most common malignant neoplasm in men with a relatively low mortality rate and a high mean age of primary diagnosis of about 70 years. The disease remains usually clinically occult over a long period of time and generally manifests primarily in a locally advanced or metastasized stage. Due to screening using the PSA level (prostate specific antigen) in blood serum, diagnosis and therapy nowadays are oftentimes possible at an early stage. The prostate carcinoma is classified using risk groups based on the level of PSA, the local tumor spread and the histological degree of differentiation (Gleason score). If no metastases are detected during staging a local curative therapy is indicated, provided that the patient is eligible for this due to age, comorbidity and life expectancy. Depending on the risk group of the patient, radical prostatectomy, percutaneous radiotherapy, brachytherapy or active surveillance are available as curative therapy concepts. Focal therapies such as HIFU, electrovaporization or cryotherapy are currently considered to be experimental. If metastases are already present at primary diagnosis, palliative, systemic therapy can be performed with an androgen deprivation therapy and chemotherapy. At an advanced and hormone refractory stage, treatment with an osteotropic radiotracer or palliative radiotherapy can reduce bone metastases and alleviate respective symptoms.",prostate cancer
"A 79 year-old-man visited our hospital with right back pain. Computed tomography suggested external iliac and para-aortic lymphadenopathy. Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) increased to 335 ng/ml and prostate cancer was highly suspected. We performed transperineal prostate biopsies two times, but could not detect prostate carcinoma cells. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated no suspicious malignant lesions in the prostate. Laparoscopic biopsy of the right obturator lymph nodes was performed and histological examination, including immunohistochemical staining with PSA, confirmed lymphnode metastasis from prostate cancer. After endocrine therapy was started, serum PSA levels declined and lymph nodes shrunk. In cases of negative prostate biopsies despite high serum PSA levels, aggressive indication for biopsy of metastatic lesion and histological inspection is highly recommended.",prostate cancer
"We describe a 75-year-old man with undifferentiated prostate cancer that was treated with radiation therapy. He presented at a nearby general hospital with dysuria and pain upon micturition. He was diagnosed with undifferentiated prostate cancer by a needle biopsy and referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. Enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance images showed prostate cancer and right obturator lymph node metastasis measuring 2.5 cm. Cystoscopy and colonoscopy revealed direct invasion of the urinary bladder and rectum. We constructed a vesical fistula and an artificial anus, and then treated the primary tumor and lymph node metastasis with radiation. Undifferentiated prostate cancer is extremely rare and to our knowledge only a few cases have been reported. We suggest that radiation might be effective for treating undifferentiated prostate cancer with or without local invasion and/or metastasis along with total body control.",prostate cancer
"To date, there are no studies conclusively documenting that one treatment for localized prostate cancer is superior to another in terms of overall survival. Therefore, patients must consider other outcomes when choosing primary therapy for localized disease. One of the most important factors patients consider when choosing their treatment is the effect of therapy on their quality of life (QOL). Over the past decade, there have been an increasing number of studies assessing health related QOL (HRQOL) outcomes in localized prostate cancer. The goal of this article is to review our current understanding of HRQOL in this disease. We will begin by examining the established HRQOL instruments for use in localized prostate cancer. We will then discuss the effect of various treatments on QOL and review the literature comparing HRQOL outcomes between therapies.",prostate cancer
"Wnt5a, a member of non-canonical wingless-related MMTV integration site family is a secreted glycoprotein that plays important roles in development and disease. Recent studies have shown that Wnt5a protein levels are up-regulated in prostate cancer, but contrasting reports exist on the role of Wnt5a to predict outcome after radical prostatectomy in patients with localized prostate cancer. Our group has recently shown that preserved high protein expression of Wnt5a in prostate cancer is associated with longer relapse-free time after radical prostatectomy. The present tissue microarray study emphasizes the role of Wnt5a protein expression in a different, well-defined, and independent cohort consisting of 312 prostate cancer patients. Kaplan-Meier curves plotted between Wnt5a expression and time to biochemical recurrence revealed that in low-grade prostate cancer, patients with preserved high-Wnt5a protein levels in their tumor cells have a lower risk of recurrence after radical prostatectomy compared to patients with low-Wnt5a protein expression. When Wnt5a protein expression was added to a Cox regression multivariate analysis, both Wnt5a protein expression and surgical margin status independently predict biochemical free survival. Herein we confirm Wnt5a positivity as a prognostic factor and show that preserved overexpression of Wnt5a protein is associated with increased time to biochemical recurrence in localized low-grade prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy. Our results emphasize that Wnt5a can be used as a predictive biomarker, and favoring the view of Wnt5a as a future therapeutic target in prostate cancer patients with tumor cells displaying low expression of Wnt5a.",prostate cancer
"The increasing potency of therapies that target the androgen receptor (AR) signalling axis has correlated with a rise in the proportion of patients with prostate cancer harbouring an adaptive phenotype, termed treatment-induced lineage crisis. This phenotype is characterized by features that include soft-tissue metastasis and/or resistance to standard anticancer therapies. Potent anticancer treatments might force cancer cells to evolve and develop alternative cell lineages that are resistant to primary therapies, a mechanism similar to the generation of multidrug- resistant microorganisms after continued antibiotic use. Herein, we assess the hypothesis that treatment-adapted phenotypes harbour reduced AR expression and/or activity, and acquire compensatory strategies for cell survival. We highlight the striking similarities between castration-resistant prostate cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, another poorly differentiated endocrine malignancy. Alternative treatment paradigms are needed to avoid therapy-induced resistance. Herein, we present a new clinical trial strategy designed to evaluate the potential of rapid drug cycling as an approach to delay the onset of resistance and treatment-induced lineage crisis in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Part 1 of a two-part discussion of Prostate Cancer from an underwriting perspective, covers the epidemiology and screening for prostate cancer. Included is a ""Primer on Screening Tests"" that discusses problems with digital rectal exam (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) as screening tests. Approaches to enhancing the use of PSA for screening including age and race specific ranging, PSA density, PSA velocity, free PSA, and complexed PSA are discussed. Arguments for and against the use of PSA for prostate cancer are presented. The widespread use of PSA testing in the insurance setting is contrasted with cautious statements concerning general use of PSA in the clinical preventive care setting. In a future issue, Part 2 will cover staging and follow-up of treated prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"As the leading culprit in cancer incidence for American men, prostate cancer continues to pose significant diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tribulations for clinicians. The vast spectrum of disease behavior warrants better molecular classification to facilitate the development of more robust biomarkers that can identify the more aggressive and clinically significant tumor subtypes that require treatment. The untranslated portion of the human transcriptome, namely noncoding RNAs (ncRNA), is emerging as a key player in cancer initiation and progression and boasts many attractive features for both biomarker and therapeutic research. Genetic linkage studies show that many ncRNAs are located in cancer-associated genomic regions that are frequently deleted or amplified in prostate cancer, whereas aberrant ncRNA expression patterns have well-established links with prostate tumor cell proliferation and survival. The dysregulation of pathways controlled by ncRNAs results in a cascade of multicellular events leading to carcinogenesis and tumor progression. The characterization of RNA species, their functions, and their clinical applicability is a major area of biologic and clinical importance. This review summarizes the growing body of evidence, supporting a pivotal role for ncRNAs in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. We highlight the most promising ncRNA biomarkers for detection and risk stratification and present the state-of-play for RNA-based personalized medicine in treating the ""untreatable"" prostate tumors.",prostate cancer
"This study was conducted to identify the factors perceived by African-American men as influencing their behavior relative to prostate cancer screening. A total of 49 African-American men, age 40 and above, participated in 10 focus group discussions in Florida. Data collection was between October 12, 2001 and March 9, 2002 in Tallahassee, Tampa, and Miami. Data analysis was conducted using a comprehensive ethnographical analysis, including the use of an ethnographical retrieval program, Nonnumerical Unstructured Data Indexing Searching and Theorizing (QSR NUD*IST 4.0) software. Factors identified as influencing prostate cancer screening participation by African-American men were impediments to prostate cancer screening; positive outcome beliefs associated with prostate cancer screening; social influence; negative outcome beliefs associated with prostate cancer screening; resources or opportunities that facilitate prostate cancer screening; prostate cancer knowledge; perceived susceptibility to prostate cancer; perceived threat of prostate cancer; perceived severity of prostate cancer; positive health activities; illness experience; and prostate cancer screening intervention message concept, message source, and message channel. The results of this study may offer an excellent guide to designing effective, culturally sensitive, and relevant interventions, which would increase African-American men's participation in prostate cancer screening.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: A recent update of the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study-4 concluded that men older than 65 years treated with radical prostatectomy had no survival advantage compared to men treated with watchful waiting. We examined the proportion and outcomes of men 65 years old or older with low risk disease who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution. Materials and methods: Our institutional radical prostatectomy database with more than 19,000 patients was queried for men 65 years old or older with low risk prostate cancer. Pathological and survival outcomes were assessed. Subanalysis was done on men 70 years old or older to determine whether outcomes among older men differed by age. Results: A total of 1,560 men (8.1%) 65 years old or older with low risk prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy between 1983 and 2010. After radical prostatectomy 38.3% of the men had evidence of more aggressive cancer, including Gleason score 7 or greater, or extraprostatic extension. After radical prostatectomy actuarial 5, 10 and 15-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was 93.2%, 89.2% and 82.2%, prostate cancer specific survival was 99.7%, 98.4% and 97.2%, and overall survival was 96.1%, 83.5% and 60.2%, respectively. Conclusions: Fewer than 10% of men treated with radical prostatectomy at our institution were 65 years old or older with low risk prostate cancer. Despite a high prevalence of aggressive disease discovered at surgery these men experienced excellent long-term survival. Treatment recommendations in older men with low risk prostate cancer should be made after careful consideration of life expectancy based on comorbidities and potential adverse outcomes of treatment.",prostate cancer
"Objective: To analyze the impact of 2 systematic transition zone (TZ) biopsies in addition to systematic sextant biopsies in an effort to establish the importance of cancer detected in the transition zone. Methods: Between November 1995 and October 1996, TRUS-guided systematic sextant peripheral zone (PZ) and two additional TZ biopsies were performed on 189 consecutive men. Radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) was performed to 13 patients with organ-confined prostate cancer. The biopsy results of the 52 patients with cancer and the pathological specimens of the patients who underwent surgery were compared. Results: Of the 189 patients, 52 (27.5%) had prostate cancer of whom 20 (38.5%) both in the PZ and TZ, 31 (59.6%) only in the PZ, and 1 (1.9%) in the TZ only. Of the 96 patients with high serum PSA levels despite normal DRE, 14 had prostate cancer. TZ cancer only rate was 7.1% (1 in 14 patients) in this group. RRP was performed to 8 patients who had cancer only in the PZ and 5 patients in both TZ and PZ. The pathological stages of the postoperative specimens and extracapsular extension rates of those with cancer in the PZ and TZ were significantly higher (p = 0.029 and p = 0.008, respectively). Conclusions: Routine TZ biopsy does not substantially increase the prostate cancer detection rate, however it can be useful in selected patient groups. If further studies reveal the relationship of cancer in the transition zone, higher capsular extension rate (pT3 cancer) and higher pathological stage after radical surgery, then TZ biopsies may yield additional information that might influence the therapeutic approach.",prostate cancer
"Recent decades have seen dramatic changes in the management of prostate cancer based on novel research findings. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has been introduced, and then recently modified to include new strategies and biomarkers. Management of advanced disease has been transformed by the rapid introduction of new agents. We have moved from a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach in prostate cancer management to multidisciplinary strategies tailored to the individual patient and his specific cancer. This editorial marks the launch of the article collection Spotlight on prostate cancer (http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcmed/series/SPR), and here, guest editors Sigrid Carlsson and Andrew Vickers give an overview of the past, present, and future of prostate cancer research and management.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is biologically and clinically a heterogeneous disease and its imaging evaluation will need to be tailored to the specific phases of the disease in a patient-specific, risk-adapted manner. We first present a brief overview of the natural history of prostate cancer before discussing the role of various imaging tools, including opportunities and challenges, for different clinical phases of this common disease in men. We then review the preclinical and clinical evidence on the potential and emerging role of positron emission tomography with various radiotracers in the imaging evaluation of men with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"One in six males will develop prostate cancer during their lifetime. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American males, behind only lung cancer. Unfortunately, even though this disease is so common, clinical screening methods such as prostate-specific antigen test and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy lack sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing prostate cancer. In recent years, multiparametric prostate MRI has emerged as a very important tool in the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma with a high accuracy. However, diagnostic difficulty is often encountered even with an experienced abdominal radiologist. That is mainly because many normal and abnormal entities can mimic prostate carcinoma at multiparametric MRI. Therefore, the purpose of this pictorial review is to discuss the usefulness of multiparametric prostate MRI in the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma, emphasizing the key MRI features that help to make a distinction of prostate carcinoma from its mimics.",prostate cancer
"Surveillance with deferred treatment in patients with clinically prostate-confined prostate cancer is a controversial subject. The policy of prostate cancer screening for increasingly low PSA levels and the use of more extensive biopsy protocols result in the detection of a large number of small tumours, probably early in their subclinical course. Conversely, some patients who receive initial active treatment are understaged by the pretreatment assessment and develop treatment-related adverse effects without any oncological benefit. The main published series concerning surveillance were analysed with particular emphasis on those with the longest observation periods. Data concerning specific survival and progression-free survival are discussed, together with the results obtained in terms of the quality of life of patients submitted to surveillance. Analysis of these data show a potential benefit of surveillance in elderly patients (over the age of 70 years) with small, low-grade prostatic tumours.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer represents a third of all newly diagnosed cancers in men in the USA with an estimated incidence of 192,280 cases and 27,360 deaths in 2009. It continues to be a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality, and there is an urgent need for new treatments. Historically, systemic therapy options were limited after progression on docetaxel-based chemotherapy. This article reviews current data on the novel therapeutics demonstrating activity in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and their future role in the treatment of this disease with a poor prognosis.",prostate cancer
"Previous reports have claimed that transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) preceding definitive radiation therapy for patients with Stage C prostate cancer promotes the risk of distant metastasis and increases the mortality rate. A total of 490 patients with pathologic Stage C adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated by radical prostatectomy were studied. Median time to follow-up was 4.6 years. Comparison was made between patients who had TURP within the six months preceding prostatectomy (n = 54) and those who had needle biopsy (n = 437) prior to operation. No significant differences were noted in local recurrence of disease, systemic progression of disease, disease-free interval, and overall and cause-specific survival, even after adjustment for clinical (adjuvant treatment) and pathologic prognostic variables. Our data suggest that for patients with pathologic Stage C prostate cancer treated by radical surgery, preoperative TURP is not associated with unfavorable outcome.",prostate cancer
"Once prostate cancer becomes castration resistant, cancer cells may rapidly gain the ability to invade and to metastasize to lymph nodes and distant organs. The progression through hormone-dependent to hormone-independent/castration-resistant and metastatic PCa is poorly understood. In this review paper, we provide an overview on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the process of tumor cell invasion and metastasis in prostate cancer. We specifically present the most recent findings on the role of multiple cellular signaling pathways including androgen receptor (AR), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), Akt, transforming growth factor b (TGFb interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the development of hormone-independent/castration-resistant prostate cancer. In addition, we also discuss the recent findings on signatures of gene expression during prostate cancer progression. Our overviews on the novel findings will help to gain better understanding of the complexity of molecular mechanisms that may play an essential role in the development of castration-resistant and metastatic prostate cancer. It will also shed light on the identification of specific targets and the design of effective therapeutic drug candidates.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: Despite the well documented stage migration in prostate cancer, a substantial number of men still present to urologists with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Recent findings: The beneficial role of prostatectomy has been affirmed in several studies examining its therapeutic impact in locally advanced, nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Adjuvant therapy with radiation or hormones appears to increase prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival. Whether prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival is an appropriate surrogate for overall survival remains unverified. The timing and duration of hormonal therapy continues to be debated. Hormone therapy administered 'too late' in the course of metastatic disease portends a shortened survival but possible side effects of androgen ablation must be considered. Several docetaxel-based combination chemotherapies for hormone refractory prostate cancer are being studied, but their efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting thus far has been limited. Progress in the palliation of bony metastases has resulted in a decrease in symptoms and skeletal events. Summary: This review identifies seminal data that focus on controversial therapeutic dilemmas in prostate cancer. The literature of the last few years universally emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary collaboration in prostate cancer. It is only with this type of cooperation that essential research will continue and succeed.",prostate cancer
"The genomic landscape of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) differs from that of the primary tumor and is dynamic during tumor progression. The real-time and repeated characterization of this process via conventional solid tumor biopsies is challenging. Alternatively, circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) containing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be obtained from patient plasma using minimally disruptive blood draws and is amenable to sequential analysis. ctDNA has high overlap with the genomic sequences of biopsies from metastases and has the advantage of being representative of multiple metastases. The availability of techniques with high sensitivity and specificity, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and digital PCR, has greatly contributed to the development of the cfDNA field and enabled the detection of genomic alterations at low ctDNA fractions. In mCRPC, a number of clinically relevant genomic alterations have been tracked in ctDNA, including androgen receptor (AR) aberrations, which have been shown to be associated with an adverse outcome to novel antiandrogen therapies, and alterations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes, which have been associated with a response to PARP inhibitors. Several clinical applications have been proposed for cfDNA analysis, including its use as a prognostic tool, as a predictive biomarker, to monitor tumor response and to identify novel mechanisms of resistance. To date, the cfDNA analysis has provided interesting results, but there is an urgent need for these findings to be confirmed in prospective clinical trials.",prostate cancer
"Gleason's score (GS) has been reported to be the most valuable prognostic factor in cases of prostate cancer. GS is solely dependent on the histological architecture of the prostate cancer, but, it seems doubtful that histological patterns are sufficient for evaluating the degree of malignancy of prostate cancer. We previously reported that the estimation of volume-weighted mean nuclear volume (MNV) might be a more useful prognosticator for prostate cancer than subjective histological grading. However, the previous study was conducted on patients treated in a single hospital, and the number of subjects was too small to draw a definitive conclusion. In this study, we analyzed a larger number of subjects at another institution using a blinded study design. A retrospective prognostic study of 195 patients with prostate cancer diagnosed between January 1966 and December 1988 at Kyoto University Hospital, and treated by conservative therapy, was conducted. Unbiased estimates of MNV were compared with the clinical stage and histological grading according to GS with regard to the prognostic value. Univariate analysis revealed that estimates of MNV, clinical stage, and GS all correlated significantly with disease-specific survival in cases of prostate cancer. Multivariate analysis of all cases also revealed that all of these factors were significant independent prognosticators of disease-specific survival. However, focusing on clinically localized cases (stages A, B, and C), multivariate analysis revealed that the estimation of MNV was the only powerful prognosticator of prostate cancer. This study indicates that the estimation of MNV is prognostically equal or superior to GS in cases of prostate cancer. We emphasized that the estimates of MNV is a more objective method for histological grading to predict the malignant potential of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The role of autophagy is known to be highly complex and context-dependent, leading to both cancer suppression and progression in several tumors including melanoma, breast and prostate cancer. In the present review, recent advances in an understanding of the involvement of autophagy in prostate cancer treatment are described. The regulatory effects of androgens on prostate cancer cell autophagy are particularly discussed in order to highlight the effects of autophagy modulation during androgen deprivation. A critical evaluation of the studies examined in the present review suggests the attractive possibility of autophagy inhibition combined with hormonal therapy as a promising approach for prostate cancer treatment.",prostate cancer
"Neoadjuvant endocrine treatment prior to radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer confined to pelvis has of some value to prevent progression although there are many controversies. In order to improve the prognosis of locally advanced prostate cancer (stage B2 and C), definitive radiotherapy with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy has been investigated. Endocrine therapy reduces the volume of prostate, thus reduces the amount of side effect via reducing the area of irradiated normal tissue. Effect of radiation and that of endocrine therapy to induce apoptosis might be synergistic. The result is favorable although the follow-up period is too short. Further studies are needed to make conclusion.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the leading male malignancy in the Western world. Patients with prostate cancer have an unpredictable clinical course, as three biologically different types of tumor exist.

The prognostic value of established prognostic variables is also discussed.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is among the most common cancers. Although it has a relatively good prognosis, 15 to 30% of men with prostate cancer experience a relapse after radical prostatectomy. Identifying patients with an aggressive tumor will therefore help to improve prostate cancer management. DNA methylation of PITX2 has been established in several studies as a prognostic biomarker for breast and prostate cancer. These case control studies were conducted using research assay components; to facilitate its use in a diagnostic setting, the PITX2 biomarker was transferred to a validated diagnostic platform, the Affymetrix GeneChip System. A customized microarray (Epichip PITX2) was designed using features in high redundancy to ensure a robust determination of the methylation state of the PITX2 promoter. The developed method allowed for accurate assessment of prognosis in prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Determination of PITX2 methylation in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples from a cohort of 157 prostatectomy patients resulted in an excellent level of concordance of the clinical classification, as well as the measured output between the research assay and the Epichip PITX2. These analytical performance results describe the Epichip PITX2 as a robust and reliable diagnostic tool for assessing the methylation status of PITX2, enabling an improved outcome prediction in cancer patients following radical prostatectomy.",prostate cancer
"Microarray expression analysis was used to forecast the roles of differentially co-expressed genes (DCG) and DCG and links in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. In addition, we demonstrate that the relationship between transcriptional factors (TFs) and their targets can be considered a key factor in determining the difference between primary and metastatic prostate cancer. Regulatory impact factors were adopted to calculate the impact of TF. We identified 5 TFs and 29 target genes important in the transition between normal prostate and primary prostate cancer and 2 TFs and 7 target genes important in the transition between primary and metastatic prostate cancer. These results suggest that it may be possible to predict the clinical behavior of prostate cancer based on gene expression analysis.",prostate cancer
"Metastatic prostate cancer remains a prevalent disease in the United States that requires detailed characterization of its pathobiology. In the December 2004 issue of Cancer Research, a comprehensive study by Shah et al. demonstrated that metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer is a collective group of diseases even within the same patient. Understanding the molecular and phenotypic determinants of this heterogeneity is essential in assessing therapeutic outcomes in the management of prostate cancer progression.",prostate cancer
"The aim of this paper was to examine the eligibility criteria, surveillance protocols and oncological outcomes of published active surveillance (AS) series. We also assessed the evidence for utility of novel tools for optimal risk stratification and surveillance of men suitable for AS. A non-systematic literature search of the Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases was performed in April 2015 using medical subject headings and free-text protocol. The search was conducted by applying free-text protocol with the following search terms: ""active surveillance"", ""prostate cancer"", ""prostatic neoplasm"", ""watchful waiting"", ""low risk prostate cancer"" and ""very low risk prostate cancer"". The definition of insignificant disease remains debatable as criteria for patient selection vary among studies. Tools for better selection of candidates and monitoring of the disease process have evolved since the conception of AS, including new biomarkers like phi, mpMRI and alternate biopsy strategies. AS is a sound strategy for reducing overtreatment of men with low-risk, and potentially selected men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer and shorter life expectancy, without compromising overall and cancer specific survival. More data are needed on the optimal integration of the new tools on AS paradigms and on the long-term health impact of AS in different populations.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in men. In addition to improved treatments, strategies to reduce disease risk are urgently required. This review summarises the literature that examines the association between exercise and prostate cancer risk. Between 1989 and 2001, 13 cohort studies were conducted in the US and internationally. Of these, nine showed an association between exercise and decreased prostate cancer risk. Five of 11 case-control studies conducted between 1988 and 2002 reported an association between decreased risk of prostate cancer and high activity levels. Considering all studies performed between 1976 and 2002, 16 out of 27 studies reported reduced risk in men who were most active; in nine out of 16 studies the reduction in risk was statistically significant. Average risk reduction ranged from 10-30%. In aggregate, this evidence suggests a probable link between increased physical exercise and decreased prostate cancer risk. The ability of exercise to modulate hormone levels, prevent obesity, enhance immune function and reduce oxidative stress have all been postulated as mechanisms that may underlie the protective effect of exercise. Exercise may also be of benefit in men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. Overall, study design and control of potential confounding factors varied greatly among studies, possibly contributing to the variation in results. Epidemiological studies that are better controlled, larger in scale and more carefully designed may help to more fully clarify the relationship between exercise and prostate cancer. In addition, intervention trials that test whether exercise programmes can reduce prostate cancer risk are currently underway to rigorously test the ability of exercise to reduce prostate cancer incidence.",prostate cancer
"The classical view of the Golgi apparatus is of a small membranous organelle involved in protein transport and secretion. Recent descriptions of the molecular network connecting the Golgi to other organelles demonstrate the essential roles of the Golgi in cellular activities as a stress sensor, apoptosis trigger, lipid/protein modifier, mitotic checkpoint, and a mediator of malignant transformation. Thus, the Golgi function should have a fundamental impact on cancer cell survival. Prostate cancer is initially responsive to androgenic hormones; however, it almost invariably progresses to a castration-refractory or hormone-insensitive state. Nevertheless, androgen signaling remains active at this stage and is important as a therapeutic target. Certain Golgi-associated molecules have recently been demonstrated to be regulated by androgen action, and the Golgi is emerging as a new therapeutic target in prostate cancer. The key Golgi-associated molecules essential for prostate cancer development and the potential therapeutic options targeting the Golgi apparatus are discussed.",prostate cancer
"Background: Prostate cancer is unique among solid tumors in its proclivity to metastasize primarily to bone. Osseous metastases pose a formidable health threat to patients with metastatic disease, putting them at risk for pain, marrow crowding, fracture, and other sequelae. Treatments directed against bone disease have the potential both to palliate pain and to increase survival. Conclusions: A number of agents exist that have the potential to palliate the effects of osseous metastases and should be routinely applied in the clinical care of the patient with advanced prostate cancer. These include hormones, bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals, chemotherapy, and bisphosphonates. Strategies under investigation aim to eradicate bone disease, and not merely palliate symptoms. These approaches combine those listed above with tumor-directed targeting of osseous disease and manipulation of the biology that underlies the cancer's relationship to bone.",prostate cancer
"Clinical and epidemiological research on prostate cancer is faced with some unusual methodological challenges. The very high prevalence of latent cancer, much of which never becomes clinically manifest, complicates the approach to screening and the conduct of epidemiological studies. Cost-effectiveness issues are especially relevant regarding screening policies, and these trade-offs are complicated by the absence of definitive results on the effectiveness of the various treatment options. The presentation of advanced disease is also unusual, in that the vast majority of patients do not have measurable disease suitable for traditional studies of new chemotherapy agents. These problems necessitate creative approaches to the design and analysis of research studies in this disease: cost-effectiveness analysis is crucial to the evaluation of screening policies; opportunistic designs will be essential to the valid study of cancer etiology, eg, the use of cystoprostatectomy series for studies of epidemiologic risk factors; and posttreatment changes in PSA levels may be valuable as a criterion for screening new agents in advanced disease. Regardless of these new methods, traditional methodological approaches are essential to the valid study of prostate cancer. Randomization is required for valid comparison of treatments and screening strategies. Statistical analysis should observe the intent-to-treat principle whereby patient groups are analyzed with respect to the planned, rather than the delivered therapy, and studies should have sufficiently large sample sizes to reliably distinguish the true effects of the interventions from random statistical fluctuation. Recently, meta-analysis has become popular as a tool for synthesizing the information from available studies on a specific clinical problem. Its most conspicuous success has been in showing the efficacy of adjuvant therapy in breast cancer, for which many individual studies appeared to give conflicting results.64 In this setting there was a large number of published randomized trials, many of which had large sample sizes and long follow-up, and so the meta-analysis was able to show convincingly a small but clinically meaningful treatment effect on long-term disease recurrence and survival. This is similar to the situation in localized prostate cancer in all respects except for the availability of randomized trials. Unfortunately there is no free lunch. This technique can only be applied if the high quality data are available. One must be similarly cautious in applying decision analytic techniques (and also cost-effectiveness analysis) to try to resolve clinical dilemmas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",prostate cancer
"The cure of advanced prostate cancer (PCa) will be achieved through the clinical application of biological observations. To achieve this, a new classification of human PCa is needed. Unlike in previous classifications of PCa which were based on anatomic determinates of outcome, we propose to integrate emerging PCa biology into this taxonomy. Three biologically based categories were identified (amphotropic, clonal expansion, and heterotopic), and each has unique features that influence therapy selection. It is unlikely that any single agent or modality will successfully control PCa. It is hoped that the classification and trial designs we propose will facilitate the application of integrated treatment and prevention strategies.",prostate cancer
"African American men have a higher incidence of prostate cancer than white men, and also a higher rate of death due to prostate cancer. Although both biologic and socioeconomic factors may be to blame, better screening in this population may help to close the gap.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a serious multidimensional disorder that arises because of misrepresentation of signaling cascades and acquired resistance against apoptosis. It is progressively becoming more insurmountable because of rheostat like switching of oncogenic signaling in androgen dependent and androgen depleted microenvironment. Additionally, oncogenic fusion proteins have been explored in prostate cancer tissues thus adding another layer of complexity to the targeting of protein network in cancer cell and generate hurdles in the standardization of therapy. In this Review we briefly describe identified oncogenic fusion transcripts in prostate cancer and suggest utilization of this biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis alongwith standard PSA and immunohistochemistry analysis in Pakistan. We also provide overview of animal model studies to interpret the efficacy of vitamins.",prostate cancer
"Over the past several years, the clinical presentation of prostate cancer has evolved so that more patients than ever before are presenting with clinically localized disease. However, a significant number of men continue to present with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, or go on to develop metastasis after failing local therapies. Despite our better understanding of the biological principles and newer therapies, metastatic prostate cancer remains a lethal disease. Androgen ablation continues to be the first, most effective line of treatment for advanced/metastatic prostate cancer. Newer chemotherapy combinations with increasing activity are being identified in hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Based on novel targets, new treatment strategies are being developed and incorporated into clinical trials. Ultimately, the impact of these evolving treatments on advanced/hormone-resistant prostate cancer can best be assessed by well-designed phase III trials, many of which are now being launched or awaiting completion.",prostate cancer
"Whereas androgen deprivation and chemotherapy have become the cornerstone of therapy for advanced prostate cancer, novel therapies are being developed that may expand upon currently available treatments. The identification of antigens expressed by prostate tissue and/or prostate cancer that are recognized by T cells or antibodies creates opportunities to develop novel immunotherapeutic approaches including tumor vaccines. Proteins expressed in prostate cancer-including prostate-specific antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase, and prostate membrane antigen-have been used as immunologic targets for immunotherapy. Moreover, innovations in cancer genomics and proteomics also will aid in the identification of immunologic targets. Emerging trials have demonstrated that immunotherapy may generate not only immune responses in patients but also clinical responses. Future studies will be directed at capitalizing on these findings.",prostate cancer
"New approaches for prostate cancer are needed due to limitations of current therapies for the treatment in advanced stages of the disease. In fact, there is no effective treatment for these patients. Development in molecular biology research on prostate cancer has improved the knowledge of common alterations encoded in DNA sequence, which may be useful as targets for prostate cancer approach. In this review we give an overview of current gene therapy concepts, the most common gene alterations in prostate cancer and the gene therapy treatment strategies.",prostate cancer
"Current therapy for advanced prostate cancer is hampered by the propensity of the disease to progress from an androgen-dependent state to an androgen-independent state. Current treatment for advanced disease is palliative. Therefore, the therapeutic goal for prostate cancer treatment today is to arrest the disease at an early state when it is still localized to the gland. The standard treatment for clinically localized disease is radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy by way of external beam irradiation or local radioactive seed implants (brachytherapy). In advanced disease, the use of radiation therapy is limited to palliation of pain secondary to bone metastases and for spinal cord compression. Tracking residual disease and predicting outcome is limited to following the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) production, evaluating for bone or solid organ metastasis, and analyzing their preoperative clinical stage, PSA and Gleason's score. Apoptosis as a molecular process of genetically regulated cell death has a critical endpoint that coincides with the goal of successful treatment of human malignancies. Since in cancer treatment the therapeutic goal is to trigger tumor-selective cell death, activation of the apoptotic pathway in prostatic tumor cells offers attractive and potentially effective therapeutic targets. As our understanding of the vital role of apoptosis in the development and growth of the prostate gland has expanded, numerous genes that encode apoptotic regulators have been identified that are severely impaired in prostate tumors. Human prostate cancer cells undergo apoptosis in response to androgen ablation, chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing irradiation. The expression of apoptotic modulators within individual prostate tumors appears to correlate with the cancer cell's sensitivity to traditional therapeutic modalities, including radiotherapy. No strict correlation between radiation-induced apoptosis and longevity of prostate cancer patients has emerged, possibly because the ability to achieve an initial remission alone does not adequately predict long-term outcome and patient survival. In this review we summarize the current understanding of the effects of radiation therapy on prostatic tumor cells within the context of the therapeutic significance of radiation-induced apoptosis in the effective elimination of androgen independent prostate cancer cells. As we enter a new millenium, identification of distinct molecular markers predictive of therapeutic response of prostatic tumors to radiation therapy may afford alternative prognostic indicators in optimizing our treatment protocols for advanced disease.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: We tested the diagnostic accuracy of shear wave elastography to detect and phenotypically characterize prostate cancer compared with whole mount radical prostatectomy histopathology. Materials and methods: In this prospective, protocol driven, diagnostic accuracy study 212 consecutive men undergoing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer were recruited. Quantitative stiffness data on the prostate gland were obtained in each patient using an endocavitary transrectal transducer before laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Those data were compared with a detailed histopathological examination of the radical prostatectomy specimen using 3-dimensional printing mold based technology to ensure an improved image histology orientation. ROC curves were assessed between the groups. Results: Quantitative stiffness data estimated in kPa were significantly higher in malignant compared with benign areas. At a cutoff of 82.6 kPa the sensitivity and specificity of shear wave elastography were 96.8% and 67.8%, respectively (p <0.01). Significant differences were observed for different cancer grades with the Young moduli, including 91.6, 102.3 and 131.8 kPa for low grade (Gleason score 6), intermediate grade (Gleason score 7) and high grade (Gleason score 8 or greater) prostate cancer, respectively (p <0.05). Shear wave elastography also detected capsular breaches with significant prediction of prostate cancer pathological staging. Potential limitations include selection bias and study being single center site. Conclusions: Quantitative shear wave elastography via the transrectal approach accurately detected cancer foci and revealed significant differences between cancerous and benign tissue. Moreover, this technique can be used to reliably phenotype prostate cancer aggressiveness.",prostate cancer
"Adjuvant hormonal therapy has been demonstrated to be able to delay disease progression in nonmetastatic prostate cancer. To date, however, a favorable impact on survival has only been demonstrated in lymph-node-positive disease and in external-beam radiotherapy series with locally advanced and probably mainly micrometastatic tumors. The Bicalutamide Early Prostate Cancer Program is the largest study under way to define the role of adjuvant treatment in early prostate cancer and identify subgroups of patients likely to benefit from immediate hormonal therapy. At the time of the most recently published analysis, the risk of objective clinical progression was significantly reduced in the bicalutamide arm (hazards ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.51-0.66, p < 0.0001). However, further maturation of data is needed to see whether this difference will lead to a survival advantage.",prostate cancer
"The sensitivity and specificity of prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD), a quotient of serum PSA and prostate volume, in the detection of localized prostate cancer was analysed in a prospective study. A total of 235 patients were examined, 145 without prostate cancer and 90 patients before radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer. PSAD was determined by dividing the serum level of PSA by the volume of the entire prostate (estimated by transrectal ultrasound) and multiplying by 100. Using a PSAD of 15, the specificity achieved in our collective was the same as with an absolute PSA value of 4 ng/ml (88.9-90%). On the other hand, with the PSAD of 15 we also found the same sensitivity as with an ab-solute PSA of 10 ng/ml (75.2-76.5%).",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death after lung cancer. The use of radioactive seeds (i.e., brachytherapy) to provide radiation therapy is one of the three recommended treatment options for localized carcinoma of the prostate. This technique places the radioactive source in close proximity to the malignancy and provides a predictable dose of radiation to a confined area, thus sparing nearby healthy tissue. The technique is performed under transrectal ultrasonography. Nursing care for the patient undergoing this ambulatory surgery procedure focuses on detailed preoperative instructions and highly technical intraoperative care, followed by individualized postoperative care.",prostate cancer
"The prostate specific antigen (PSA) has had an enormous impact on the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.

"In the developed world, prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis in men. Although prostate cancer initially presents as a non life-threatening disease, 90% of patients will develop castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which preludes distant metastasis and is largely accountable for prostate cancer associated deaths. This is because as yet, there are no viable molecular therapeutic targets for effective treatment of CRPC. It is now widely accepted that cancer cells can alter their metabolic profile during the course of tumourgenesis and metastasis such that they are able to survive in oxygen and nutrient-poor environments. This work was aimed towards gaining greater mechanistic understanding of how such 'stresses' in the tumour microenvironment impact on both androgen sensitive (LNCaP) and androgen independent (LNCaP-abl and LNCaP-abl-Hof) prostate cancer cell lines. Here we have applied technically robust and reproducible label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis for comprehensive proteomic profiling of prostate cancer cell lines under nutrient deficient (low glucose) conditions. This led to the identification of approximately 4,000 proteins - one of the largest protein datasets for prostate cancer cell lines established to date. The biological and clinical significance of proteins showing a significant change in expression as result of low glucose conditions was established. Novel, intuitive workflows were subsequently implemented to ensure the verification of selected proteins of interest in a robust, reproducible and high throughput manner. Overall, these data suggest that this strategy supports identification of protein biomarkers of prostate cancer progression and potential therapeutic targets for CRPC.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death. The widespread introduction into the clinical practice of test for prostate specific antigen (PSA) led to an increase in the number of prostate biopsies performed. At the same time, a decrease in the threshold of age-specific PSA standards has resulted in an increase in the number of unnecessary biopsies. In this regard, a need has arisen for new prostate cancer biomarkers. PCA3 is a non-coding mRNA that is exclusively expressed by prostate cells. Currently, three generations of test diagnostic systems based on the quantitative analysis of the PCA3 mRNA in the urine or its cell sediment has already developed, and they differ in the type of material studied and the method for estimating the amount of PCA3 mRNA. Clinical studies of the developed test systems have shown that a high level of PCA3 expression in the patients urine correlates with the probability of detecting prostate cancer. PCA3 test has higher positive and negative predictive values than previously used PSA test. These data are repeatedly confirmed by studies conducted in different clinics. Thus, the introduction of the method of quantitative determination of PCA3 in clinical practice can significantly improve the efficiency of diagnosis of prostate cancer and reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies.",prostate cancer
"Scientists and clinicians at Johns Hopkins have been working since 1987 to uncover the genetic pathogenesis of prostate cancer. A patient query about the hereditary nature of the disease led to data collection on family history, followed by segregation and linkage analyses.

"Faced with equivalent treatments in terms of control of localised prostate cancer, by treatments as different as radical prostectomy and radiotherapy, the analysis of the physical and psychosocial consequences of each treatment is indispensable in determining the therapeutic options proposed to a patient. Current information on the quality of life after treatment of localised and metastatic prostate cancer show effects after treatment that are specific to this pathology (urinary, sexual and digestive problems) and general (physical state and functional capacity, capacity to accomplish all forms of work, capacity to maintain social relations...). These effects nevertheless differ depending of the stage of the disease and the type of treatment.",prostate cancer

"Impaired Ca2+ signaling in prostate cancer contributes to several cancer hallmarks, such as enhanced proliferation and migration and a decreased ability to induce apoptosis. Na+ influx via transient receptor potential melastatin 4 channel (TRPM4) can reduce store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) by decreasing the driving force for Ca2+. In patients with prostate cancer, gene expression of TRPM4 is elevated. Recently, TRPM4 was identified as a cancer driver gene in androgen-insensitive prostate cancer.We investigated TRPM4 protein expression in cancer tissue samples from 20 patients with prostate cancer. We found elevated TRPM4 protein levels in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and prostate cancer tissue compared to healthy tissue. In primary human prostate epithelial cells (hPEC) from healthy tissue and in the androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3, TRPM4 mediated large Na+ currents. We demonstrated significantly increased SOCE after siRNA targeting of TRPM4 in hPEC and DU145 cells. In addition, knockdown of TRPM4 reduced migration but not proliferation of DU145 and PC3 cells. Taken together, our data identify TRPM4 as a regulator of SOCE in hPEC and DU145 cells, demonstrate a role for TRPM4 in cancer cell migration and suggest that TRPM4 is a promising potential therapeutic target.",prostate cancer
"Transrectal ultrasonography of the prostate is a diagnostic technique allowing visualization of the internal anatomy of the prostate gland, the seminal vesicles, and the prostatic urethra.

"Objective: Review of the oncological results of the radical prostatectomy as initial treatment of prostate cancer, according to the surgical approach and the risk stratification using D'Amico risk groups. Materials and methods: Review of literature using Medline databases and MedScience based on scientific relevance. Research focused on the oncological results of the radical prostatectomy in series and meta-analysis published since 10 years, taking into consideration the surgical approach if mentioned. Results: The characteristics of the operated tumor highly impact the local control authenticated by the pathologic stage and the rates of positive surgical margins (PSM), in addition to the survival and the biochemical recurrence. Surgical technique adapted according to the tumor treated, was a constant challenge to the urologist, who counter balance between the oncological control and the conservation of urinary and sexual function by conditioning the type of radical prostatectomy. Results of radical prostatectomy acceptable in terms of PSM and survival are not influenced by the surgical approach but by the degree of surgical experience. Conclusion: Results of radical prostatectomy show the efficient local control of prostate cancer, taking into consideration the oncological rules and indications validated by multidisciplinary meetings, based on the national (CCAFU) and European oncological guidelines. Tendency is going toward considering radical prostatectomy indicated for patients with higher risk of disease progression, so integrating surgery in a multidisciplinary personalized approach.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men and is the second highest cause of cancer death in men of all races.

"Although the morbidity rate of prostate cancer has increased with 2.3 times in these 10 years in Japan, little is known about the changes in the prevalence of latent prostate cancer. To understand changes in the prevalence of latent prostate cancer, a retrospective analysis was performed. Forensic autopsy findings from Tochigi Prefecture between September 2012 and February 2014 were collected. Two cross sections, from the base and apex of the prostate, were examined histopathologically. The prevalence of latent prostate cancer was compared with findings from forensic autopsies performed between August 2002 and July 2005 in the same region. The prevalence of latent prostate cancer in both groups was similar, showing an overall prevalence of 13.6% and 12.2% and a Gleason score >6 of 6.2% and 7.1%, respectively. When prevalence was compared by cause of death, the values were similar for both groups. The prevalence of latent prostate cancer in this Japanese population did not show any significant change over the past 10 years. The dramatic increase in morbidity rate for prostate cancer could be from the increase in prostate-specific antigen screening and subsequent referral to urologists.",prostate cancer

"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging tool of choice in the evaluation of prostate cancer. The main applications of MR imaging in the management of prostate cancer are: (1) to guide targeted biopsy when prostate cancer is clinically suspected and previous ultrasound-guided biopsy results are negative; (2) to localize and stage prostate cancer and provide a roadmap for treatment planning; and (3) to detect residual or locally recurrent cancer after treatment. Other MR techniques such as proton MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) complement conventional MR imaging by providing metabolic and functional information that can improve the accuracy of prostate cancer detection and characterization. In everyday clinical practice, and to account for patient comfort, MR imaging studies are limited to 1 h. To obtain consistently high-quality images, a well-designed protocol is necessary. Routine MR imaging can be supplemented by other MR techniques such as MRSI, DWI or CE-MRI depending on the expertise available and the clinical questions that need to be answered. This review summarizes the role of MR imaging in the management of prostate cancer and describes practical approaches to implementing anatomic, metabolic and functional MR imaging techniques in the clinic.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common carcinoma of the elderly man and holds the third place in the ranking of cancer-specific mortality. However, mortality rates of 3 % are low, and half of the patients will die from intercurrent disease. Due to the significantly improved diagnostic methods and the increasing use of PSA screening, there has been a stage migration towards early tumour stages that are prognostically heterogeneous and require differentiated treatment. Based on the discussions of the Joint Federal Committee (G-BA) and the conceptual work of the MDS, the Competence Centre Oncology of the MDK, the IQWIG and the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds (GKV-Spitzenverband), a prospective randomised multicentre trial was developed comparing the four treatments actually recommended by the German and European guidelines for localised prostate cancer (radical prostatectomy, percutaneous radiotherapy and permanent seed implantation and active surveillance) allowing a rejection of one or two treatment options. The trial is expected to start at the beginning of next year.",prostate cancer
"For advanced prostate cancer, hormonal therapy has been utilized as the first choice of treatment. In general, initial hormonal therapy consists of androgen deprivation therapy by means of bilateral orchiectomy, LHRH agonist or LHRH antagonist. It has been attempted to improve efficacy of hormonal therapy by several methods including combined androgen blockade (CAB: castration+antiandrogen), intermittent hormonal therapy, or chemohormonal therapy using docetaxel. The results of clinical trials demonstrated benefit of each hormonal therapy in the selected patients with advanced prostate cancer. In future, it is expected that personalized hormonal therapy would be established based on understanding of characteristics and selection of good candidates for several types of hormonal therapies.",prostate cancer
"Recent work directed toward understanding the molecular features of advanced prostate cancers has revealed a relatively high incidence of both germline and somatic alterations in genes involved in DNA damage repair (DDR). Many of these alterations likely play a critical role in the pathogenesis of more aggressive prostate cancers-leading to genomic instability and an increased probability of the development of lethal disease. However, because the ability to repair DNA damage with a high degree of fidelity is critical to an individual cell's survival, tumor cells harboring alterations in DDR pathway genes are also more susceptible to drugs that induce DNA damage or impair alternative DNA repair pathways. In addition, because the genomic instability that results from these alterations can lead to an inherently higher number of mutations than occur in cells with intact DDR pathways, patients with genomic instability may be more likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors, presumably owing to a correspondingly high neoantigen burden. In this review, we discuss the emerging molecular taxonomy that is providing a framework for precision oncology initiatives aimed at developing targeted approaches for treating prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer, the most frequent non-cutaneous malignancy in aging men, is a growing medical problem, representing the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. Despite its high morbidity, the etiology of prostate cancer remains largely unknown. Several studies have documented hormonal imbalance, such as alteration in androgens and estrogens, obesity, family history and growth factors, as risk factors in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. Insulin is a growth-promoting hormone that is reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of various malignancies, such as breast and bladder cancers. Insulin is known to increase cancer risk through its effect on cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. In the last decade, converging evidence from epidemiological and clinical studies suggests that the insulin is involved in the tumorigenesis and neoplastic growth of the prostate. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the possible causal relationship between insulin and prostate cancer, such as the sympathoexcitatory effect of insulin, alteration of sex hormone metabolism, insulin-like growth factor pathway, signal transduction mechanism and dyslipidemia. The present paper reviews relevant existing studies related to the role of insulin in the pathogenesis of prostate carcinoma.",prostate cancer
"A recent publication in Science demonstrates the ability of prostate cancer cells to switch lineages from one that is dependent on androgen signaling to a cell type that is not.

"Since the use of prostate-specific antigen screening has become widespread, prostate cancer at clinical T4 stage has become rare. Most bladder invasion is actually detected on radical prostatectomy specimens as a microscopic bladder neck involvement (BNI). The 2002 TNM classification system classified prostate cancer with BNI within a unified pT4 category, and rendered it equivalent to invasion into pelvic wall musculature or external sphincter. This decision is controversial. Various series have studied the clinical relevance and the impact of BNI on prognosis. Our evidence-based review provides support to the assignment of BNI within the subset of pT3 stage, and suggests that further improvement of the actual TNM staging system should be considered. However, BNI remains strongly associated with adverse pathology and should be regarded as a factor that worsens the prognosis of the underlying tumor stage.",prostate cancer
"The high mortality rate associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) underscores the need for improving therapeutic options for this patient population. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential of vascular targeting in prostate cancer. Experimental studies were carried out in subcutaneous and orthotopic Myc-CaP prostate tumors implanted into male FVB mice to examine the efficacy of a novel microtubule targeted vascular disrupting agent (VDA), EPC2407 (Crolibulin™). A non-invasive multimodality imaging approach based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and ultrasound (US) was utilized to guide preclinical trial design and monitor tumor response to therapy. Imaging results were correlated with histopathologic assessment, tumor growth and survival analysis. Contrast-enhanced MRI revealed potent antivascular activity of EPC2407 against subcutaneous and orthotopic Myc-CaP tumors. Longitudinal BLI of Myc-CaP tumors expressing luciferase under the androgen response element (Myc-CaP/ARE-luc) revealed changes in AR signaling and reduction in intratumoral delivery of luciferin substrate following castration suggestive of reduced blood flow. This reduction in blood flow was validated by US and MRI. Combination treatment resulted in sustained vascular suppression, inhibition of tumor regrowth and conferred a survival benefit in both models. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of vascular targeting in combination with androgen deprivation against prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"In the present review we discuss expenditure on prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment and follow-up and evaluate the cost of prostate cancer and its management in different countries. Prostate cancer costs were identified from published data and internet sources. To provide up-to-date comparisons, costs were inflated to 2010 levels and the most recent exchange rates were applied. A high proportion of the costs are incurred in the first year after diagnosis; in 2006, this amounted to 106.7-179.0 million euros (€) in the European countries where these data were available (UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands). In the USA, the total estimated expenditure on prostate cancer was 9.862 billion US dollars ($) in 2006. The mean annual costs per patient in the USA were $10,612 in the initial phase after diagnosis, $2134 for continuing care and $33,691 in the last year of life. In Canada, hospital and drug expenditure on prostate cancer totalled C$103.1 million in 1998. In Australia, annual costs for prostate cancer care in 1993-1994 were 101.1 million Australian dollars. Variations in costs between countries were attributed to differences in incidence and management practices. Per patient costs depend on cancer stage at diagnosis, survival and choice of treatment. Despite declining mortality rates, costs are expected to rise owing to increased diagnosis, diagnosis at an earlier stage and increased survival. Unless new strategies are devised to increase the efficiency of healthcare provision, the economic burden of prostate cancer will continue to rise.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common solid-organ cancer affecting the male population. Men with metastatic prostate cancer treated with androgen ablation therapy often respond rapidly, with improvement in bone pain and decreases in serum prostate-specific antigen. However, almost all patients progress to the castrate-resistant state and until recently chemotherapy was the only treatment available with proven survival benefit. Abiraterone is a new class of anti-androgen with proven survival benefit post-chemotherapy. In this review we discuss the characteristics of abiraterone and the clinical trials that led to its approval for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The biological diversity of prostate cancer confounds standardization of therapy. Advances in molecular profiling suggest that differences in the genetic composition of tumors significantly contribute to the complexity of the disease. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a key genetic process underlying biological diversity. During alternative splicing, coding and noncoding regions of a single gene are rearranged to generate several messenger RNA transcripts yielding distinct protein isoforms with differing biological functions. Misregulation of the splicing machinery and mutations in key regulatory elements affect splicing of cancer-relevant genes. In prostate cancer, aberrant and alternative splicing generates proteins that influence cell phenotypes and survival of patients. Splicing events may be exploited for clinical benefit, and technological advances are beginning to uncover novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Since splicing mediates information transfer from the genome to the proteome, it adds an important dimension to '-omics'-based molecular signatures used to individualize care of patients.",prostate cancer
"It has been suggested that chromosome 7q32 contains genes that influence the progression of prostate cancer from latent to invasive disease. In an attempt to confirm this linkage to prostate cancer aggressiveness, 100 German prostate cancer families were genotyped using a panel of eight polymorphic markers on chromosome 7q. We used a multipoint allele sharing method based upon a likelihood ratio test implemented in GENEHUNTERPLUS v1.2 in order to calculate the nonparametric Z(lr) and the associated LOD scores. We applied the aggressiveness of prostate cancer given by the pathological tumour grade of each individual, and the mean age of onset of a family as covariates, and constructed two weighted models. The first (weight(0-1) model) puts weights on families with at least two cases of GIII prostate cancer. The second (weight(0-2) model) also adds weights to families with early and late onset cancer respectively. The unweighted analysis gave no evidence of linkage to chromosome 7q. The Z(lr) scores increased when including the covariates, to 2.60 (P=0.005) using the weight(0-1) and to 3.02 (P=0.001) using the weight(0-2) model for late onset prostate cancer. The associated LOD scores were respectively 1.47 (P=0.009) and 1.98 (P=0.002). The markers that gave most evidence for linkage were exactly in the range of the published prostate cancer aggressiveness region. Our results support a widespread relevance of this locus and suggest that aggressive and late onset prostate cancer is linked to chromosme 7q31-33 in the German population.",prostate cancer
"In prostate cancer, there is considerable evidence that tumors promote immune tolerance starting early in the disease. By suppressing tumors and activating immune system homeostatic mechanisms, chemotherapy may help overcome this tumor-induced immune tolerance. As such, chemotherapy may therefore support improved results from novel immune-modulating therapies. Prostate cancer is particularly suited for active immunotherapy because prostate tumor cells express a number of distinctive surface antigens. Sipuleucel-T, which has recently been approved in the United States, is an active immunotherapy that triggers T-cell responses against prostate cancer. An exploratory analysis of phase III trial participants found a substantial survival benefit to receiving docetaxel some months after sipuleucel-T. However, VITAL-2, a phase III trial investigating a prostate cancer therapeutic vaccine plus concurrent docetaxel versus standard docetaxel therapy in advanced prostate cancer, observed lower overall survival with the vaccine regimen. This trial highlights major unresolved questions concerning the optimum choice, dosing, and timing of chemotherapy relative to active immunotherapy. Patient characteristics, prostate cancer disease stage, and treatment history also may influence the response to combined therapy. Advances in biomarker validation and trial design are needed to efficiently investigate these issues.",prostate cancer
"The prevalence of prostate cancer is increasing, which is one of the leading causes of malignancy-associated deaths of males. Because the early symptoms of prostate cancer are not obvious, 20% of the patients have metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis. The low rate of early diagnosis of prostate cancer has contributed to a higher mortality rate in China than in Europe and the United States. Highly specific and sensitive diagnostic markers exist in the blood, urine and semen of prostate cancer patients. Combined laboratory techniques can improve the rate of the early diagnosis of prostate cancer, help early treatment, and prolong the survival of the patients.",prostate cancer
"Fifty patients with extracapsular prostate cancer without known distant metastases were included in a protocol of surveillance followed by deferred treatment of progression. The median observed followup time was 78 months. The risk of developing distant metastases, if not dying before, was 24% and 37% at 5 and 9 years, respectively. The risk of dying of prostate cancer, if not dying of other diseases before, was 12% and 30% at 5 and 9 years, respectively. Thus, the cancer specific survival was 88% at 5 years and 70% at 9 years.",prostate cancer
"In an attempt to determine the role of environmental factors in the etiology of prostate cancer, we compared the clinical-pathological findings of prostate cancer among Japanese Americans in Hawaii and Japanese living in Japan. Our study showed that prostate cancer in Japanese living in Japan is more advanced than in Japanese Americans. The findings indicate that screening for prostate cancer in Japan is far behind that in the USA. The difference in level of cancer screening also precluded our attempt to analyse environmental factors contributing to prostate cancer progression in the two groups. The variation in method of clinical detection of prostate cancer between the USA and Japan is also likely to contribute to the apparent difference in the incidence of the disease.",prostate cancer
"Aim: To determine the diagnostic quality of transrectal sonoelastography (SE) in the prediction and localisation of prostate cancer, we prospectively examined patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy in our urology department. Methods: From April 2010 to January 2011, 61 patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent preoperative transrectal gray-scale (b-mode) ultrasound and SE of the prostate. Cancer-suspicious areas were documented for b-mode and SE, dividing the prostate into six topographic sectors. Suspicious areas in both modalities were compared to tumour localisation in the prostatectomy specimen. Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative predictive values were calculated for both investigation techniques. Results: Prostate cancer was present in 232 of 366 pathological sectors (62 %). B-mode ultrasound showed 113 suspicious sectors, while SE indicated prostate cancer in 157 areas. The precise localisation of at least one pathologically confirmed cancerous lesion was possible in 42/61 (69 %) patients by b-mode ultrasound and 56/61 (92 %) patients by SE (P<0.005). The sensitivity for b-mode ultrasound was 33 % and specificity 74 %. For SE sensitivity was 53 %, while specificity was 74 %. Conclusions: SE offers a more precise localisation of prostate carcinoma than conventional ultrasound. To investigate the possible advantages of SE in during prostate biopsy and its value in the prediction of extracapsular cancer further studies are required.",prostate cancer
"Introduction: Motion of the prostate is problematic in the accurate delivery of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer. This study investigated the relationship between body mass index (BMI), an easily measured indicator of obesity, and prostate motion. Methods: Prostate motion during EBRT was assessed by measuring the displacement of fiducial markers implanted within the prostate in 130 prostate cancer patients. Interfractional motion was corrected on daily imaging through pre-treatment cone-beam-computed tomography (CBCT) and intrafractional motion measured using movie sequences captured using an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) during treatment delivery. Results: There was no statistically significant relationship between the mean intrafractional motion and BMI, except in the left-right (LR) translation (P = 0.049) over the study population. For each BMI category, there was no statistical significance (P > 0.05) between any of the translations/rotations except LR (P = 0.003). Conclusion: While intrafractional motion is an important consideration, prostate motion cannot be reliably predicted through measurement of patient's BMI.",prostate cancer
"Objective: To investigate the expression and significance of Clusterin in normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. Methods: Clusterin expression in samples of 12 normal prostate, 15 BPH, and 56 prostate cancer were studied by immunohistochemical stain. Results: Of 83 cases, 67 are positive or weak positive (81%). The rate of positive or weak positive for normal prostate, BPH and prostate cancer was 17% (2/12), 73% (11/15), and 96% (54/56) respectively. The expression level of Clusterin in prostate cancer was much higher than in normal prostate (t = 8.82, P < 0.01). BPH (t = 7.63, P < 0.01) was related positively with pathological grade (r = 0.649, P < 0.01) and stage (r = 0.609, P < 0.01) of prostate cancer. Conclusion: Clusterin may play an important role in the biological characteristics of prostate cancer by the anti-apoptosis pathway.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is generally multifocal and consists of a dominant focus-measured by tumour volume and deemed the index lesion-and one or more separate, secondary tumour foci of smaller volume. Much laboratory and clinical evidence has shown that we need to rethink how we regard low-grade and low-volume prostate lesions. In this Personal View, we discuss why small, low-grade Gleason pattern prostate lesions, which are currently designated as prostate cancer, could be regarded as non-malignant. These lesions either do not meet the criteria of the hallmarks of cancer or robust evidence that they do so is absent, by contrast with large lesions with a high Gleason grade, which seem to cause most metastatic disease.",prostate cancer
"It has long been known that obesity modestly increases the risk of prostate cancer mortality. Only recently, however, have studies examined whether this association is due to an increased risk of aggressive disease and/or worse outcomes following initial diagnosis and treatment. This distinction is important, because if obesity increases the risk of metastasis and death following treatment, weight loss could be an effective adjunct treatment. We now have good evidence that obesity increases the risk of aggressive prostate cancer, but reduces the risk of low-grade, nonaggressive cancer. In addition, several studies have found that obesity increases the risk of biochemical recurrence following prostatectomy; however, the few studies that have examined more definitive end points, metastases and death, have been less consistent. Furthermore, there are no studies that have examined whether weight loss after diagnosis favorably affects prostate cancer outcome. While accepting the current limitations in our knowledge base, it is our opinion that it is appropriate for physicians to counsel their patients to lose weight following prostate cancer diagnosis and motivate this change in behavior by emphasising the likely benefit of improving long-term outcome.",prostate cancer
"The management of localized prostate cancer in the elderly is problematic. In many cases, death from other causes may occur before death from prostate cancer. Choosing the optimal therapy requires properly counseling patients about the relative risks and benefits from each treatment option, including watchful waiting. Conservative management is a reasonable alternative for managing this disease.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is now the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death from cancer among men. Several studies have shown a frequency of autopsy-detected cancer of 40% in men over 50 years of age. In contrast, the lifetime probability of prostate cancer being diagnosed clinically is only 8%. Thus histologically documented prostate cancer only becomes clinically relevant if the tumors are > 0.5 cm3 and the life expectancy exceeds 10 years. Therapy with curative intention is only possible for organ confined disease. Because disease specific survival is about 80-90% after 10 years for conservative treatment of organ confined disease, early detection of prostate cancer is useful for patients with a life expectancy > 10 years. Organ confined prostate cancer is usually asymptomatic. The use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) combined with digital rectal examination (DRE) results in a 2-3 fold increase in prostatic carcinoma detection rate, especially of organ confined disease, by PSA. In men with a minimally elevated PSA-value of 4-10 ng/ml (Hybritech Assays), 25% will have a prostatic carcinoma regardless of the finding of the DRE, which would have reached clinical significance in the follow-up. The indication for biopsy should be established at an early date. There is no support for the common opinion that early detection programs detect clinically unimportant cancers. 95% of tumor volumes are > 0.5 cm3. Furthermore only 3-5% of subjects show prostate cancer in detection programs though 8% will develop clinical symptoms of prostate cancer during their lifetime. This difference is a reason for longitudinal programs with PSA and DRE control once a year, as proposed by the American Cancer Society and the American and Canadian Urological Association, in contrast to other health care organizations, which would wait with general screening until data from prospective randomized trials with beneficial effects of screening are available. To introduce prostate cancer therapy with curative intention for symptomatic patients as well, the cancer should be detected below a PSA level of 10 ng/ml. Insufficient specificity of PSA (2-4 patients have to undergo biopsies to detect one cancer patient) is still an unsolved problem.",prostate cancer
"Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in the detection of prostate cancer. Materials and methods: The experimental group consisted of 20 patients with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy. The sensitivity, positive predictive value and accuracy of the detection of prostate cancer in the 12 sections of the peripheral zone were calculated for prostate biopsy alone, 1H-MRS alone and the combination of these methods, respectively. Results: The sensitivity, the positive predictive value, and the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of prostate cancer were 43.7%, 68.9% and 54.6%, respectively, with prostate biopsy alone; 60.6%, 87.8% and 71.4% with 1H-MRS alone; and 88.7%, 88.7% and 87.4% with the combination of biopsy and 1H-MRS, respectively. Combined use of biopsy and 1H-MRS significantly improved the sensitivity, positive predictive value and accuracy of the diagnosis. Conclusion: 1H-MRS together with biopsy might improve the diagnostic accuracy in prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The incidence of prostate cancer has increased in Japan recently and is developing into a life-threatening disease for many Japanese men. This is a result of several convergent factors including the adoption of a Western lifestyle, the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, and an increased population of advanced years in Japanese men. Although there is much information to date relating to molecular events underlying the etiology of prostate cancer, it is still unclear as to how and when these genetic alterations occur in each step of tumorigenesis. One fruitful area of investigation has been in the analysis of chromosomal abnormalities commonly observed in prostate cancer. However, no single candidate gene has been definitely identified in cancer initiation and/or progression; in addition, less research has been devoted to understanding the molecular events that underlie tumor histogenesis in terms of likely precursor lesions, such as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). This article reviews the current knowledge of the molecular pathology of prostate cancer, including its histogenesis, genetic and epigenetic alterations, and hereditary factors.",prostate cancer
"Cancer of the prostate is one of the most commonly diagnosed solid malignancies and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men living in Italy. With an ageing population, the number of men living with early stages of prostate cancer is expected to increase. There is an impelling need to prevent the onset of the cancer or delay the progression of carcinogenesis in this organ. The chemoprevention of cancer is a relatively new concept defined as the administration of pharmacological agents (drug or diet-derived supplements) to prevent, delay or reverse the carcinogenesis. Epidemiological data showing ethnic and geographic variations in the incidence of, and mortality from, prostate cancer have suggested that the consumption of dietary factors may be protective. There is increasing evidence that diet (particularly dietary fat intake) may play a significant role in early prostate carcinogenesis. Dietary micronutrients and antioxidants are under intense scrutiny. These factors include the vitamin D and E, lycopene, selenium, zinc, poliphenols, isoflavonoids, and phytoestrogens (especially soy products and green tea). The old Mediterranean diet (based on cereals, vegetables, polyunsaturated fats, fruits, fish and low quantities of dairy products and meat) is now sparingly adopted because of the globalisation of the food chain which now involves also our country. Nevertheless, our traditional dietary habits are considered of great value in the prevention of cardiovascular or cancerous diseases and particularly of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Androgen deprivation has been the standard therapy for advanced and metastatic prostate cancer for over half a century, as prostate tumors are initially dependent on androgens for growth and survival. Unfortunately, in most patients undergoing androgen ablation, relapse (recurrent tumor growth) eventually occurs. The actions of the principal androgens, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are mediated via androgen receptors (ARs), ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Because of the presence of transcriptionally active ARs in tumors from recurrent or androgen-independent disease, there is a heightened interest in new therapeutic paradigms that target the AR and its regulatory pathways. The regulation of AR levels is highly complex with control exerted by several pathways and in a cell-, tissue-, and developmental-stage specific manner. Androgens are important regulators of AR mRNA and protein through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. This article reviews the evidence implicating the AR in recurrent prostate cancer and discusses the multiple mechanisms that regulate AR levels in normal and neoplastic cells. The complexity of AR regulation suggests that there will be an ample array of potential new drug targets for modulating levels of this receptor, a key signaling molecule in prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is common, and recent efforts in clinical management have focused on identifying patients who could be candidates from less aggressive management or who could benefit from more aggressive therapy. As prostate cancer histology, especially Gleason score, plays a critical role in predicting patient outcomes, attempts have been made to refine histologic classification and reporting in prostate cancer to facilitate patient risk stratification. This review discusses recent updates in prostate cancer grading and reporting.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: Patients with prostate cancer who have biochemical recurrence after curative therapy are at higher risk for distant metastasis and cancer specific death. Assessment of aberrant DNA methylation in urine might complement currently used clinical prognostic factors and serve as a noninvasive tool for early prediction of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Materials and methods: Promoter methylation of 7 genes was evaluated by methylation sensitive polymerase chain reaction in 149 prostate cancer tissues, 37 noncancerous prostate tissues and 17 benign prostatic hyperplasia samples. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used for DNA methylation analysis of the urine of 253 patients with prostate cancer and 32 with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Results: In prostate cancer tissue the most frequently methylated genes were RASSF1, GSTP1 and RARB, which combined were positively identified in 85% of cases. These genes were also methylated in the urine of 60% of patients with prostate cancer. RASSF1 was methylated in 45% of prostate cancer urine samples with methylation intensity significantly higher in prostate cancer than in benign prostatic hyperplasia cases (p = 0.018). In a univariate model RASSF1 methylation and the total number of methylated genes in prostate cancer tissue were predictive of time to biochemical recurrence (p = 0.019 and 0.043, respectively). On multivariate analysis RASSF1 methylation together with pathological stage was the most significant predictor of biochemical recurrence in patients with Gleason score 6 tumors when analyzed in tissue and urine (p ≤0.001). Conclusions: Hypermethylation of RASSF1 in cancerous tissue and urine from patients with prostate cancer correlated with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. The prognostic potential of this biomarker deserves further investigation.",prostate cancer

"Prostate cancer management has traditionally relied upon risk stratification of patients based on Gleason score, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen and clinical tumor stage. However, these factors alone do not adequately reflect the inherent complexity and heterogeneity of prostate cancer. Accurate and individualized risk stratification at the time of diagnosis is instrumental to facilitate clinical decision-making and treatment selection tailored to each patient. The incorporation of tissue and genetic biomarkers into current prostate cancer prediction models may optimize decision-making and improve patient outcomes. In this review we discuss the clinical significance of unfavorable morphologic features such as cribriform architecture and intraductal carcinoma of the prostate, tissue biomarkers and genomic tests and assess their potential use in prostate cancer risk assessment and treatment selection.",prostate cancer
"Promoter hypermethylation is associated with the loss of expression of tumor-suppressor genes in cancer. Currently, several genome-wide technologies are available and have been utilized to examine the extent of DNA methylation in discovery-based studies involving several physiological and disease states. Although early in the process, aberrant DNA methylation is gaining strength in the fields of cancer risk assessment, diagnosis and therapy monitoring in different cancer types. There is a need to improve existing methods for early diagnosis of prostate cancer and to identify men at risk for developing aggressive disease. Because of the ubiquity of DNA methylation changes and the ability to detect methylated DNA in several body fluids (e.g., blood and urine), this specifically altered DNA may serve, on one hand, as a possible new screening marker for prostate cancer and, on the other hand, as a tool for therapy monitoring in patients having had neoplastic disease of the prostate. Since many prostate cancer patients present with advanced disease and some present with nonspecific elevation of prostate-specific antigen without prostate cancer, early detection with high specificity and sensitivity is considered to be one of the most important approaches to reduce mortality and unwanted tension of the men with high prostate-specific antigen. Therefore, an effective screening test would have substantial clinical benefits. Furthermore, methylation markers of risk of progression of disease in patients having prostate cancer permits immediate commencement of specific treatment regimens and probably longer survival and better quality of life. This review illustrates the current benefits and limitations of potentially useful prostate cancer methylation markers that have considerable existing data and touches upon other future markers as well as the field of methylation in prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Purpose: We determined the long-term clinical significance of primary Gleason pattern in patients with Gleason score 7 prostate cancer. Materials and methods: We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection and radical retropubic prostatectomy for Gleason score 7 prostate cancer at our institution. All patients who underwent adjuvant hormonal or radiation therapy were excluded from analysis. Patients were monitored for biochemical failure, that is PSA progression, systemic recurrence and cancer specific survival. Results: We identified 1,688 patients who met admission criteria, of whom 1,256 (74.4%) had primary Gleason pattern 3 and 432 (25.6%) had primary Gleason pattern 4. Median followup was 6.9 years. At 10 years primary Gleason pattern 3 was associated with increased biochemical recurrence-free survival (48% vs 38%, p <0.001), lower systemic recurrence (8% vs 15%, p <0.001) and higher cancer specific survival (97% vs 93%, p = 0.013) for Gleason primary grades 3 and 4, respectively. All of these end points remained significant on multivariate analysis when controlling for preoperative PSA, seminal vesicle involvement, margin status, DNA ploidy and TNM staging. PSA doubling time was shorter in patients with primary Gleason pattern 4 (1.64 vs 1.01 years). Systemic recurrence and cancer specific survival were associated with a PSA doubling time of less than 1 year. Conclusions: Gleason score 7 prostate cancer is a heterogeneous entity. We should continue to stratify patients according to primary Gleason pattern. Patients with Gleason score 4 + 3 prostate cancer have more aggressive disease and experience higher rates of biochemical failure, systemic recurrence and cancer specific death.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in men worldwide. Management of the disease has remained a great challenge and even more so is the aggressive advanced stage with castration-resistant behavior. The mechanisms and timing of development of castration-resistant prostate cancer are unclear and remain debatable. Progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer is undoubtedly multifactorial, with a number of molecular-genetic aberrations implicated. However, a key question that remains unanswered is: when in the evolution of prostate cancer do the changes that confer castration resistance occur? Earlier attempts to address this question led to two proposed models: the ""adaptation"" and the ""clonal selection"" models. Although the prevailing hypothesis is the adaptation model, there is recent evidence in favor of the clonal selection model. Clarification of the model development of castration-resistant prostate cancer might significantly alter our diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and potentially lead to improved outcome of management of this daunting condition. Here we review existing knowledge and current research findings addressing the timing of events in the course of prostate cancer progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Current advances in diagnostic modalities and screening has lead to diagnosis of prostate cancer at an earlier stage (the so-called ""stage shift"" phenomenon), making primary treatments of localized disease of extreme importance in management. Therapeutic modalities include conservative management, radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, and newer techniques such as cryoablation surgery and brachytherapy. This review will focus on the non-radiation, non-hormonal primary treatment of localized prostate cancer and discuss the popularity and success of ""watchful waiting,"" radical surgery, and cryoablation along with their advantages and disadvantages. These treatments will be compared to the qualities of an ideal treatment, which include cost effectiveness, efficacy, convenience of administration, tolerance by patients, low morbidity and mortality, and minimal impact on quality of life.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men. Although the use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for prostate cancer screening since the 1990s has led to increased early diagnoses, the most recent studies are in conflict about the risks and benefits of routine prostate cancer screening. Recently, evidence has emerged to support the use of the PSA test to lower mortality, but there is still concern that over-diagnosis may lead to over-treatment of cancers that would not significantly affect patients' health for several years.

"Quality of life (QoL) is not included among the end points in many studies, and QoL results are underreported in many phase 3 oncology trials. We performed a systematic review to describe QoL prevalence and heterogeneity in QoL reporting in recently published prostate cancer phase 3 trials. A PubMed search was performed to identify primary publications of randomized phase 3 trials testing anticancer drugs in prostate cancer, issued between 2012 and 2018. We analyzed QoL inclusion among end points, presence of QoL results, and methodology of QoL analysis. Seventy-two publications were identified (15 early-stage, 20 advanced hormone-sensitive, and 37 castration-resistant prostate cancer [CRPC]). QoL was not listed among study end points in 23 studies (31.9%) (40.0% early stage, 40.0% advanced hormone sensitive, and 24.3% CRPC). QoL results were absent in 15 (30.6%) of 49 primary publications of trials that included QoL among end points. Overall, as a result of absent end point or unpublished results, QoL data were lacking in 38 (52.8%) primary publications (53.3% early stage, 55.0% in advanced hormone sensitive, and 51.4% in CRPC). The most commonly used QoL tools were Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) (21, 53.8%) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) (14, 35.9%); most common methods of analysis were mean changes or mean scores (28, 71.8%), time to deterioration (14, 35.9%), and proportion of patients with response (10, 25.6%). In conclusion, QoL data are lacking in a not negligible proportion of recently published phase 3 trials in prostate cancer, although the presence of QoL results is better in positive trials, especially in CRPC. The methodology of QoL analysis is heterogeneous for type of instruments, analysis, and presentation of results.",prostate cancer
"Background: Castration-resistant prostate cancer is a disease with limited treatment options. However, the ongoing elucidation of the mechanisms underlying this disease continues to support the development of not only novel agents, but also innovative approaches. Among these therapies, immunotherapy has emerged as a promising strategy. Design: This review article summarizes the most recent data from investigations of immunotherapies in castration-resistant prostate cancer (literature and congress searches current as of August 2011). Results: Immunotherapeutic strategies such as passive immunization, vaccines, and particularly checkpoint blockade have demonstrated some efficacy as single agents. Elucidation of effective combinations of agents and drug regimens is ongoing but will require continued careful investigation, including the standardization of surrogate endpoints in clinical trials. Conclusions: It is hypothesized that the combination of immunotherapeutic agents with traditional and novel chemotherapeutics will potentiate the efficacy of the chemotherapeutics while maintaining manageable toxicity.",prostate cancer

"The management of advanced prostate cancer today follows a multidisciplinary approach and involves multi-target treatments. The paradigm has shifted from traditional hormonal therapy, surgery and radiation, to the use of chemotherapy, and until recently the development of various immunotherapies and radiopharmaceuticals. Recent advances turn to molecular medicine combining the expertise of molecular pathology and genetics. In this review, germline genetics, advances in castrate-sensitive metastatic disease, androgen receptor alterations, potential new targeted therapy and novel radiopharmaceuticals will be discussed as the newest perspectives for treating prostate cancer. With better staging and new imaging techniques, patients who could be cured by localized treatments and who could benefit from more intensive regimens can be identified. In future, careful patient selection and novel combinations are likely to be required in the management of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Intratumoral hypoxia is prevalent in many solid tumors and is a marker of poor clinical prognosis in prostate cancer. The presence of hypoxia is associated with increased chromosomal instability, gene amplification, downregulation of DNA damage repair pathways, and altered sensitivity to agents that damage DNA. These genomic changes could also lead to oncogene activation or tumor suppressor gene inactivation during prostate cancer progression. We review here the concept of repair-deficient hypoxic tumor cells that can adapt to low oxygen levels and acquire an aggressive ""unstable mutator"" phenotype. We speculate that hypoxia-induced genomic instability may also be a consequence of aberrant mitotic function in hypoxic cells, which leads to increased chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. Because both hypoxia and aneuploidy are prognostic factors in prostate cancer, a greater understanding of these biological states in prostate cancer may lead to novel prognostic and predictive tests and drive new therapeutic strategies in the context of personalized cancer medicine.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men, affecting one in 11 men in the United States. Early detection in the preclinical stage offers the best chance of increased survival, decreased morbidity and possible cure. Prostate-specific-antigen assay is rapidly joining the digital rectal exam as the standard early detection test for prostate cancer because digital rectal exam alone is no longer considered adequate. The American Cancer Society now recommends an annual serum prostate-specific-antigen test for every man age 50 or older, and current evidence strongly suggests that combining the serum prostate-specific-antigen test with the digital rectal exam increases the early detection rate for prostate cancer. This article describes prostate-cancer screening guidelines, serum prostate-specific-antigen test interpretation and an algorithm for abnormal serum prostate-specific-antigen test follow-up.",prostate cancer
"Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is the most widely known screening test to detect prostate cancer (PCa). However, PSA testing has been recently put under the microscope mainly due to its weak correlation with prostate malignancy. In several clinical trials the PSA-screening validity for the diagnosis of PCa was evaluated. PSA lacks the ability to define the progression potential of the disease usually resulting in overdiagnosis and overtreatment of patients. Therefore, the development of new ""multivariate"" prediction models for PCa that would combine the PSA screening marker (and probably PSA metrics) with better biomarkers and imaging techniques has become an evolving field. New screening tests and/or methods with increased specificity could reduce the number of men undergoing prostate biopsy - thus alleviating patients from the anxiety and the distress experienced by an unnecessary (negative) biopsy- and minimizes the healthcare cost.

"The development of biomarkers for prostate cancer screening, detection and prognosis has greatly decreased the mortality of this disease. Recently, some new views on such biomarkers as PSMA, CK34betaE12, p63, AMACR, Pca-24, hTERT, DD3, Annexin A3 and GSTP1 methylation in prostate cancer tissue have been re-identified and investigated. Future research should focus on the combined screening of multiple biomarkers and discovery of new ones, which may possibly improve the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the early detection of prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"The realization that prostate cancer is an immunogenic tumor, in conjunction with the discovery of novel methods for priming the immune system to generate an antitumor response, has resulted in several new approaches for prostate cancer immunotherapy. Based on these various approaches, several human clinical trials have begun using immune-based therapies for prostate cancer. These approaches can be divided into cytokine-based therapies, tumor-associated antigen-based therapies, tumor vaccines, and dendritic cell-based therapies. This review summarizes the latest findings from each of these approaches and gives results from the few completed human clinical trials.",prostate cancer
"Background: Acanthosis nigricans is characterized by hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratosis of the skin or mucous membranes. Its malignant form is associated with internal neoplasms, especially gastric adenocarcinoma (55-61%). Coexistence with prostate cancer is uncommon. In the paraneoplastic type of this dermatosis, the skin and mucous lesions are characteristically of more sudden onset and more severe than those in the benign form. The efficacy of various treatment strategies remains disappointing. Case presentation: We here report a case of 66-year-old Caucasian patient with metastatic prostate cancer and a mild form of acanthosis nigricans that preceded the diagnosis of malignancy and resolved with chemotherapy in parallel with the prostate cancer. The dermatosis recurred when the prostate cancer progressed. Conclusion: Concurrent acanthosis nigricans and prostate cancer is rare, and few such cases have been reported. Anti-tumor therapy occasionally results in regression of this dermatosis. Underlying malignant disease should be suspected in individuals with elderly-onset of acanthosis nigricans.",prostate cancer
"Due to their increased life expectancy, a growing number of neurological patients, particularly spinal cord injury patients, develop prostate cancer. Although prostate cancer appears to be slightly less frequent in spinal cord injury patients than in the general population (level of proof 3b), especially in the case of high and severe spinal cord injury (level of proof 3b), there is evidence to suggest that prostate cancer is responsible for morbidity (level of proof 4) and excess mortality (level of proof 5) in neurological patients with a life expectancy greater than 10 or 15 years. According to urology society guidelines, prostate cancer screening should be proposed to neurological patients with a life expectancy greater than 10 or 15 years (level of proof 5), particularly paraplegics aged 50 to 60 or 65 years. As in the general population, this screening could be based on digital rectal examination and annual PSA assay, which can still be interpreted, even in patients performing intermittent catheterization (level of proof 3b). However; PSA cannot be used in patients with an indwelling catheter (level of proof 3b). The histological diagnosis is based on prostatic biopsies, which should probably be preceded by systematic urine culture with appropriate antibiotic therapy, if necessary, to limit the risk of infection (level of proof 5). The treatment of localized prostate cancer in neurological patients, as in the general population, is based on radical prostatectomy and external beam radiotherapy. The indication must be adapted to each patient, taking into account the voiding mode and urodynamic assessment of lower urinary tract function. Brachytherapy does not appear to be an appropriate treatment modality because of its adverse effects (level of proof 5).",prostate cancer
"An expanding and increasingly older population, a rising incidence of prostate cancer, and uncertainties regarding treatment effectiveness have made this disease a target of special concern. The natural history of the cancer must be a consequence of host-tumor interactions, but little is known for sure about this subject. The growth rate of the tumor is determined by many factors, including genetic instability. At present, tumor grade, volume, and ploidy are the most useful techniques for judging the growth rate and metastatic potential. Stage A1 tumors generally are indolent, whereas stage A2 tumors are more aggressive. The natural history of stage B lesions is not well documented. The author asks two questions (Is cure necessary in those in whom it may be possible? Is cure possible in those in whom it may be necessary?) and reviews the problems inherent in screening for prostate cancer at this time.",prostate cancer
"Purpose of review: Exercise is a provocative medicine, known for its preventive, complimentary and rehabilitative role in the management of cancer. Impressively, exercise is also emerging as a synergistic and targeted medicine to enhance symptom control, modulate tumour biology and delay disease progression, with the potential to increase overall survival. Given the complex clinical presentation of advanced prostate cancer patients and their omnipresent comorbidities, this review describes the current and potential role of exercise medicine in advanced prostate cancer. Recent findings: Exercise has been shown to be safe, feasible and effective for advanced prostate cancer patients, inclusive of patients with bone metastases; a previously excluded population due to patient and clinician fear of adverse events. Preclinical data provide insight into the ability of exercise to modulate cancer-specific outcomes, may synergistically increase the potency of chemotherapy and radiotherapy and may endogenously and/or mechanically suppress tumour formation, growth and invasion in visceral and skeletal tissue. Epidemiological studies have also shown an association between physical activity and increased survival. Summary: Exercise oncology is rapidly evolving, with impressive possibilities that may directly improve patient outcomes in advanced prostate cancer. Research must focus on translating preclinical trials into human clinical trials and investigate the direct effect of exercise on overall survival.",prostate cancer
"While digital rectal examination, prostate-specific antigen, and transrectal ultrasound have been identified as effective means of early detection of prostate cancer, African American men tend to underuse these services as compared to white men. Using a nonrandom sample of 108 African American men, the authors conducted an exploratory investigation of the effects of education, income, age, and health insurance coverage on actual and perceived knowledge of prostate cancer. The extent to which the use of prostate cancer screening services may be attributed to actual and perceived knowledge of prostate cancer was also explored. Respondents demonstrated a poor knowledge of prostate cancer and less than 40% reported having had prostate cancer screening as part of their annual physical examination. The results of the study also revealed that (a) there was a moderately strong correlation between actual and perceived knowledge of prostate cancer, (b) use of prostate cancer screening service was positively associated with actual and perceived knowledge of the disease, (c) actual knowledge of prostate cancer was negatively correlated with education, age, and income, and (d) actual and perceived knowledge of prostate cancer were both correlated with having health insurance coverage.",prostate cancer
"The incidence of prostate cancer has increased constantly over the last years. Treatment, whatever the stage of disease, remains controversial. Poor prognosis in patients with a localized tumor and lymph node metastases usually excludes curative therapy. Simple resection could be a reasonable option in cases with well or moderately well differentiated localized cancer, especially if life expectancy is less than 10 years. The real problem is to identity potentially aggressive cancers since an improvement in quality of life is an important element in caring for patients with cancer of the prostate. Survival rate at 15 years in patients with localized tumors after total prostatectomy appears to be comparable with that in the general population of the same age without cancer of the prostate. Conformational radiotherapy could allow more extensive irradiation of the prostate gland without touching the neighboring organs (rectum, bladder, head of the femoral bone). The dose should reach 80 Gy. Hormone treatment is currently used as first intention treatment in patients with metastase prostate cancer. Response rate is approximately 80%. Within 2 years, 8 out of 10 patients develop hormone resistance. Complete androgen suppression could improve survival times and quality of life in approximately 15% of the patients, although it is not possible at the present time to identify prior to treatment those patients who are susceptible responders. Chemotherapy has not been shown to be particularly effective in hormone-resistant cancer of the prostate. Prevention of cancer of the prostate is the next step to be accomplished.",prostate cancer
"Background: Reports suggest worse health-related outcomes among black (vs white) men diagnosed with prostate cancer, but appropriate cause-effect inferences are complicated by the relationship of race and other prognostic factors. Methods: We searched the literature to find contemporary articles focusing on mortality among black and white men with prostate cancer in equal-access healthcare systems. We also directly assessed the association of race and prostate cancer mortality by conducting an observational cohort analysis of 1270 veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer and followed for 11 to 16 years at 9 medical centers within the Veterans Health Administration. Results: Among 5 reports providing quantitative results for the association of race and mortality among men with prostate cancer in equal-access systems, outcomes were similar for black and white men. Race also was not a prognostic factor in the observational cohort analysis of US veterans, with an adjusted hazard ratio for black (vs white) men and prostate cancer mortality of 0.90 (95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.40; P = .65). Conclusions: Mortality among black and white patients with prostate cancer is similar in equal-access healthcare systems. Studies that find racial differences in mortality (including cause-specific mortality) among men with prostate cancer may not account fully for socioeconomic and clinical factors.",prostate cancer
"The purpose of this integrative review was to explore the impact of prostate cancer (PCa) on the quality of life (QoL) and factors that contribute to the QoL for Black men with PCa. Prostate is recognized as the prevalent cancer among men in the United States. Compared to other men, Black men are diagnosed more frequently and with more advanced stages of PCa. Black men also experience disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality rates of PCa, among all racial and ethnic groups. The initial diagnosis of PCa is often associated with a barrage of concerns for one's well-being including one's QoL. As a result, men must contend with various psychosocial and physiological symptoms of PCa survivorship. Whittemore and Knafl's integrative review method was utilized to examine empirical articles from the electronic databases of the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, PubMed, Project Muse, and Google Scholar. The time frame for the literature was January 2005 to December 2016. A synthesis of the literature yielded 18 studies that met the inclusion criteria for the integrative review. A conceptual framework that examined QoL among cancer survivors identified four domains that measured the QoL among Black PCa survivors: (a) physical; (b) psychological; (c) social; and (d) spiritual well-being. Social well-being was the dominant factor among the studies in the review, followed by physical, psychological, and spiritual. Results indicate the need for additional studies that examine the factors impacting the QoL among Black PCa survivors, using a theoretical framework so as to develop culturally appropriate interventions for Black PCa survivors.",prostate cancer
"Androgens are important determinants of normal and malignant prostate growth. They function by binding to the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the androgen receptor (AR). All clinically approved AR-targeting antiandrogens for prostate cancer therapy function by competing with endogenous androgens. Despite initial robust responses to androgen deprivation therapy, nearly all patients with advanced prostate cancer relapse with lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Progression to CRPC is associated with ongoing AR signaling, which in part, is due to the expression of constitutively active AR splice variants that contain the N-terminus of the receptor but lack the C-terminus. Currently, there are no approved therapies specifically targeting the AR N-terminus. Current pharmacologic targeting strategies for inhibiting the AR N-terminal region have proven difficult, due to its intrinsically unstructured nature and lack of enzymatic activity. An alternative approach is to target key molecules such as the cochaperone BAG1L that bind to and enhance the activity of the AR AF1. Here, we review recent literature that suggest Bag-1L is a promising target for AR-positive prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most commonly occurring malignant tumor in Europe and America. Normal and neoplastic growth of prostate gland are dependent on androgen receptor (AR) expression and function. PCa is driven by androgen and its receptor, and they continue to be the key drivers of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC is the terminal stage of PCa and seriously jeopardizes the patient's quality of life and lifespan. miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs, 18-25 nt in length that destabilize mRNA or repress protein synthesis by interacting with the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of target mRNAs. miRNAs can regulate AR or be regulated by AR and then affect various signaling pathways related to cellular functions and tumor processes. In this review, we focus on the relationship between miRNAs and AR in PCa and elucidate their roles in the induction of malignant changes in PCa.",prostate cancer
"Enabling the transduction of therapeutic gene expression exclusively in diseased sites is the key to developing more effective treatments for advanced prostate cancer using viral-based therapy. While prostate cancers that express high levels of HER-2 are resistant to the killing effects of trastuzumab, they can be targeted for selective gene expression and destruction by lentiviruses with envelope proteins engineered to bind to this therapeutic antibody. More importantly, after intravenous injection, this trastuzumab-bound lentivirus is able to target castration-resistant prostate tumor xenografts, albeit with low efficiency. This proof of principle opens up multiple possibilities for the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer using a viral-based therapy. However, to be safe and more effective, the viral vectors must target prostate cancer cells more selectively and efficiently. A higher degree of specificity and efficiency of cancer cell targeting can be achieved by engineering viral vectors to bind to a specific cell surface marker and by controlling the expression of the therapeutic payload at transcriptional level, with a tissue-specific promoter, and at the translational level, with a regulatory sequences inserted into either the 5'UTR or 3'UTR regions of the therapeutic gene(s). The latter would be designed to ensure that translation of this mRNA occurs exclusively in malignant cells. Furthermore, in order to obtain a potent anti-tumor effect, viral vectors would be engineered to express pro-apoptotic genes, intra-cellar antibodies/nucleotide aptamers to block critical proteins, or siRNAs to knockdown essential cellular mRNAs. Alternatively, controlled expression of an essential viral gene would restore replication competence to the virus and enable selective oncolysis of tumor cells. Successful delivery of such bioengineered viruses may provide a more effective way to treat advanced prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer has a varied natural history. Men with similar serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, clinical stages, and histologic features in their tissue specimens can have markedly different outcomes. While prostate cancer is lethal in some patients, most men die with cancer rather than because of it. Moreover, histologically apparent cancer can be found in the prostate glands of approximately 42% of men over 50 years of age who die from other causes, but the lifetime risk that a man in the US will be diagnosed with prostate cancer is estimated to be 11% and the risk of dying from the disease is only 3.1%. Consequently, appropriate disease management requires risk assessment. How likely is it that a given man's cancer will progress or metastasize over his remaining lifetime? What is the probability of successful treatment? What are the risks of adverse effects and complications of each treatment? Physicians use a variety of clinical and pathologic parameters to assess the risk that a given cancer poses to an individual patient. In addition to the accepted parameters of serum PSA level, clinical staging, and pathologic grading and staging, PSA doubling time has emerged as an important factor in the evaluation of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer or prostate cancer that recurs after treatment. PSA doubling time can also be used as a surrogate marker for prostate cancer-specific death. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the role of PSA doubling time as a prognostic marker in men with prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) provides a noninvasive method of evaluating metabolic markers of prostate cancer or healthy prostatic tissue (the metabolites choline and citrate), and is performed in conjunction with high-resolution MR anatomic imaging. Multiple studies have showed the incremental role of MRSI combined with the anatomical information provided by MRI for assessment of cancer location and extent within the prostate, staging, and cancer aggressiveness. In addition, MRSI has a potential role for pre- and post-treatment evaluation in non surgical patients. Ongoing technical developments show the potential role of MRSI for guidance of biopsies or focal treatment. Further developments - including new 3T technology - will likely provide improved spectral resolution for better prostate cancer detection and characterization.",prostate cancer
"Objective: To study clinical prostate cancer in this locality with particular interest in incidence, clinical presentation and treatment. Design: A descriptive prospective study. Setting: Kenyatta National Referral and Teaching Hospital affiliated to College of Health Sciences of the University of Nairobi between November 1998 and October 1999. Patients: Sixty five patients with clinical prostate cancer were included in the study. Results: Age was reliably confirmed in 64 out of the 65 patients. 87.5% of the patients were aged over 61 years with a peak incidence in the 66-70 year age group and a mean age of 67 years. Crude hospital incidence of 76.5 patients per 100,000 patients and a crude hospital death rate of 5.8 patients per 100,000 patients is reported. The majority of patients (87.5%) presented late with advanced disease stages III(C) and IV(D) prostate cancer. Conclusion: The crude hospital incidence of cancer of the prostate is on the increase in this locality with a finding of 76.5 per hundred thousand patients, higher than that reported by earlier researchers in this locality and elsewhere. This study suggests that prostate cancer incidence and the magnitude of risk in our locality must have been grossly underestimated in the past. The prostate cancer rate in Kenyans may be as great as noted in black men in the United States, Jamaica, Nigeria and Cameroon which may suggest some common enhancing genetic predisposition. There is need to further investigate this phenomenon. Cancer of the prostate in this locality presents late with clinically advanced disease.",prostate cancer
"Recent transcriptome studies using next-generation sequencing have detected aberrant changes in the expression of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) associated with cancer. For prostate cancer, the expression levels of ncRNAs including microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs are strongly associated with diagnosis, carcinogenesis and tumor growth. Moreover, androgen and its cognate receptor, androgen receptor (AR), regulate various signaling pathways for prostate tumor growth. In addition, progression to lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is also owing to AR function. Systematic analysis of AR-binding sites and their regulated transcripts revealed that many ncRNAs are widely regulated at the transcriptional level. Thus, recent studies provide new insight into the complicated molecular mechanism of prostate cancer progression. This review focused on the role of various ncRNAs in prostate cancer and the association between their expression and CRPC.",prostate cancer
"The incidence of prostate cancer is increasing, particularly in western countries, but, despite this, its aetiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. Epidemiological studies have suggested a range of possible aetiological factors (e.g. high saturated fat intake, low intake of carotenoids, vasectomy and other sexual factors, high serum androgen levels, and a family history of prostate cancer), although results have been contradictory in many cases. A review of the literature suggests that there may be differences in the importance of these factors in younger (< 60 years) and older patients. In particular, there is growing evidence for the existence of an hereditary form of prostate cancer, with an early age of onset, an independence for dietary and other environmental factors, and an aggressive natural history. There is also increasing evidence to suggest that the pathogenesis of the disease in Japan, with its markedly different incidence rates for clinical disease (as opposed to 'latent' or 'histological' disease), may be different to that in North America. The evidence for a 'two-disease' theory of prostate carcinogenesis is discussed.",prostate cancer
"The treatment of prostate cancer presents the patient and clinician with several options. The choice of modality is often the most difficult. For low- and intermediate-risk disease, the choice is often between surgery and brachytherapy because the other major option, external-beam radiotherapy, has toxicity that generally only makes sense in the risk/benefit analysis for high-risk prostate cancer. The comparison of brachytherapy and surgery may be done on several levels. This review will focus the comparison on toxicity, the ""soft"" endpoints of biochemical relapse-free survival and clinical relapse-free survival, and the ""hard"" endpoint of prostate cancer-specific mortality.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer carries an extraordinarily varied prognosis. Previously, most men presented with clinical symptoms often succumbed to their disease several years following treatment with hormonal manipulation. With the advent of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, most men are now diagnosed with localized, well- to moderately differentiated disease. The most powerful predictor of long-term outcome is the Gleason score, followed by tumor volume. Over the past two decades, changes in the interpretation of Gleason patterns have resulted in the reclassification of many well-differentiated tumors as higher grade tumors. Men with well-differentiated disease have an excellent prognosis and often survive 10-20 years without intervention. Conversely, men with poorly differentiated disease often succumb to their cancer within a decade. PSA can estimate tumor volume, but poorly differentiated disease may not produce much PSA. We are unable to predict accurately the risk posed by a specific prostate cancer.",prostate cancer
"We investigate the possible reasons for the co-occurrence of bladder and prostate cancer and discuss its clinical relevance. The co-occurrence of bladder and prostate cancer can (partly) be explained by a survival effect and diagnostic bias. Radiotherapy for prostate cancer might be responsible for a significant increase in secondary bladder cancers, with an absolute effect that is small. Existing international consortia should expand to include secondary primary cancers as well as the index tumor. This will facilitate the investigation of common etiology and will help to identify subgroups that are susceptible to treatment-induced carcinogenesis. The prognosis after a diagnosis of both bladder and prostate cancer seems to depend mainly on the prognosis of the bladder tumor.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer represents one of the most prevalent malignancies in the world. Although subsets of prostate cancer are aggressive and can metastasize, it is also evident that most patients harbor indolent disease. Although current risk-stratification approaches use both clinical and pathologic factors, it is clear that biomarkers can be used to improve on these approaches. In this article, we review the currently published literature on prostate cancer molecular biomarkers, primarily in the context of radiation therapy, focusing on those found in serum, plasma, urine, and within the tumor biopsy itself. We highlight the potential use and limitations of these biomarkers and present possible future directions for biomarker investigation.",prostate cancer
"Public awareness of prostate cancer is increasing. Growing numbers of middle-aged men are seeking screening tests for prostate cancer and advice about its surgical treatment. Contrary to the hopes of many, the benefit of early diagnosis and by radical prostatectomy remains in doubt. Recent analyses suggest that 'watchful waiting', with no immediate treatment, may be an equally effective option. If this is true, why screen? Why operate? These questions should be a cause of concern to more than 1 million British men who are unaware that they have prostate cancer and to the providers of health care who have failed to address this dilemma. A national audit and randomised clinical trial are indicated.",prostate cancer
"Accurate identification of prostate cancer in frozen sections at the time of surgery can be challenging, limiting the surgeon's ability to best determine resection margins during prostatectomy. We performed desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) on 54 banked human cancerous and normal prostate tissue specimens to investigate the spatial distribution of a wide variety of small metabolites, carbohydrates, and lipids. In contrast to several previous studies, our method included Krebs cycle intermediates (m/z <200), which we found to be highly informative in distinguishing cancer from benign tissue. Malignant prostate cells showed marked metabolic derangements compared with their benign counterparts. Using the ""Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator"" (Lasso), we analyzed all metabolites from the DESI-MS data and identified parsimonious sets of metabolic profiles for distinguishing between cancer and normal tissue. In an independent set of samples, we could use these models to classify prostate cancer from benign specimens with nearly 90% accuracy per patient. Based on previous work in prostate cancer showing that glucose levels are high while citrate is low, we found that measurement of the glucose/citrate ion signal ratio accurately predicted cancer when this ratio exceeds 1.0 and normal prostate when the ratio is less than 0.5. After brief tissue preparation, the glucose/citrate ratio can be recorded on a tissue sample in 1 min or less, which is in sharp contrast to the 20 min or more required by histopathological examination of frozen tissue specimens.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer is the most prevalent tumor in the male population and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in Western countries. Besides genetic and epigenetic aberrations in protein coding genes, alterations in microRNAs equally contribute to prostate cancer initiation and progression. In this context, a plethora of overwhelming evidence establishes the involvement of microRNAs as essential actors in the multi-step cascade fostering a prostate cancer cell to leave the primary tumor and form secondary tumors at distant sites. Herein, we describe how specific microRNAs may impinge on the different stages of prostate cancer metastasis and review published profiling studies in which microRNA expression data have been analyzed in relation to clinical parameters of progression for the identification of novel biomarkers. We also provide evidence concerning the possibility to manipulate metastasis-related microRNA functions, either by mimicking or inhibiting them, as a highly promising strategy for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches for the advanced disease.",prostate cancer
"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been conventional treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer for more than 70 years. However, all patients eventually become castration-resistant and a significant proportion of life span is spent in the castration-resistant state. Prospective randomized control trials have incorporated early chemotherapy along with ADT based on the hypothesis that a significant level of resistance to ADT already exists in newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer and ADT exhibits synergistic antitumor activity with taxanes. We discuss the changing landscape of management of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer based on recently published landmark randomized trials.",prostate cancer
"We collected data on the histologic grade, stage, and age at diagnosis of 4,114 cases of prostate cancer (1,380 blacks, and 2,734 whites) in the Chicago area. The relationship between histologic grade (high = poorly or undifferentiated vs. low = well or moderately differentiated) and race (black vs. white) was examined using logistic regression. After adjusting for stage (localized, regional, and distant), the odds of high histologic grade prostate cancer in blacks compared to whites equaled 1.7 (95% CI [1.4, 2.0], P < 0.0001). These data suggest that blacks have a significantly higher burden of high histologic grade prostate cancer than whites, even after adjustment for stage at presentation. This higher burden may explain, in part, their higher mortality rate from prostate cancer given the U.S. black vs. white difference in prostate cancer mortality of a similar magnitude.",prostate cancer
"This article evaluates the use of early hormonal therapy in patients with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer. In patients receiving radiotherapy, an overall survival benefit is proven for adjuvant goserelin ('Zoladex') in locally advanced disease. Adjuvant to radical prostatectomy, castration (goserelin or orchiectomy) has demonstrated an overall survival benefit in patients with lymph node metastases. Survival advantages have not yet been proven with nonsteroidal antiandrogens, but immediate or adjuvant bicalutamide ('Casodex') improves objective progression-free survival in patients with locally advanced disease, with certain quality-of-life advantages over castration.",prostate cancer
"A major dilemma in the selection of treatment for men with prostate cancer is the difficulty in accurately characterizing the risk posed by the cancer. This uncertainty has led physicians to recommend aggressive therapy for most men diagnosed with prostate cancer and has led to concerns about the benefits of screening and the adverse consequences of excessive treatment. Genomic analyses of prostate cancer reveal distinct patterns of alterations in the genomic landscape of the disease that show promise for improved prediction of prognosis and better medical decision making. Several molecular profiles are now commercially available and are being used to inform medical decisions. This article describes the clinical tests available for distinguishing aggressive from nonaggressive prostate cancer, reviews the new genomic tests, and discusses their advantages and limitations and the evidence for their utility in various clinical settings.",prostate cancer
"Objectives: The incidence of prostate cancer is increasing, as is the number of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to manage this disease. We developed a Markov state-transition model--the Montreal Prostate Cancer Model--for improved forecasting of the health care requirements and outcomes associated with prostate cancer. We then validated the model by comparing its forecasted outcomes with published observations for various cohorts of men. Methods: We combined aggregate data on the age-specific incidence of prostate cancer, the distribution of diagnosed tumours according to patient age, clinical stage and tumour grade, initial treatment, treatment complications, and progression rates to metastatic disease and death. Five treatments were considered: prostatectomy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapies, combination therapies and watchful waiting. The resulting model was used to calculate age-, stage-, grade- and treatment-specific clinical outcomes such as expected age at prostate cancer diagnosis and death, and metastasis-free, disease-specific and overall survival. Results: We compared the model's forecasts with available cohort data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program, based on over 59,000 cases of localized prostate cancer. Among the SEER cases, the 10-year disease-specific survival rates following prostatectomy for tumour grades 1, 2 and 3 were 98%, 91% and 76% respectively, as compared with the model's estimates of 96%, 92% and 84%. We also compared the model's forecasts with the grade-specific survival among patients from the Connecticut Tumor Registry (CTR). The 10-year disease-specific survival among the CTR cases for grades 1, 2 and 3 were 91%, 76% and 54%, as compared with the model's estimates of 91%, 73% and 37%. Interpretation: The Montreal Prostate Cancer Model can be used to support health policy decision-making for the management of prostate cancer. The model can also be used to forecast clinical outcomes for individual men who have prostate cancer or are at risk of the disease.",prostate cancer
"Metastatic prostate cancer is an uncurable disease. Treatment is only palliative. Median survival of patients is 3 years. Prostate cancer is an hormonodependent cancer, androgen blockade is the most active treatment. However hormone resistance occurs after a median interval of 2 years. The major symptom is pain, others are urinary obstruction, neurological complications of bone metastases and hematological disorders. Androgen deprivation is the first-line treatment, impotency and osteoporosis being the main side effects. Other treatments are radiotherapy, radiopharmaceutics and chemotherapy. The most important treatment issue is quality of life.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer and its management have been intensely debated for years. Recommendations range from ardent support for active screening and immediate treatment to resolute avoidance of screening and active surveillance. There is a growing body of level I evidence establishing a clear survival advantage for treatment of subsets of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. This chapter presents a review of these randomized controlled trials. We argue that an understanding of this literature is relevant not only to those considering active surveillance but also to those evaluating the merits of screening. In addition, a number of important evidence-based conclusions concerning what should and should not be done can be gleaned from these trials.",prostate cancer
"Most orthopaedic surgeons are unfamiliar with proton therapy or the difference between proton radiation and photon (X-ray) radiation. After they perform a total hip replacement or metallic hip implant, their patient cannot have proton therapy for prostate cancer because the protons must pass exclusively through the hips and are blocked by metal. Proton therapy is a sophisticated and expensive technology with growing demand and limited supply. In proton therapy, heavy protons are accelerated to almost the speed of light in a synchrotron (particle accelerator) down a magnetic beam the length of a football field to radiate cancers. Proton therapy is a remarkably safe and effective treatment for prostate cancer, the most common cancer in men, although treatment superiority has yet to be proved in randomized studies. There are currently only 10 proton centers in the United States.",prostate cancer
"Ca2+ is a universal messenger regulating many physiological functions including such an important one, as the ability of the cell to undergo orderly self-destruction upon completion of its mission, called apoptosis. If this function is compromised unwanted cells may eventually take over the tissue turning it into a cancer. Ca2+ dependency of apoptosis, when its all aspects are learned and understood and key molecular players identified, may provide a good opportunity for controlling tumor growth. In the present mini-review we describe the major molecular determinants of Ca2+ homeostasis in prostate cancer cells and establish their role in the transformation to apoptosis-resistant cell phenotypes typical of advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer. We show that the hallmark of such transformation is the inhibition of apoptosis pathway associated with endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store depletion.",prostate cancer
"Recently, the incidence of prostate cancer in Japan has been markedly increased because of the aggressive use of serum PSA at urological clinics and/or screening. However, the limitations of serum PSA in diagnosis of prostate cancer are also well known. While the volume adjusted PSA, PSA isoforms and PSA kinetics are useful to improve the specificity of PSA in a diagnosis, their ability are still not enough to replace PSA. More importantly, there are no definitive markers to distinguish aggressive from indolent prostate cancers, and to predict outcomes after definitive therapies. With recent advances in biotechnology such as immunohistochemical staining, proteomics, tissue microarray, DNA microarray, FISH, ELISA, RT-PCR, and SELDI-TOF, many promising biomarkers have been identified and are currently under investigation and validation. However, it is unlikely that any one marker will predict perfectly the course of disease at present, so the use of nomograms that incorporate multiple predictive factors will be a realistic way to improve prostate cancer in screening and staging. We reviewed current and potential biomarkers for prostate cancer detection and staging.",prostate cancer
"Objective: To describe the knowledge of, and attitudes toward, out-of-pocket expenses (OOPE) associated with prostate cancer treatment and the influence of OOPE on the treatment choices of patients with prostate cancer. Materials and methods: We undertook a qualitative research study for which we recruited patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. Patients answered a series of open-ended questions during a semistructured interview and completed a questionnaire about the physician's role in discussing OOPE, the burden of OOPE, the effect of OOPE on treatment decisions, and previous knowledge of OOPE. Results: A total of 41 (26 white and 15 black) eligible patients were enrolled from the urology and radiation oncology practices of the University of Pennsylvania. Qualitative assessment revealed 5 major themes: (a) ""my insurance takes care of it""; (b) ""health is more important than cost""; (c) ""I did not look into it""; (d) ""I cannot afford it but would have chosen the same treatment""; and (e) ""It is not my doctor's business."" Most patients (38 of 41, 93%) reported that they would not have chosen a different treatment even if they had known the actual OOPE of their treatment. Patients who reported feeling burdened by OOPE were socioeconomically heterogeneous, and their treatment choices remained unaffected. Only 2 patients stated they knew ""a lot"" about the likely OOPE for different prostate cancer treatments before choosing their treatment. Conclusion: Among insured patients with prostate cancer treated at a large academic medical center, few had knowledge of OOPE before making treatment choices.",prostate cancer
"At the last congress of the American Urological Association (AUA), which took place in San Francisco from the 9th to the 12th May 2004, more than 200 abstracts on prostate cancer were presented as posters or as full communications. We present here the highlights of this congress and in particular the main subjects of news, controversies or innovations. Two major topics are particularly worthy of discussion: localized disease on the one hand and locally advanced or metastatic disease on the other. In the chapter on localized disease, we expound the most relevant data on epidemiology, screening, staging and prognosis. For the locally advanced disease we discuss quality of life, prognostic factors and recent advances in hormone therapy and chemotherapy.",prostate cancer
"Purpose/objectives: To investigate the lived experience of prostate cancer from a patient perspective. Research approach: Descriptive, qualitative. Setting: Community setting. Participants: 10 men with prostate cancer aged 62-70 years. Methodologic approach: A hermeneutic phenomenologic method using semistructured, open-ended questions addressing the lived experience. Data synthesis: Phenomenology of praxis proposed by van Manen guided the data analysis and transformed personal experiences into disciplinary understanding. Findings: The use of van Manen's method of inquiry and analysis has contributed to the findings of the study by providing a way to explore the meaning of the lived experiences in an attempt to understand living with prostate cancer. Several themes were identified: living in the unknown, yearning to understand and know, struggling with unreliability of body, bearing the diagnosis of cancer, shifting priorities in the gap, and feeling comfort in the presence of others. Conclusions: Oncology nurses can use van Manen's four fundamental existentials-lived space (spatiality), lived body (corporeality), lived time (temporality), and lived other (relationality)-to understand the lived experience of prostate cancer. Nurses have many opportunities to impact the lives of men diagnosed with prostate cancer, including diagnosis, management of physical integrity, management of psychosocial integrity, and providing education. Interpretation: Nurses may encourage men to describe their diagnosis story and illness experience to better understand the meaning of the prostate cancer experience and to provide appropriate nursing care.",prostate cancer
"Prostate cancer has heterogeneous characteristics. For that reason, even if tumors appear histologically similar to each other, there are many cases in which they are actually different, based on their gene expression levels. A single tumor may have multiple expression levels with both high-risk cancer genes and low-risk cancer genes. We can produce more useful models for stratifying prostate cancers into high-risk cancer and low-risk cancer categories by considering the range in each class through inner-class clustering. In this paper, we attempt to classify cancers into high-risk (aggressive) prostate cancer and low-risk (non-aggressive) prostate cancer using ICP (Inner-class Clustering and Prediction). Our model classified more efficiently than the models of the algorithms used for comparison. After discovering a number of genes linked to prostate cancer from the gene pairs used in our classification, we discovered that the proposed method can be used to find new unknown genes and gene pairs which distinguish between high-risk cancer and low-risk cancer.",prostate cancer
"Metastasis-directed therapy is of interest for the management of oligometastatic prostate cancer. Improved imaging may help with patient selection, but the approach to metastatic prostate cancer of ""catching 'em all"", or ""Pokemet"", must be considered experimental.",prostate cancer
"Background: Active surveillance (AS) with deferred treatment is an established management option for patients with prostate cancer and favorable clinical parameters. The impact of repeat biopsy after diagnosis was examined in a cohort of men with prostate cancer on AS. Methods: In all, 186 men with prostate cancer with favorable parameters or who refused treatment were conservatively managed by AS. Of these, 92 patients had at least 1 biopsy after diagnosis. Patients were followed every 3 to 6 months with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and physical examination and were offered rebiopsy annually or if there were any changes on physical examination or in the PSA value. Disease progression while on AS was defined as having > or =1 of the following: > or =cT2b disease, > or =3 positive cores, >50% of cancer in at least 1 core, or a predominant Gleason pattern of 4 in rebiopsies. Results: The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 67 years (range, 49-78 years). The median follow-up was 76 months (range, 20-169 months). Of the 92 patients who underwent repeat biopsies, 42 patients, 25 patients, 13 patients, 10 patients, and 2 patients had 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 rebiopsies, respectively. A total of 34 patients (36%) demonstrated disease progression on rebiopsy. The first rebiopsy was positive for cancer in 48 patients (52.2%) and negative in 44 patients (47.8%). The 5-year actuarial progression-free probability was 82% for patients with a negative first repeat biopsy compared with 50% for patients with a positive first rebiopsy (P = .02). A PSA doubling time <67 months was associated an increased risk of disease progression on biopsy. Conclusions: Negative rebiopsy in patients with prostate cancer on AS is associated with low-volume disease. The result of first repeated biopsy appears to have a strong impact on disease progression. Patients with a positive first repeated biopsy should be considered for treatment. An intensive biopsy protocol within the first 2 years is required to identify and treat those patients.",prostate cancer
"Objectives: Study of currently approved drugs and exploration of future clinical development pipeline therapeutics for cystic fibrosis, and possible limitations in their use. Methods: Extensive literature search using individual and a combination of key words related to cystic fibrosis therapeutics. Key findings: Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in CFTR gene leading to abnormality of chloride channels in mucus and sweat producing cells. Respiratory system and GIT are primarily involved but eventually multiple organs are affected leading to life threatening complications. Management requires drug therapy, extensive physiotherapy and nutritional support. Previously, the focus was on symptomatic improvement and complication prevention but recently the protein rectifiers are being studied which are claimed to correct underlying structural and functional abnormalities. Some improvement is observed by the corrector drugs. Other promising approaches are gene therapy, targeting of cellular interactomes, and newer drugs for symptomatic improvement. Conclusions: The treatment has a long way to go as most of the existing therapeutics is for older children. Other limiting factors include mutation class, genetic profile, drug interactions, adverse effects, and cost. Novel approaches like gene transfer/gene editing, disease modeling and search for alternative targets are warranted.",cystic fibrosis
"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an incurable, chronic disease, which causes severe damages to respiratory and digestive tracts. It is the most common genetically inherited disease among caucasians. This disease is caused by defects in CF genes, the so-called mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene population. At present over 100,000 people suffer from this disease worldwide. Objective: The purpose of this review study is to describe the pathophysiology of CF and provide the latest information on its diagnosis and treatment therapies with respect to the improvement of patient's quality of life and emphasis on targeted specialized care. Method: The methodological approaches include a method of literature review of available sources exploring the issue of cystic fibrosis both from a global and specific perspective point of view. A search was performed in the databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Springer and ScienceDirect. Furthermore, other sources cited in the analyzed studies were also examined. On the basis of evaluation of these literature sources, the research issue was explored. Results: The main benefits (e.g., specialized centres for the treatment of CF exist or a new breakthrough in the gene therapy of CF has been made) and limitations (e.g., comorbidity of CF, lifelong and costly treatment, or adverse impact on patient's and caregiver's quality of life) in the treatment of narcolepsy are highlighted. Conclusion: CF requires an integrated treatment approach in specialized CF centers, involving various factors contributing to a better patient's state of health in the form of relevant and well-balanced non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies. In addition, further large scale clinical trials are needed in order to develop compounds that are aimed at the most common classes of CFTR.",cystic fibrosis

"Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting, recessive disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Increased survival outcomes and the multisystem nature of the disease, including the involvement of hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal tracts, now require the need for more extensive knowledge and expertise in cystic fibrosis among gastroenterologists. Manifestations are either a direct consequence of the primary defect in cystic fibrosis or a secondary complication of the disease or therapy. Adult patients with cystic fibrosis also have an increased risk of malignancy in the gastrointestinal and pancreatico-biliary tracts compared with the general population. Novel treatments that target the basic defects in the CFTR protein have emerged, but to date not much is known about their effects on the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary systems. The introduction of such therapies has provided new opportunities for the application of intestinal endpoints in clinical trials and the understanding of underlying disease mechanisms that affect the gut in cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects ion transport in exocrine glands. Inadequate ion transport causes dehydration and the production of thick secretions in organs such as the lungs, sinuses, pancreas, intestines, hepatobiliary tree, and vas deferens. Although cystic fibrosis usually is diagnosed through a sweat chloride test, medical imaging is used to monitor pathologic changes caused by the disease. This article discusses the respiratory and nonrespiratory manifestations of cystic fibrosis and describes the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Because patients with cystic fibrosis tend to be young children, the article also covers ways to minimize radiation exposure from repeated imaging examinations.",cystic fibrosis
"Purpose of review: The increased life span of patients with cystic fibrosis has lead to the detection of new complications. Osteopenia is present in up to 50% of adult patients with cystic fibrosis, and osteoporosis in 10-34% and can cause a difficult management problem. Recent findings: In children, defects in bone health become apparent generally at adolescence because of suboptimall bone peak mass achievement. Malnutrition, inflammation, vitamin D and vitamin K deficiency, altered sex hormone production, glucocorticoid therapy, and physical inactivity potentiate poor bone health. Summary: Monitoring bone mineral density and preventive care of osteoporosis are necessary from childhood to minimize cystic fibrosis-related bone disease in adult cystic fibrosis patients.",cystic fibrosis
"Although only identified as a distinct disease in the 1930s, it was soon apparent that Cystic Fibrosis (CF) had been present, but unrecognised, in European populations for many years - perhaps even centuries [1] . Within a decade of the early descriptions, the autosomal recessive nature of this genetic disease had been clarified, and its clinical features had been expanded. Secondary nutritional deficiencies complicated the underlying condition: the first clear description of CF as ""a new disease"", which included a speculation about its genetic basis (because there were 2 pairs of sibs in the case series) was published as Vitamin A deficiency in children [2]. The diagnosis was most often made at autopsy. When it was suspected in life, the diagnostic tests used included duodenal intubation to obtain fluid which would show impaired tryptic digestion of the coating of X-Ray film in CF children, and measurement of vitamin A in the blood. Some nutritional improvement could be expected with simple, rather inefficient pancreatic enzyme preparations, but it was not until mid-century that antibiotics began to treat pulmonary infections effectively. As a young doctor in the 1950s I soon became aware that the median age at death for affected children was about one year, and most died before reaching school age. .",cystic fibrosis

"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is the end-point of a spectrum of glucose abnormalities in cystic fibrosis that begins with early insulin deficiency and ultimately results in accelerated nutritional decline and loss of lung function. Current diagnostic and management regimens are unable to entirely reverse this clinical decline. Areas covered: This review summarises the current understanding of the pathophysiology of CFRD, the issues associated with using oral glucose tolerance tests in CF and the challenges faced in making the diagnosis of CFRD. Medline database searches were conducted using search terms ""Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes"", ""Cystic Fibrosis"" AND ""glucose"", ""Cystic Fibrosis"" AND ""insulin"", ""Cystic Fibrosis"" AND ""Diabetes"". Additionally, reference lists were studied. Expert commentary: Increasing evidence points to early glucose abnormalities being clinically relevant in cystic fibrosis and as such novel diagnostic methods such as continuous glucose monitoring or 30 minute sampled oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) may play a key role in the future in the screening and diagnosis of early glucose abnormalities in CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Annual review exercise testing is recommended by the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Trust. Testing to date has focused on evaluating aerobic fitness, a key prognostic indicator. Tests available range from simple field tests, to comprehensive evaluations of aerobic exercise (dys)function - cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). 'Field tests', although easy to perform are limited in the information they provide,whereas CPET, the 'gold standard' measure of aerobic fitness, is recommended as the first-choice exercise test by the European CF Society Exercise Working Group. CPET offers a precise cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic evaluation of exercise capacity, including assessment of mechanism(s) of exercise limitation.",cystic fibrosis
"Purpose of review: The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the current understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of cystic fibrosis-liver disease (CFLD). Recent findings: CFLD has a variety of manifestations. Previously, it was thought that patients progressed from mild cholestatic disease to cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Newer evidence suggests that some patients may develop cirrhosis while others develop noncirrhotic portal hypertension. Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of disease necessitate modifications to the current diagnostic criteria. Both fibroscan and noninvasive biomarkers can be used to identify patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Ursodeoxycholic acid remains the mainstay of therapy despite a paucity of rigorous studies supporting its use. Novel therapeutic agents such as CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators and potentiators are encouraging but need to be evaluated specifically in CFLD. Summary: A better understanding of the pathophysiology of disease is critical to developing more disease-specific diagnostics and therapeutics.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-shortening recessively inherited disorder in the Caucasian population. The genetic mutation that most frequently provokes cystic fibrosis (ΔF508) appeared at least 53,000years ago. For many centuries, the disease was thought to be related to witchcraft and the ""evil eye"" and it was only in 1938 that Dorothy H. Andersen characterized this disorder and suspected its genetic origin. The present article reviews the pathological discoveries and diagnostic and therapeutic advances made in the last 75 years. The review ends with some considerations for the future.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystemic autosomal recessive disease caused by a defect in the expression of CFTR protein, i.e. chloride channel present in the apical membrane of respiratory, digestive, reproductive and sweat glands epithelium. It primarily occurs in the Caucasians, while being considerably or excep tionally rare in persons of other races. Absence, deficit or structural and functional abnormalities of CFTR protein lead to mucosal hyperconcentration in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems and malabsorption of chloride and sodium in the sweat glands. Thus, the clinical features of patients' with CF are predominated by respiratory, digestive and reproductive disorders, as well as the tendency to dehydration in the condition of increased sweating. Beside genotype variations, the degree of disease manifestation is also essentially influenced by various exogenous factors, such as the frequency and severity of respiratory infections, the level of aero-pollution, quality of immunoprophylaxis, patients' nutritional condition and other. Chloride concentration of over 60 mmol/L in sweat, a high level of immunoreactive chymotrypsinogen in blood and the verification of homozygous mutation of CFTR gene are the basic methods in the diagnostics of the disease. CF belongs to the group of severe and complex chronic diseases, and therefore requires multidisciplinary therapeutic approach. Owing to the improvement of healthcare provision, most patients with CF now survive into adulthood. In addition, their quality of life is also considerably improved.",cystic fibrosis
"Purpose of review: Almost 15 years have now passed since bacterial community profiling techniques were first used to analyse respiratory samples from people with cystic fibrosis. Since then, many different analytical approaches have been used to try to better understand the contribution of the cystic fibrosis lung microbiota to disease, with varying degrees of success. We examine the extent to which cystic fibrosis respiratory microbiome research has been successful in informing clinical decision-making, and highlight areas that we believe have the potential to yield important insight. Recent findings: Recent research on the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome can be broadly divided into efforts to better characterize microbiota composition, particularly relative to key clinical events, and attempts to understand the cystic fibrosis lung microbiology as an interactive microbial system. The latter, in particular, has led to the development of a number of models in which microbiome-mediated processes precipitate clinical events. Summary: Growing technological sophistication is enabling increasingly detailed microbiological data to be generated from cystic fibrosis respiratory samples. However, translating these data into clinically useful measures that accurately predict outcomes and guide treatments remains a formidable challenge. The development of systems biology approaches that enable the integration of complex microbiome and host-derived data provide an exciting opportunity to address this goal.",cystic fibrosis
"There are now more adult than paediatric cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and their life expectancy continues to improve. This means that CF patients will be more commonly encountered in a variety of hospital settings including fertility services, gastrointestinal (GI) clinics, diabetes clinics, surgical wards, and acute admissions. Cystic fibrosis units welcome early contact when patients are admitted to other units and it is important to have a structured approach to their assessment and management.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) research and case reports were robust in the year 2018.

"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease with pulmonary involvement being predominant and often leading to respiratory failure and premature death. Non-pulmonary complications related to CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) defect are numerous and account for significant morbidity (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, diabetes, CF-related liver disease, chronic sinusitis, osteoporosis). Improvement in patients' care led to a continuous increase in life expectancy, with a subsequent increase in the number of adult CF patients worldwide. Increased life expectancy comes with increased prevalence of CF-related comorbidities, but also with new emerging complications directly related to ageing (chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular risk factors, cancers). CFTR modulators might also contribute to modify the face of CF epidemiology and prognosis. Ageing with CF has become a challenge for CF patients and caregivers. This review summarizes classic and emerging comorbidities in the context of current growth and ageing of the CF population. It also addresses potential roles of CFTR modulators.",cystic fibrosis
"Background: Cystic fibrosis is rare in Tunisia. Its diagnosis requires experienced specialists. Its prognosis is poor in developing countries. Objectives: To study the epidemiologic, clinical, genetic features and the therapeutic challenges of cystic fibrosis in Tunisian children. Methods: Covering a period of 21 years, this retrospective study included all patients with a definite diagnosis of cystic fibrosis from the Pediatrics Department B of The Children's Hospital of Tunis. Results: Data from 32 children (14 boys and 18 girls) were collected. The diagnosis was made during the first year of life in 28 cases. Meconium ileus was found in 5 cases, respiratory manifestations in 22 cases, chronic diarrhea in 19 cases, faltering growth in 17 cases and a pseudo Barter syndrome in 2 cases. The sweat chloride test was positive in all cases. The most frequent mutation was F508del (56% of cases). Respiratory complications marked the outcome. Among our 32 patients, 15 patients (50%) died at an average age of 5 years and 3 months, mainly due to respiratory failure. The mean age of the surviving patients was 5 years. Conclusion: Cystic fibrosis prognosis is poor in our series compared to developed countries due to the longer diagnostic delay and the limited therapeutic options.",cystic fibrosis
"Studies published in the last year have expanded our knowledge of potential disease modifying agents in the treatment of class II, III and IV CFTR mutations, and included the first report of an efficacious gene therapy for CF.

"Patient registries provide useful information to afford more knowledge on rare diseases like Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Twenty-two studies originating from national CF registries, focusing on demographics, survival, genetics, nutritional status, and non-pulmonary complications, were published between December 2011 and March 2015. The purpose of this review article is to examine these reports, aiming attention to the clinical characteristics of CF patients included in the registries, current, and estimated future epidemiological data, the role of gender gap, the increasing survival in different countries.

"Aim: To describe the nature and consequences of the multi-system genetic condition cystic fibrosis with a view to ensuring optimal dental treatment planning for these patients. Methods: A literature search was conducted to identify the key medical and dental manifestations of cystic fibrosis. These findings are discussed and utilised to create recommendations for treatment planning in patients with cystic fibrosis for the practising dental practitioner. Results: Cystic fibrosis is a complex, lethal, multisystem autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations on chromosome 7 which result in dysfunction of an ion channel that sits on epithelial surfaces. Respiratory disease remains the leading cause of mortality. Survival has greatly increased in recent decades secondary to improved treatment and specialist care. Specific dental manifestations of the disease may result from the condition itself or complications of treatment. Modification of patient management may be necessary to provide optimum patient care. Conclusion: The pathophysiology and clinical manifestations are relevant to practicing dental practitioners and inform recommendations to be utilised to ensure optimal treatment planning for these patients.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis has only been recognized as a distinct clinical entity for less than 60 years. In that period of time, the median survival has improved from a few months to 29 years. This editorial review outlines the clinical multiorgan involvement of cystic fibrosis and current management strategies and introduces the comprehensive articles by the contributing authors of this section on the most rapidly evolving areas in cystic fibrosis. The discussion includes how the cystic fibrosis gene product, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, produces lung disease; the relationship between genotype and phenotype; the factors that determine prognosis in cystic fibrosis; new treatment modalities for cystic fibrosis; lung transplantation; and the prospects for gene therapy in cystic fibrosis. With rapid advances in our clinical and genetic understanding of cystic fibrosis, it is projected that individuals born with cystic fibrosis today will live into their 40s.",cystic fibrosis
"Improved life expectancy in cystic fibrosis (CF) has led to an expanding population of adults with CF, now representing almost 50 % of the total CF population. This creates new challenges from long-term complications such as diabetes mellitus (DM), a condition that is present in 40 %-50 % of adults with CF. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) results from a primary defect of insulin deficiency and although sharing features with type 1 (DM1) and type 2 diabetes (DM2), it is a clinically distinct condition. Progression to diabetes is associated with poorer CF clinical outcomes and increased mortality. CFRD is not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and the prevalence of microvascular complications is lower than DM1 or DM2. Rather, the primary goal of insulin therapy is the preservation of lung function and optimization of nutritional status. There is increasing evidence that appropriate screening and early intervention with insulin can reverse weight loss and improve pulmonary function. This approach may include targeting postprandial hyperglycemia not detected by standard diagnostic tests such as the oral glucose tolerance test. Further clinical research is required to guide when and how much to intervene in patients who are already dealing with the burden of one chronic illness.",cystic fibrosis
"Today cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are surviving longer but ultimately the lung disease will progress despite new treatments. Lung transplantation, a life saving procedure, initially was not offered to CF patients due to their infectious complications and complications related to their multisystem disease. After the first CF patients were transplanted it appeared clear that CF patients had excellent outcomes. Infectious complications with multi-resistant bacteria are still a challenge for some patients which shortens survival in some cases. Better understanding and management of their unique extra pulmonary complications including other organ transplants have opened new horizons in the life of CF patients. Increasing number of CF patients are surviving longer pre and post transplant. Without doubt we will continue to learn as they present with new challenges and conditions unique to their disease. We reviewed the evolution and current status of the main aspects of lung transplant for CF patients.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis, a rare, hereditary and chronic disease, affects the psychic functioning of children and their families.

"As the life span of patients with cystic fibrosis has increased, so has the prevalence of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus. However, screening practices for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus vary widely, which affects accurate estimates of the health burden of this comorbidity. The management of prediabetes and hyperglycemia is an increasingly important aspect of care in patients with cystic fibrosis, but few studies have specifically addressed the management of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus. Previous studies support the use of insulin for the treatment of patients with this disorder, but the evidence for its use in patients with cystic fibrosis and impaired glucose tolerance is poor. Nutritional management is currently guided by dietary recommendations for individuals with cystic fibrosis, with little evidence specific to the dietary management of patients with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus. Additionally, microvascular complications have become more frequent as a result of the rise in life expectancy of these patients, yet to date no intervention studies have addressed prevention or management of diabetic complications in patients with cystic fibrosis. A strong evidence base is needed to guide the management of patients with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus and its complications.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is known to be a serious genetic disease among those of northern European ancestry. Well known to nurses are the pulmonary insults to survival for children with cystic fibrosis. An aspect of health care not often found in the nursing literature is a focus on cystic fibrosis gastrointestinal presentation. Because of the chronic nature of cystic fibrosis, those providing health care to children must have an understanding of the disease in the growing infant and child. An overview of cystic fibrosis and the possible effect on the pancreas, gut, and liver are reviewed. Areas of developmental concern to the pediatric nurse practitioner are listed.",cystic fibrosis
"Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis have resulted in increased survival for those afflicted with this disease. As a result, more women are reaching their reproductive years and will subsequently conceive. Multiple organ systems are affected during the course of cystic fibrosis and may impact on pregnancy; however, pulmonary complications play a major role in morbidity and mortality. Therefore, this article primarily focuses on the pulmonary aspects of cystic fibrosis as they relate to pregnancy. The current literature suggests a favorable outcome for the pregnancy when there is limited pulmonary dysfunction. Chronic severely impaired pulmonary function is associated with poorer pregnancy outcome; however, it is the acute deterioration of pulmonary function that may in fact be associated with the highest morbidity and mortality for both mother and infant. Aggressive management of pulmonary infection and function is essential, and pulmonary status should be evaluated on a monthly basis. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) can be used to monitor pulmonary status. Close surveillance, aggressive management, and a team approach can and has resulted in successful pregnancy outcome in those women with cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"While the care of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has been mainly the province of pediatricians, great improvements in the therapy and life span of CF patients often results in their transition to care by adult physicians. In this review of CF, we begin with an overview of the epidemiology and genetics of the disease, with a discussion of the recently found ion abnormalities that lead to the clinical manifestations. This is followed by a discussion of the pathophysiology. Methods of diagnosis, ranging from the gold standard, the sweat test, to recent advances based on a greater understanding of the genetics of the disease are reviewed. This is followed by a discussion of therapy primarily geared to the treatment of the respiratory complications, as they are the most common lethal factors of the disease. We point out controversies where they exist. Newer forms of therapy such as lung transplantation are discussed, and we finish with a discussion about future therapeutic modalities, some of which are being approved as the paper is in print.",cystic fibrosis
"Introduction: Socioeconomic status (SES), which indicates one's access to financial, educational, and social resources, is a powerful determinant of health outcomes in multiple chronic diseases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in a single gene. Although life expectancy and quality of life for patients with CF have improved exponentially, disease severity varies substantially, even among individuals with identical genotypes. Areas covered: CF disease progression and outcomes are influenced by a number of nongenetic factors, such as material well-being, educational attainment, living and working conditions, physical environment and exposures, family environment, social support, health behaviors, and health care. This review discusses pathways by which financial, educational, and social resources are translated into health advantages in CF. Expert commentary: To achieve equitable CF outcomes, the contribution of nongenetic factors must be emphasized, highlighting the mechanisms through which the social and physical environments influence disease variability.",cystic fibrosis
"The study of cystic fibrosis (CF) provides a fascinating insight into developments in medicine in the 20th century. Milestones include the first clear clinical descriptions in the 1930s, discovery of a sweat electrolyte abnormality, establishing the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and improvements in treatment. Microdissection experiments on sweat glands allowed the main defect to be delineated as one of chloride transport. Location of the gene to chromosome 7 made prenatal diagnosis feasible and carrier detection in siblings. The CF gene--its product being the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and its major mutation Delta F508 was discovered in 1989. World-wide collaboration has resulted in discovery of more than 150 further mutations. Incorporation of CFTR into non-chloride transporting insect cells by conferring chloride transport, proved it a chloride channel. CFTR incorporated into adenovirus results in correction of the chloride transport defect in airway cells, bringing gene therapy closer.",cystic fibrosis
"Haemoptysis is a common complication in cystic fibrosis (CF), occurring in approximately 9% of the population. Massive haemoptysis is associated with older patients, more severe disease and carries a high mortality rate. Despite this there are few robust published studies of effective treatments and knowledge of the precise pathogenesis is limited. Current guidelines for treatment from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) are based on consensus opinion of experts. Patients with massive haemoptysis who do not respond to initial medical treatments should undergo bronchial artery embolization. This will control the bleeding in the majority of cases but recurrence rates are high and there are little data to support long-term improved outcomes. Surgery is a last resort in patients with CF.",cystic fibrosis

"Cystic fibrosis is a disease that still causes a reduced life expectancy. The treatment burden remains high for affected individuals with often a combination of multiple oral and inhaled medications, as well as physiotherapy, required on a daily basis.

"Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that typically produces malnutrition and chronic respiratory infections. Prolonged bronchial obstruction, infection, and inflammation result in bronchiectstasis and permanent lung damage. Most cystic fibrosis patients die because of this progressive respiratory disease. Thus, in the absence of a cure, effective respiratory therapy is the primary means to extend and improve the quality of life for the cystic fibrosis patient. Aerosol therapy, airway clearance techniques, and noninvasive ventilation can all improve quality of life and possibly extend survival. Close patient monitoring with pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, and induced sputum can result in earlier treatment, potentially reducing permanent lung damage. Earlier diagnosis has prevented serious complications through early initiation of preventive therapies such as improved nutrition.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is commonly associated with energy deficiency in children and adults. Chronic undernutrition will lead to failure to thrive, wasting, and stunting of linear growth; nutrition and survival are intimately related in cystic fibrosis. These problems can simply be considered as energy imbalance, and management centers on restoration of energy balance. Specific nutrient deficiencies, such as fat soluble vitamins, are common in cystic fibrosis. Recent work has highlighted problems with bone density and also the prevalence of vitamin K deficiency. Management of nutritional problems can be complex, and injudicious treatment can further worsen the situation, as the relationship between high daily doses of pancreatic enzymes and the development of fibrosing colonopathy illustrates.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most frequent monogenic genetic disease, autosomal recessive transmitted, characterized by an impressive clinical polymorphism and appreciative fatal prospective. Liver disease is the second non-pulmonary cause of death in cystic fibrosis, which, with increasing life expectancy, became an important management problem. Predisposing factors like male gender, pancreatic insufficiency, meconium ileus and severe mutation are incriminated to influence the occurrence of cystic fibrosis associated liver disease (CFLD). Our study included 174 patients with CF, monitored in the National Cystic Fibrosis Centre, Timisoara, Romania. They were routinely followed-up by clinical assessment, liver biochemical tests, ultrasound examinations and other methods like transient elastography, biopsy, in selected cases. Sixty-six patients, with median age at diagnosis 4.33 years, diagnosed with CFLD, without significant gender gap. CFLD was frequent in patients aged over eight years, with meconium ileus history, carriers of severe mutations (p=0.002). Pancreatic insufficiency, although present in 75% of patients with CFLD was not confirmed as risk factor, not male gender, in our study. CF children older than eight years, carriers of a severe genotype, with a positive history of meconium ileus, were more likely predisposed to CFLD.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disease with fatal outcome in Caucasians with a frequency of 1 in 2500 life births. It is caused by mutations in a single gene on the long arm of chromosome 7 encoding a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). The defect in CFTR leads to pathological changes in all organs with mucus-secretory glands, e.g. airways, pancreas, gut, biliary tract, vas deferens and sweat glands. Despite impressive advances in understanding the molecular basis of the disease, life expectancy is still limited in CF and chronic infection of the lung resulting in fibrosis and bronchiectasis followed by respiratory insufficiency is still the main factor in morbidity and the leading cause of death. Poor nutritional status is one of the major problems in the vicious cycle of chronic inflammation and lung destruction and its impact on outcome in lung function has been demonstrated. The possible role of growth hormone treatment in this context will be discussed.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) should be considered in patients with a wide variety of clinical presentations and of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. In most cases the diagnosis is suggested by manifestations of chronic sinopulmonary disease and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and then confirmed by a positive sweat test result. Patients may, however, present with pancreatic sufficiency or other atypical clinical features, sometimes in association with normal or borderline sweat test results. In such cases, the ability to detect CF mutations and to measure transepithelial bioelectric properties can be diagnostically useful. Mutation analysis can also be used for carrier screening, prenatal diagnosis, and newborn screening.",cystic fibrosis
"Mist tent therapy for cystic fibrosis went through a rise and fall in popularity between the 1950s and 1970s, providing an opportunity to explore the nature of therapeutic change in medicine. The therapy ""worked"" in the context of a particularly grim life expectancy in the early 1950s and in the setting of a comprehensive therapeutic program that began in Cleveland in 1957. Although clinical studies published in the 1970s provided evidence that mist tents were ineffective or even harmful, these later studies were not necessarily more robust than earlier studies that provided evidence of mist tent efficacy, suggesting that other factors may have also contributed to mist tent abandonment. In fact, the unpalatable nature of mist tent therapy, which was described by one doctor as akin to incarceration, and studies that questioned the theoretical underpinnings of the therapy also played important roles in the eventual abandonment of mist tents.",cystic fibrosis
"Currently there is no cure for cystic fibrosis (CF). Treatments are focused on addressing the disease symptoms, with varying degrees of success. Regenerative medicine holds the promise of regenerating dysfunctional or damaged tissues and to enhance the body's own endogenous repair mechanisms. The discovery of endogenous and exogenous stem cells has provided valuable tools for development of novel treatments for CF. The ability of stem cells to differentiate into functional pulmonary cells, modulate inflammatory responses and contribute to pulmonary function has provided researchers with multiple approaches to develop effective treatment strategies. Several approaches show promise to produce viable therapeutic treatments to treat the underlying cause of CF, reduce the symptoms and mitigate long-term damage, and generate functional replacement organs for end-stage transplantation. This review provides an overview of the rapidly progressing field of cell therapy for CF, focusing on the various cell types utilized and current strategies that show promise to improve life expectancy and quality of life for CF patients.",cystic fibrosis
"The multidisciplinary care, at different referral centers of cystic fibrosis, is aimed at monitoring and treating cystic fibrosis patients. Mortality attributed to this hereditary disease is high, since it affects the exocrine glands, involving multiple organs, and evolves in a chronic, progressive way. However, systemized care and the improved, shared understanding of gastroenterologists, nutritionists and pulmonologists, contribute to prolonged survival and abated morbimortality. The aim of this study is to describe the main aspects of clinical and nutritional intervention in cystic fibrosis patients so that monitoring by a multidisciplinary team is optimized and performed as early as possible. The review was carried out on articles indexed in the Medline, Lilacs, SciELO, Current Contents and Cochrane databases, finding 189 articles in Portuguese, English and Spanish, with emphasis on articles published between 2000 and 2011. Due to the scientific relevant contribution, some publications before 2000 were included totalized 77 related to the multidisciplinary care. The reviewed studies suggest that multidisciplinary care is essential for knowledge integration in order to impose permanent update of scientific information, thereby contributing to the development of intervention strategies that enhance survival and motivate the development of skills to cope with the complex treatment regimen that is necessary for cystic fibrosis treatment and prevention of related complications.",cystic fibrosis
"The care of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has improved over the past 30 years, and most patients now survive well into adulthood. As a result, clinicians other than pediatricians are more likely than in the past to see CF patients and manage their respiratory, gastrointestinal, pancreatic, and reproductive complications.",cystic fibrosis
"Improvements in outcomes for patients who have cystic fibrosis (CF) have been striking in the last 30 years. Median survival now approaches the fifth decade of life. Advances in the understanding of the basic defect and the pathobiology of CF have led to new treatments, some of which have undoubtedly contributed to this success. Improved understanding of the basic defect and the acquisition and maintenance of epidemiologic resources for the CF population in the United States have allowed us to determine predictors of survival and identify genetic, environmental, and therapeutic factors that may influence it. This article reviews some of the key epidemiologic and pathobiologic factors discovered thus far.",cystic fibrosis
"One third of patients with cystic fibrosis are adults. The respiratory disease, which conditions the vital prognosis, consists of bronchiectasis with chronic bronchial infection and bursts of acute infection, leading to respiratory insufficiency. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most frequent bacteria in adulthood. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is associated in 80% of patients. Some complications, such as diabetes, hepatic cirrhosis or osteoporosis, are more frequent in adults. Treatment is based on chest physiotherapy and antibiotics with intravenous courses when there is a colonisation with P. aeruginosa. Pregnancy can be considered in women when respiratory and nutritional status is acceptable. Men are sterile because of congenital bilateral atresia of vas deferens, but can be proposed medical assistance for procreation.",cystic fibrosis
"The author presents a short demonstration of details in history of cystic fibrosis. It is supposed that CF appeared about 3,000 BC. Migration of peoples, gene mutations, and new conditions in nourishment could have been the causes. Resulting from old cleaning ceremonies and preventing or treating uncanny effects in children, it was been usual to lick forehead of newborn and children crosswise. If one perceived a salty taste, the child was called bewitched or fascinated and was feared to die soon. The author detected describings in 12 states of modern Europe. Medical documents are reviewed from first case report until Carl von Rokitansky in 1838.",cystic fibrosis
"As the survival of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) improves, it becomes increasingly important to address such issues as employment, reproduction, and quality of life in adulthood. In this study, 22 patients and 20 parents completed a questionnaire about the natural history, treatment and genetics of cystic fibrosis. Patients and parents knew as much as each other about the natural history of cystic fibrosis. Patients under 13 knew significantly less about the genetics and treatment. All found probability questions about heredity difficult. All the patients indicated that they would like further information on the future and how they would cope, through CF literature, organized patient groups and, in adolescence, would prefer to obtain information from medical staff rather than parents. Patients had received considerable information about the disease and its treatment from parents and clinical staff, but few had discussed the day to day problems of living with cystic fibrosis. This study has identified specific areas of ignorance in patients with cystic fibrosis, areas that need addressing in view of the improved survival associated with this disease.",cystic fibrosis
"Purpose of review: There have been several recent articles which have attempted to refine the appropriate timing of listing for lung transplantation and the identification of factors which increase the risk with particular emphasis on pretransplant microbiology in patients with cystic fibrosis. Moreover, there are several series describing long-term outcomes and demonstrating improved long-term survival following lung transplantation for patients with cystic fibrosis. This review attempts to summarize the main points. Recent findings: Although forced expiratory volume in 1 s still plays an important role in timing for listing for lung transplantation, other factors such as arterial PaCO2, number of exacerbations, sex, weight, development of pneumothorax and microbiology of colonizing bacteria with particular relevance to Burkholderia all have been shown to influence survival in patients with advanced cystic fibrosis. The median survival should now be around 10 years, and strategies to reduce renal damage and chronic allograft dysfunction including preventing gastro-oesophageal reflux and airway infection receive greater emphasis. Summary: This article attempts to provide an overview of the current important topics for the clinician involved in cystic fibrosis lung transplantation.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetically inherited and potentially fatal disease. In the Western world, 1 in 23 people carry the defective gene. This article outlines the genetics of CF and its mode of inheritance and examines what types of carrier screening are available. The carrier frequency is calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Current treatments are evaluated, with a description and critique of gene therapy, the treatment of the future for respiratory failure.",cystic fibrosis
"Prognosis for patients with cystic fibrosis has improved dramatically over the past three decades. In the United States, median survival age is now 28.9 years. Although genotype predicts exocrine pancreatic function, it does not correlate with pulmonary status or overall clinical outcome. However, there are a number of parameters, such as exocrine pancreatic sufficiency, male gender, absence of colonization with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, presentation with predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms, balanced family functioning and coping, and compliance with treatment regimens, that predict a more favorable outcome. The impact of early diagnosis and treatment is still controversial. Although nonblinded studies indicate decreased morbidity in the first 2 to 4 years of life among patients diagnosed by newborn screening, no data support long-term benefit in terms of pulmonary function or survival. With increased longevity, there is now evidence of a small but significantly increased risk of gastrointestinal tract cancer among patients with cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis

"Over 30,000 individuals in the United States of America are living with cystic fibrosis (CF). Despite incremental advances in care and understanding of its pathophysiology, CF remains a significantly life-limiting disease. Readily accessible newborn screening, genetic testing, and an improved awareness have increased the early recognition of CF, atypical presentations of CF, and the CF-related diseases. Improvements in medical management have led to continually improving life expectancy for patients with CF. Despite improved management strategies, severe lung disease remains the commonly life-limiting pathology. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of the respiratory-tract manifestations of CF that represent the life-limiting aspects of the condition and summarize upcoming and possible future therapies for patients with CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the CFTR gene. The number of adult CF patients increased dramatically, since life expectancy is now around thirty years. CF is usually a pediatric disease. In adult patients the disease associate a diffuse bronchectasia with chronic colonisation of sputum with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pancreatic insufficiency. Mortality is usually related to respiratory insufficiency. One third of adult patients develop diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of CF can be made in adult patients particularly when it exists male infertility with congenital absence of vas deferens, chronic sinusitis or diffuse bronchectasia or chronic pancreatitis, acute and recurrent pancreatitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The diagnosis is established with positive sweat chloride concentration, or double CFTR mutations and/or other suggestive organ involvement.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited chronic disease that remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality in affected patients, mostly in the young. A wealth of knowledge has been gained into the genetics, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestation of the disease. In parallel with these new insights into the disease, novel treatments have been developed or are under development that have had a major impact on quality of life and survival. Improvement in the delivery of care to patients in CF centers, using a team-based approach, and constant review of process, and by quality improvement projects, have also had an impact on outcomes in CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disorder. Treatment is complex and evidence for treatment decisions may be absent. Characterising gaps in the research evidence will highlight treatment uncertainties and help prioritise research questions. We systematically identified the evidence gaps for treatment decisions in CF. Methods: We searched for systematic reviews and guidelines on treatment interventions in CF. Two researchers identified eligible reviews with arbitration from a third. Using a structured framework, we extracted and characterised evidence gaps. Results: There were 73 reviews and 21 guidelines that met our inclusion criteria. From these, we identified 148 evidence gaps across a range of treatment areas. We found 111 evidence gaps through systematic reviews and a further 37 from guidelines. The reason for an evidence gap could only be reliably characterised for systematic reviews. In most cases, there was more than one explanation-most commonly few or no trials (97/111 evidence gaps). Other important factors leading to evidence gaps were small sample size (49/111), inadequate duration of follow-up (38/111) or intervention (37/111) and factors relating to outcomes (35/111). Evidence gaps from both systematic reviews and guidelines fell into the following categories: Respiratory (91); Gastrointestinal (20); PhysiotherapyandExercise (16); Musculoskeletal (6); Endocrine (4); Basic defect of CF (8); Psychosocial (2); Ears, Nose and Throat (1). Conclusions: We have compiled an up-to-date list of treatment uncertainties in CF and the reasons for these uncertainties. These can be used as a resource to aid researchers and funders when planning future trials. Prospero registration number: Pre-results; CRD42015030111.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is a multisystem disease characterized primarily by chronic pulmonary infection and bronchiectasis, pancreatic exocrine impairment, and elevated sweat chloride. In the last 4 decades, new treatment strategies and aggressive nutritional management have resulted in a significant increase in expected survival, with median predicted survival in cystic fibrosis now to older than 35 years. This increase in predicted survival has also been aided by a greater appreciation of the potential variability in the presentation and severity of cystic fibrosis, resulting in identification of a growing number of mild cases. As it is estimated that within the next decade more than half of all individuals with cystic fibrosis will be aged 18 years or older, adult medicine caregivers are increasingly likely to encounter patients with cystic fibrosis and be exposed to their unique medical management.",cystic fibrosis

"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) should no longer be viewed primarily as a 'chloride channel' but recognized as a channel that also controls the efflux of other physiologically important anions, such as glutathione (GSH) and bicarbonate. More effective approaches to cystic fibrosis treatment may result from this reconceptualization of the CFTR by researchers and clinicians. For example, oxidant damage in cystic fibrosis has been assumed to be a significant part of the pathophysiology of the disease. Generally speaking, antioxidant status in cystic fibrosis is compromised. However, until recently this was seen as secondary to the excessive chemoattraction of neutrophils in this disease caused by mutation of the CFTR protein, leading to a high oxidant burden. New findings suggest that the cystic fibrosis mutations in fact cause a primary dysfunction in the system of one of the body's most important antioxidant and immune-signaling substances: the reduced GSH system. Cystic fibrosis mutations significantly decrease GSH efflux from cells without redundant channels to the CFTR; this leads to deficiency of GSH in the epithelial lining fluid of the lung, as well as in other compartments, including immune system cells and the gastrointestinal tract. This deficiency is exaggerated over time as the higher-than-normal oxidant burden of cystic fibrosis leads to successively larger decrements in GSH without the normal opportunity to fully recover physiologic levels. This GSH system dysfunction may be the trigger for initial depletion of other antioxidants and may also play a role in initiating the over-inflammation characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Proper GSH system functioning also affects immune system competence and mucus viscosity, both of relevance to cystic fibrosis pathophysiology. In a way, cystic fibrosis may be thought of as the first identified disease with GSH system dysfunction.This overview provides a review of the most pertinent recent research findings in this area. Exogenous augmentation of GSH in the lung epithelial lining fluid is possible, and therapeutic approaches include administration of aerosolized buffered GSH, intravenous GSH, and oral GSH. However, it is important to remember that the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis is multifactorial, and rectification of GSH system dysfunction in patients with cystic fibrosis will not eliminate all harmful effects of the disease. The promising results of two clinical trials of aerosolized buffered GSH in cystic fibrosis patients have been published or accepted for publication at the time of this writing. GSH depletion in lung epithelial lining fluid has also been noted in other respiratory diseases such as COPD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome, and therapies to augment GSH may also be contemplated in these diseases.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is a recessive inherited disorder that affects about 30,000 Americans. The majority of infants born with cystic fibrosis now reach adulthood, making surgical procedures performed in this patient group more common. The disease is a heterogeneous disorder caused by widespread dysfunction of exocrine glands and involving salivary, sweat, digestive, and pulmonary secretions. The broad, variable, and sometimes confusing array of clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis include obstructive pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency, abnormally high sweat electrolyte concentrations, nasal polyps, infertility, and pansinusitis. In this article, the epidemiology, genetics, and pathophysiology of the disease are outlined briefly. Preoperative assessment is reviewed, and guidelines are submitted regarding anesthetic management.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasians, with a frequency of approximately 1 in 3000 live births. The mutated gene is a defective chloride channel in epithelial cells, named cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Several different protocols for the scanning of the entire gene have aided molecular diagnosis and improved our understanding of the disorder's pathophysiology, but also showed the disease's complexity. Therefore, CF phenotype remains difficult to predict from CFTR mutation data alone: several studies have suggested that additional genes could modulate its clinical outcome. Gene replacement therapy is still far from being used in patients with CF, mostly due to the difficulties with targeting the appropriate cells. In this review, we summarize recent advances, both in the pharmacological and gene therapy field, aimed for the treatment of the disease.",cystic fibrosis
"When Watson and Crick determined the structure of DNA in 1953, a biological revolution began. One result of this revolution is the Human Genome Project. The primary goal of this international project is to obtain the complete nucleotide sequence of the human genome by the year 2005. Although molecular biologists and geneticists are most enthusiastic about the Human Genome Project, all areas of clinical medicine and fields of biology will be affected. Cystic fibrosis is the most common, inherited, lethal disease of white persons. In 1989, researchers located the cystic fibrosis gene on the long arm of chromosome 7 by a technique known as positional cloning. The most common mutation (a 3-base pair deletion) of the cystic fibrosis gene occurs in 70% of patients with cystic fibrosis. The knowledge gained from genetic research on cystic fibrosis will help researchers develop new therapies (e.g., gene) and improve standard therapies (e.g., pharmacologic) so that a patient's life span is increased and quality of life is improved. The purpose of this review is twofold. First, the article provides an overview of the Human Genome Project and its clinical significance in advancing interdisciplinary care for patients with cystic fibrosis. Second, the article includes a discussion of the genetic basis, pathophysiology, and management of cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis

"Examination of exhaled breath condensate belongs to experimental methods that are used in many pulmonary diseases and it can take part in the study of their pathophysiology. Its contribution to diagnostics and to monitoring of response to treatment is also evaluated. Many biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress were studied in exhaled breath condensate in cystic fibrosis. Examination of pH of exhaled breath condensate is considered to be useful in evaluation of inflammatory acidification of airways, together with evaluation of response to antibiotic treatment of pulmonary exacerbation, due to immediately accessible result. Other important biomarkers include 8-isoprostane and 3-nitrotyrosine as markers of oxidative stress (both with negative correlation with pulmonary function) and leukotriene B4 as marker of neutrophilic inflammation. Opposite to other pulmonary diseases, hydrogen peroxide does not belong to useful markers of oxidative stress in cystic fibrosis, due to abundant reduced thiols and glutathione peroxidase in sputum of these patients. Attempts to detect bacterial DNA in exhaled breath condensate in cystic fibrosis also failed. In spite of mentioned progress, examination of exhaled breath condensate remains a research method and it has not been introduced into clinical practice.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis occurs in 1 in 2000 to 4000 whites, and about 1 in 25 people are heterozygous carriers. The CF gene is cloned, and a single common mutation is found on 70% to 75% of CF chromosomes in most populations. Numerous different mutations are found on the remaining CF chromosomes. DNA analysis for carrier testing should be offered to relatives of CF patients and to reproductive partners of proven carriers. Population based carrier screening could detect about 72% of at-risk couples, and pilot studies are in progress to assess the feasibility of such screening. With regard to these factors, the possibility of gene therapy, and the questions raised, CF serves as a useful model for many genetic disorders.",cystic fibrosis

New therapies have entered the market and are part of the standard treatment of patients with CF, and have been associated with marked improvement in survival. Now there are even more promising therapies directed at different components of the pathophysiology of this disease. In this review, our current knowledge of the pathophysiology of lung disease in patients with CF is described, along with the current treatment of CF lung disease, and the therapies in development that offer great promise to our patients.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis was regarded a long time as exceptional in the Nord Africaine population and in particular in Tunisia what was at the origin of the ignorance of its various diagnostic and therapeutic aspects in our country. Nevertheless, with the development of the means of the diagnosis, several cases of cystic fibrosis were diagnosed these last years what will pose true problems of assumption of responsibility of these children like illustrates it well our experiment in the pediatric department of Sfax university hospital. In 10 years going of 1991 to 2000 we reported 7 cases of cystic fibrosis in the pediatric department of Sfax university hospital. Our patients are 3 boys and 4 girls. The age of revelation of the disease varied from 3 months to 14 years with 4 years and 10 months an average age. All our patients had a respiratory symptomatology in the foreground. The evolution was marked by the death of 4 patients at an average age of 5 years and half whereas the 3 surviving patients for the moment are more or less balanced on the nutritional level, digestive and respiratory. Cystic fibrosis is not exceptional in our area, its assumption of responsibility therapeutic is difficult, and it requires the collaboration of several experts and a good compliance of the child and of his family.",cystic fibrosis
"Genetically modified mouse strains are important research tools for the study of numerous human diseases. These models provide us with differentiated tissues, which are not often available from human sources. Furthermore, they allow for testing the effects of genetic manipulation and experimental therapeutics on physiology and pathology. Their importance relies on the assumption that biological processes in the mouse very closely resemble those in humans. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disease in the Caucasian population. CF is a monogenic disease whose phenotype variability is also attributed to genetic variation in other genes, the so-called modifier genes. Modulation of such modifier genes could be a therapeutic strategy to treat CF. CF mice models have been essential not only for understanding the disease better, but also for the discovery of modifier genes and testing of chemical compounds developed to repair the main protein dysfunction in CF, the CF transmembrane conductance regulator. Mice were also indispensable in gene therapy trials and for the study of CF and non-CF lung response to bacterial infections and inflammation challenges, although no spontaneous lung disease is developed in these mice. In this review, mouse models and their most important contribution to the understanding and management of CF will be presented and discussed.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is a lethal, hereditary, until recently little understood disease, which leads to progressive functional disturbances in various organs, including the lungs, liver and pancreas. Knowledge of the genetic and cellular abnormalities is rapidly progressing, but therapy is still symptomatic and based on insufficiently controlled and short-term studies. At present the therapeutic approach aims to combat respiratory infections by optimal antibiotic therapy, combined with techniques to promote sputum evacuation. Additional measures attempt to optimise both nutritional state and physical condition. Median survival has improved from approximately 1 year to about 25 years during the past 3 decades. This article summarises present information on disease mechanisms and treatment.",cystic fibrosis
"Although there has been impressive progress in the elucidation of the genetic and molecular basis of cystic fibrosis (CF), the pathogenesis of CF lung disease remains obscure. The elucidation of the pathogenesis of CF lung disease requires both a full description of normal innate airway defence and how absent function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (CFTR) adversely perturbs this activity. Recent data have linked the abnormal ion transport properties of CF airway epithelia to depleted airway surface liquid (ASL) volume, reflecting the combined defects of accelerated Na+ transport and the failure to secrete Cl-. Depletion of a specific compartment of the ASL, i.e. the periciliary liquid (PCL), appears to abrogate both cilia-dependent and cough clearance. Subsequent to PCL depletion, mucus adheres to airway surfaces and persistent mucin secretion generates the formation of ""thickened"" mucus plaques and plugs, which become the nidus for bacterial infection. The paucity of liquid in these plaques/plugs, and the hypoxia in this environment, appear to promote biofilm bacterial infection. Therapeutic agents that restore airway surface liquid volume, i.e. blockers of Na+ transport, initiators of Cl- transport and osmolytes, are reviewed, as are strategies that may be required to use volume-restoring agents safely in patients with cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis

"Background: We present the results of a study of adults with cystic fibrosis, with an emphasis on their experience of symptoms and treatment, future prospects, and quality of life. Material and methods: 86 adults (above the age of 18) with cystic fibrosis, recruited through the Norwegian Centre for Cystic Fibrosis. The response rate was 84%; average age of respondents 29; 48% were women. Results: The most frequently reported symptoms were coughing, phlegm and fatigue. 26% experienced great difficulties living with cystic fibrosis. 75% were satisfied with their life and 71% had a positive outlook for the future. Lung function was the variable most strongly related to symptoms, treatment and outlook for the future. Interpretation: It is possible to experience life as good even though one is living with a life-threatening disease such as cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by chronic lung and sinus disease, impaired mucociliary clearance (leading to recurrent pulmonary infection), pancreatic insufficiency, elevated sweat chloride levels and male infertility. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel in the plasma membrane of epithelial cells lining the lung, pancreas, liver, intestines, sweat duct, and the epididymis. Genetic mutations in CFTR affect its synthesis, processing, and transport to the plasma membrane and/or impede its function as a chloride channel and conductance regulator. Research is proceeding on multiple fronts including inhalational agents, anti-inflammatory treatments, and pancreatic replacement therapies. Furthermore, improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to CFTR dysfunction has stimulated the design of therapeutic strategies aimed at restoration of CFTR function, or ""protein repair therapy"". Recent clinical trials have shown these interventions have the ability to restore some level of CFTR function in vivo. This review will provide an overview of recent clinical trials that investigate new therapeutic approaches in CF designed to treat chronic respiratory infection, reduce inflammation, and improve pancreatic enzyme supplementation as well as trials addressing the greatest therapeutic challenge--restoring the function of the CFTR protein.",cystic fibrosis
"Survival in patients with cystic fibrosis has considerably improved over the last years. Young adults are particularly concerned. Fertility in these patients is greatly decreased, especially in men due to obstructive azoospermia. In women, intra-uterine insemination with her spouse's sperm can overcome anomalies in the cervical glair. Several pregnancies in patients with cystic fibrosis have been reported, especially in women with a mild form of the disease. Prematurity is frequent, about 35% as is perinatal mortality related to the mother's status. When lung involvement is severe leading to major obstruction and hypoxia, cor pulmonae and denutrition, pregnancy remains a contraindication. Care for pregnant women (when pregnancy is possible) should rely on a multidisciplinary team and include a rigorous nutritional and anti-infection support.",cystic fibrosis

"Life tables were calculated for 205 South Australians with cystic fibrosis. An improvement in survival was noted between 1948 and 1982. Ninety-three per cent of patients who were diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis after 1973 were alive at 14 years of age, compared with 40% of those who were diagnosed between 1948 and 1973. A Cystic Fibrosis Clinic was established in 1973 and much of this improvement is attributed to the care provided by this centre. Deaths from meconium ileus fell from 58% of infants with this complication between 1948 and 1973 to only 8% between 1973 and 1983, in spite of the increasing incidence of patients who were chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (currently 68% of patients). These figures are similar to those from Victoria and from other cystic fibrosis centres in North America. The improvement in survival means that adults now comprise a quarter of the patients with cystic fibrosis in South Australia, and that adult institutions need to be aware of these patients and their needs.",cystic fibrosis
"Epidemiologic data demonstrate a dramatic improvement in survival for cystic fibrosis (CF) over the last few decades and projections suggest that trend will continue. Standard therapy works and should be aggressively applied to this patient population. Although the specific therapies have evolved over the years, the basic tenets of CF care remain unchanged and include antibiotics to control infection, airway clearance, and adequate nutrition. This article focuses on treatment of the pulmonary disease and includes a discussion of the following specific components of a standard therapeutic approach to CF: (1) antibiotics, (2) airway clearance and exercise, (3) mucolytics, (4) bronchodilators, (5) oxygen, (6) anti-inflammatory therapies, and (7) nutritional support. Judicious application of these therapies coupled with careful monitoring of pulmonary, nutritional, and metabolic parameters results in most CF patients surviving into adulthood with an acceptable quality of life.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare disease among Asians. Three Malay children with CF presenting with recurrent pulmonary symptoms, malabsorption and failure to thrive are reported. Problems in their management include availability of pancreatic enzymes, compliance to medications and climate factors.",cystic fibrosis
"While fifty years ago 20 p. 100 of cystic fibrosis patients only reached the age of one year, more than 50 p. 100 of the patients now live more than twenty years. The clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis are more diverse in adults than in children, so that the diagnosis might concern several specialties. In actual fact, only 3 to 7 p. 100 of cystic fibroses are diagnosed after thirteen to sixteen years, and in half the cases the symptoms had been present before the age of one year. In adults, the respiratory manifestations of cystic fibrosis are predominant, whereas the gastrointestinal manifestations tend to be blurred. Radiography of the chest shows interstitial lesions (opacities, cystic images, disorders of ventilation), principally located in the right side and the apex. The most common functional defect is an obstructive syndrome corresponding to a gradual involvement of the peripheral airways. A number of complications may develop, including recurrent Pseudomonas infection of the lung, pneumothorax, heart failure, malnutrition, liver cirrhosis, episodes of intestinal occlusion, etc. The longer life span of these patients raises the problems of diabetes with its vascular complications, infertility or pregnancy, social and professional insertion, and so forth. The prognosis of cystic fibrosis in adults depends on the date the diagnosis was made, on the therapeutic follow-up and on the creation of specialized centres. The control of Pseudomonas infections and the development of lung transplantation are the main advances to be expected.",cystic fibrosis
"This study provides detailed data on the current characteristics, perceptions and outcomes of 45 young people with cystic fibrosis (CF) as they transition into adulthood. Although many had severe disease, they generally coped well, found attendance at a transition clinic helpful and welcomed the increased independence of an adult healthcare environment. Levels of psychological distress were low with only 15.6% having anxiety and 6.7% depression. The main psychological coping strategy used was optimistic acceptance. Overall, most remained stable after transfer but 33% had some decline in lung function and 9% in nutritional status, requiring intensification of treatment. They had high levels of satisfaction with their relationships and life situations and 76% were in employment or education. These results are encouraging and as life expectancy improves, young adults with CF are coping well with transition into adulthood.",cystic fibrosis
"Once regarded as a disease of infants and young children, cystic fibrosis now also must be considered a disease of adolescents and young adults. Disease complications and management, including hemoptysis, pneumothorax, sinusitis, pancreatic deficiency, and intestinal obstruction, are discussed in this review. In addition, a practical approach to the clinical evaluation, follow-up, and treatment of the older cystic fibrosis patient is presented for the physician who has not had extensive experience in managing these patients. Current research in identifying the CF gene, basic defect, and the use of heart-lung transplants is discussed.",cystic fibrosis
"Despite significant progress in therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF), most patients with the disease still die before the age of 30 years. Published discussions and descriptions of end-of-life care of patients with CF have been few, but interest in these issues is increasing. Descriptions of end-of-life care for persons with CF have begun to appear, and conflicting models of care have been proposed. Advanced care planning offers an opportunity for persons with CF to actively influence the type of care they will receive. Still, more empiric research and ethical discussion is needed to facilitate optimal end-of-life care of patients with CF.",cystic fibrosis
"The achievement and maintenance of energy balance in cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the central aims of management. Growth retardation in affected children and wasting in CF adults remain major clinical problems. We consider the basis for the energy deficit, examine the spectrum of nutrient imbalance and review the current guidelines for dietary management.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease commonly found among the Caucasian population. The availability of sweat test and with increasing experience have made it possible to diagnose more cases of CF. Our first case of CF was diagnosed 16 years ago and to date we have managed sixteen cases of CF. Sixteen children were diagnosed with CF in our units at the Paediatric Institute and University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). They were referred with either one or all of the following symptoms: i) recurrent pneumonia, ii) bronchiectasis, iii) failure to thrive, iii) malabsorption or iv) history of meconium ileus obstruction during the neonatal period. When the clinical features suggested strongly of CF, sweat tests will be performed in duplicates and considered positive when the sweat chloride or sweat sodium was more than 60 mmol/l for both results. Seventy- two hours fecal fat excretion or stool for fat globule was performed to document malabsorption. From the year 1987 to 2003, 16 patients were confirmed to have cystic fibrosis in Malaysia by positive sweat tests. Thirteen patients were diagnosed in Paediatric Institute while the remaining three were diagnosed in UMMC. On follow-up two patients died due to severe bronchopneumonia at the age of two years old. Although once considered rare, CF should now be considered in any children with clinical presentations of recurrent chest infections, bronchiectasis, in the presence or absence of malabsoption stmptoms and in neonates with meconium ileus obstruction.",cystic fibrosis
"In the past three decades, scientists have had immense success in identifying genes and their variants that contribute to an array of diseases. While the identification of such genetic variants has informed our knowledge of the etiologic bases of diseases, there continues to be a substantial gap in our understanding of the factors that modify disease severity. Monogenic diseases provide an opportunity to identify modifiers as they have uniform etiology, detailed phenotyping of affected individuals, and familial clustering. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is among the more common life-shortening recessive disorders that displays wide variability in clinical features and survival. Considerable progress has been made in elucidating the contribution of genetic and nongenetic factors to CF. Allelic variation in CFTR, the gene responsible for CF, correlates with some aspects of the disease. However, lung function, neonatal intestinal obstruction, diabetes, and anthropometry display strong genetic control independent of CFTR, and candidate gene studies have revealed genetic modifiers underlying these traits. The application of genome-wide techniques holds great promise for the identification of novel genetic variants responsible for the heritable features and complications of CF. Since the genetic modifiers are known to alter the course of disease, their protein products become immediate targets for therapeutic intervention.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting condition which is readily diagnosed in the vast majority of cases on newborn screening [NBS]. A diagnosis made on newborn screening translates into earlier initiation of therapies, improved growth, better lung function into the adult years and culminates in better survival.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis and the various conditions associated with ciliary dysmotility are well known to the otolaryngologist. Although the underlying pathophysiology and clinical courses of these diseases are quite different, they both involve chronic and acute infection in the paranasal sinuses. Some patients may suffer from persistent ear disease beyond early childhood. A high index of suspicion and early diagnosis are key to managing these conditions. The otolaryngologist often is the first to suspect and confirm the diagnosis and may have an important role in the overall management of these patients.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is the most common life threatening, inherited disease of the Caucasians. Ever since the gene for this disease was delineated in 1989, there are about 900 mutations discovered so far. This disease is being reported with increasing frequency from North India now. We present our experience with the diagnosis and management of cystic fibrosis in children seen at Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.",cystic fibrosis
"Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are living longer, albeit with chronic and progressive lung disease. Pulmonary exacerbations in CF are characterized by an increase in respiratory symptoms and a decrease in pulmonary function and gas exchange. Exacerbations that do not respond to outpatient management require hospitalization. Complications of CF can be devastating and life-threatening. Care of these patients is challenging not only because of the scope and severity of their medical problems, but also because of the need to coordinate services and to maintain continuity during transitions between hospital and home.",cystic fibrosis
"The clinical features and current management of cystic fibrosis are reviewed, with emphasis on pulmonary manifestations. Pulmonary radiographic findings in cystic fibrosis are illustrated. The role of transplantation as a therapeutic avenue is discussed. Recent discoveries--the specific genetic mutation in cystic fibrosis, the elucidation of the cellular defect, and the development of gene-transfer techniques to correct the cellular defect in vitro--have generated fresh excitement in the search for an ultimate cure for cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is now an adult disease. The understanding of the basic pathophysiology of this disease has increased considerably over the past decade. This has resulted in effective management protocols and the development of innovative approaches to therapy. Management of young adults is complex and requires expert medical care delivered in a sensitive and appropriate way. The daily treatment schedule for many adults involves physiotherapy; nebulized, oral and i.v. drugs; exercise and nutritional supplements. Adherence to such treatment while living a busy school, work and social life is extremely difficult for patients. The psychological implications of having a disease with very significant morbidity and mortality also has an enormous impact on individuals with CF. Many of these issues have evolved as survival has increased and the next few decades may produce more unexpected 'genies'. These may be from the disease itself or from some of the exciting new treatments currently being developed. It is important that individuals with CF are fully involved in decisions relating to their treatment and that CF teams provide optimal and appropriate care to enable these young adults to enjoy their lives to the fullest extent.",cystic fibrosis
"Under the Medicare prospective payment system, which is based on diagnosis-related groups, patients with certain diseases may be inappropriately classified. To study this problem using cystic fibrosis as an example, we examined discharge-abstract data from 14 cystic fibrosis centers in a comparison of resource-use requirements by patients with cystic fibrosis and other patients in the same diagnosis-related group. There were 1763 patients with cystic fibrosis and 25,628 other patients in the 87 diagnosis-related groups that contained at least one patient with cystic fibrosis. For the eight diagnosis-related groups in which patients with cystic fibrosis were classified most often, the average length of stay of patients with cystic fibrosis was 14.9 days, as compared with an average of 8.3 days for the other patients (P less than 0.001). For three hospitals, we were able to convert charges to costs. The average cost of treating patients with cystic fibrosis was $7,262, as compared with $2,908 for all other patients in the same diagnosis-related group (P less than 0.001). The ratio between the costs of treating patients with cystic fibrosis and other patients (2.5) was greater than the ratio between the lengths of stay for the two groups (1.8), reflecting the more intense use of resources by the patients with cystic fibrosis. A possible solution to the problem of misclassification is to define one or more new diagnosis-related groups for cases of cystic fibrosis or determine a new location within the diagnosis-related group system so that patients with cystic fibrosis can be classified with patients who use similar amounts of resources.",cystic fibrosis
"Malnutrition is recognised as a major prognostic factor adversely affecting survival in cystic fibrosis (CF) and is the result of an unfavourable energy balance in these patients. A high resting energy expenditure, dependent on the patient's genotype, in addition to pulmonary infection play an important role in producing anorexia and weight loss. Nutritional management with the aim to gain weight and catch up with growth is age-specific. It is important to repair nutritional status as early as possible after diagnosis. In infancy breast feeding is advised with, if necessary, supplemental feeding with predigested formulae such as Pregestimil. In childhood nutritional management must be aimed towards a normal weight gain and growth velocity. The latter is the best guide of nutritional adequacy. If weight gain falters the first principle is to treat any associated respiratory infection, the second is to ensure adequate enzyme therapy and control of steatorrhoea, and only then should dietary energy supplements be introduced. When oral hypernutrition fails, nocturnal naso-gastric tube feeding of a non-elemental formula may be considered. Parenteral nutrition is rarely indicated and should be reserved as a last solution for CF-patients.",cystic fibrosis
"The diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis require the presence of 1 or more typical clinical features, a family history of cystic fibrosis, or a positive newborn screening test, plus laboratory evidence of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator dysfunction. However the present case was an adopted baby with persistent pneumonia since birth, his health had been deteriorating rapidly. He was becoming very listless, malnourished, and the whole family had lost all hope of the baby's survival. Diagnosis early and effective management resulted in the baby being discharged after 15 days of hospitalisation with an improvement in clinical condition and increase in weight of the baby. We would like to stress on the fact that children who present with recurrent wheezing in combination with failure to thrive must be iInvestigated for cystic fibrosis in the initial workup.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in cystic fibrosis transport regulator (CFTR) gene. The clinical picture is characterized mainly by: bronchopulmonary disease (BPD), exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, hepatobiliary disease, meconium ileus, malnutrition and congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens. Life-span is closely related to respiratory system status, thus making the treatment of the BPD the key element of the management of CF. BPD is characterized by progressive destruction of bronchopulmonary tissues. It is due to chronic inflammation which, in turn, is caused chronic colonization/infection by typical pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia cepacia. The end stage of the BPD is respiratory insufficiency and death. The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is based on the clinical picture, sweat chloride test, molecular analysis and measurement of nasal potential difference.",cystic fibrosis
"More patients with cystic fibrosis are surviving into adulthood. Primary care physicians need a basic understanding of adult cystic fibrosis and the evaluation of patients with acute decompensation. Respiratory decompensation is usually the result of infective agents, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stentrophomonas maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia, and requires treatment with intravenous antibiotics. If symptoms worsen, the possibility of another complication, such as pneumothorax, hemoptysis, mycobacterial infection and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, must be considered. Family physicians can play an important role in the birth to adult care of patients with cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting exocrine gland function. Formerly a deadly disease of infants and children, recent improvements in antibiotics, nutritional therapy, and supportive care have extended the median survival to adulthood. Patients with CF commonly go to an otolaryngologist with a myriad of medical and surgical problems. Fortunately, the treatment and management of CF have rapidly evolved during the past few years, and changes in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment are occurring almost daily. As physicians on the forefront of care for patients with CF, otolaryngologists need to be aware of the new developments in the management of CF. An overview of CF is presented with an emphasis on the current treatment strategy and what the next decade brings for this formerly lethal disease.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease affecting mainly the Caucasian population. In recent years there have been major advances in understanding the genetics and pathophysiology of the disease. Cystic fibrosis affects many organs, but predominantly the respiratory system and alimentary tract. Current treatment including chest physiotherapy, antibiotics, good nutrition and enzyme therapy, together with the complications of the disease are described. Even with the best modern treatment there is still a significant morbidity and mortality. New advances in treatment, which offer hope for the future, are explored.",cystic fibrosis
"The improving survival rates of young people with cystic fibrosis now results in reproductive health being of greater significance than previously. This article reviews how cystic fibrosis affects the reproductive health of male and female patients with this chronic illness, highlights recent advances, and identifies some deficiencies that still exist in our understanding of reproductive health in cystic fibrosis. A further aim is to encourage health professionals to discuss reproductive health issues with their adolescent and adult patients.",cystic fibrosis
"Previously considered a pediatric disorder, cystic fibrosis (CF) is becoming a more common complication of pregnancy as these patients have increasing life expectancies. CF produces profound physiologic alterations in major organ systems. These alterations augment the physiologic changes of pregnancy. Perinatal nurses can meet the complex needs of these patients by increasing their understanding of the disease process, pregnancy-related alterations, and current treatment modalities.",cystic fibrosis
"Because of improved survival in the past two decades, liver disease has assumed greater importance in patients with cystic fibrosis. Clinical detection has been difficult thus far. In recent years, advances in our understanding of pathogenesis as well as increasing experience in therapeutic modalities have been accomplished. For these reasons, it is relevant to review this topic.",cystic fibrosis
"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis or mucoviscidosis is a genetically caused disease. The intensity of disease and histopathological changes grow throughout the life. According to the literature, pathological changes characteristic of cystic fibrosis become noticeable around the sixth month of life. Case report: After amniocentesis of a 5-lunar month-old fetus had been done, which confirmed cystic fibrosis, the Ethics Commission approved the preterm labor. The autopsy and histopathological analysis demonstrated the existence of typical histopathological changes in the pancreas and intestines. Discussion: In the late fetal period or during the period around the delivery, cystic fibrosis is usually manifested as meconial cap with or without obstruction of the intestinal lumen. Morphological changes in the exocrine glands usually develop only after birth. In this case, the existence of meconial obstruction, as well as the typical acidofil content in the secretory ducts and acini of the pancreas was confirmed, which is unusual for the fetal age of five months.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) is described in a review article. The cause of this common lethal hereditary disease of white people is hitherto unknown. The early dead of patients with cystic fibrosis, a genetic paradoxon, a lot of hypotheses and very high demands in treatment should challenge more scientists for research. There are added some short notes about the authors work in history of cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"The paper describes the genetic and pathophysiological basis of cystic fibrosis. The most frequent manifestations of the disease are listed and the currently available therapeutic options, both causal and symptomatic, are presented. Special emphasis is placed on the often underestimated nutritional management. The role of multidisciplinary teams and of the active involvement of patients and their families is stressed. The creation of a coherent cystic fibrosis health care system (both in paediatrics and internal medicine) on a regional and nation-wide scale will undoubtedly play an important role in successful treatment.",cystic fibrosis
"Growth failure is a common presentation of patients with pancreatic insufficient cystic fibrosis. However, full blown kwashiorkor is extremely rare.

"The cystic fibrosis gene specifies a membrane transport protein and over 100 disease-causing mutations have now been identified. Although at least some of these determine the incidence of pancreatic disease, there is no association between a particular mutation and the severity of lung and liver disease.",cystic fibrosis
Primary care physicians now see adult patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) who have multi organ consequences of the disease that present a complex management dilemma. Early diagnosis and treatment of these problems is important to limit morbidity. In this article we will review common problems experienced by these patients and present approaches to their management.,cystic fibrosis
"Because of the multiple systems involved in cystic fibrosis, the variability and chronicity of the disease, and the increased survival of this population, a specialty team of experts for care has evolved. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to assist patients and their families in adjusting to the disease and to optimize treatment interventions. The dietitian is responsible for assessment of nutritional status, including the determination of energy requirements and eating habits, interpretation of anthropometric data, and evaluation of nutritional adequacy. The nutrition care plan forms an integral part of the overall treatment objectives and is reported to other team members as it is devised, implemented, and monitored. A consensus report issued in April 1990 by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation includes both general nutrition guidelines and detailed recommended treatment standards aimed at providing optimal nutrition care.",cystic fibrosis
"Advances in therapy have largely contributed to the increased life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis. Unlike children, adults with cystic fibrosis must take responsibility for their own care. We administered a questionnaire to 23 adult patients (aged 18-39 years) with cystic fibrosis to (1) determine patients' degree of compliance with medications and chest physiotherapy; (2) collect information on their self-assessment of health motivation, disease severity, and benefits of treatment; and (3) identify barriers to receiving medical care. Patients reported better compliance with medications than with chest physiotherapy. Nine percent of the patients missed at least 25 percent of prescribed medication, whereas 47 percent missed at least 25 percent of prescribed physiotherapy. We observed a trend toward better compliance in patients who were highly worried about their health, who believed their illness to be serious, and who felt that their medications were very effective. Less than half of the study participants believed physiotherapy to be effective, and that adhering to a physiotherapy schedule was very difficult. Among adults with cystic fibrosis, compliance can be a serious problem that minimizes the benefits of good medical care. We suggest that emphasizing the severity of disease and usefulness of therapy may improve compliance and requires study.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF), a lethal disease common to Caucasians, is characterized by a defect in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator and the resulting defective cAMP-regulated Cl- secretion by epithelial cells. Clinical manifestations include both pancreatic and pulmonary insufficiency. Traditional therapeutic modalities address these problems with pancreatic enzyme replacement, vitamins and nutritional supplementation, antibiotics, and respiratory therapy. However, newer therapies directed at the specific underlying defects have emerged. In this review, we discuss agents that increase Cl- secretion via preserved Cl- secretory pathways, such as uridine triphosphate, or that enhance Na+ resorption, such as amiloride, thereby correcting altered airway secretions. We also discuss agents, including deoxyribonuclease (DNase), that directly reduce sputum viscosity. CF is an early target for in vivo gene therapy, since it is a monogenic autosomal recessive disease in which restoration of normal cAMP-regulated Cl- conductance can be achieved by complementation with a normal gene. The early clinical gene therapy therapy work, with gene introduction by both viral and nonviral vectors, is discussed.",cystic fibrosis
The association between salty skin and early death has been recognized since medieval times but the first description of cystic fibrosis was not published until 1938 by Anderson. Over teh last 53 years attitudes to the disease have changed radically and modern aggressive care involving a wide variety of professionals has contributed to the improved life expectancy.,cystic fibrosis
"Airway infection and inflammation occur early in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, suggesting the need for early treatment. Our current approach to routine management of CF includes a comprehensive, CF center-directed program that aims at maintaining normal nutrition and delaying the progression of lung disease. Regular secretion clearance, frequent antibiotics, and bronchodilators are commonly used. However, despite this early, aggressive comprehensive management, airway inflammation and infection progress. Several other recent approaches such as the use of corticosteroids and ibuprofen to decrease inflammation, as well as dornase alfa to thin secretions and improve pulmonary function, are under investigation in young children. Other potential treatments include amiloride/uridine triphosphate and hypertonic saline aerosol. Early treatment offers the promise of reducing morbidity as well as delaying the progression of later disease.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary disease, characterized by chronic pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency and abnormal electrolytes in the sweat. In order to evaluate the clinical manifestations and laboratory findings of Iranian children with CF during a 10-year period, 243 CF patients, with a median age of 5 months, were investigated in this study. The most common manifestations were gastrointestinal disorders and respiratory manifestations. Cough was the most common symptom, followed by malnutrition, diarrhea, respiratory distress, and vomiting. The frequency of these findings after treatment was significantly decreased in comparison with the period before diagnosis. During the mean follow-up of 40.9 months, seven cases died due to severe infections. Cystic fibrosis as a common genetic disorder should be considered in any child with recurrent gastrointestinal and respiratory manifestations, since delayed diagnosis could lead to severe complications and even death in this group of patients.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-threatening genetic condition in the Caucasian population. Since the complete pathologic description of the disease in 1938, tremendous progress has been made in identifying its genetic basis, the pathophysiology of CF lung disease, and the development of new therapies. This issue of CRAI will review several areas of progress in our understanding and treatment of CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Lung transplantation has become a valid therapeutic option for cystic fibrosis patients with end-stage lung disease. The indication for transplantation does not rely on strict criteria only but must be evaluated case by case. In particular, the dynamics of the clinical course need to be considered with regard to impaired physical performance, recurrent infections, decline in pulmonary function and weight loss. Important risk factors are a poor nutritional status, osteoporosis, liver involvement, previous pleurodesis and the occurrence of multiresistant bacteria. Management and assessment of cystic fibrosis patients for lung transplantation is complex. Therefore patients should be referred to specialised centres at an early stage.",cystic fibrosis
"Clinical information systems and electronic records are starting to appear in secondary care and herald new potentials for improving health provision and capturing high quality data. In 2006, we set up a program to develop electronic patient records (EPR) for chronic disease using Cystic Fibrosis (CF) as our initial model. Seven years on we are now exploring the real time clinical data to identify risks, trends and outcomes in chronic disease management. We are also working to establish new models of integration and to connect information between the client and all areas of health care.",cystic fibrosis
"The syndrome of infantile bronchiolitis in cystic fibrosis (CF) carries a high mortality. Fifteen cases of CF encountered over the past 19 years with severe bronchiolitis with onset during the first 6 months of life are described. Treatment include steroids in high doses. All patients recovered. Further progress resembled the usual natural course of CF and showed no evidence of persisting lung damage. The mechanism of this syndrome is not clear and is probably dependent on many factors involved in early lung disease in CF. The frequency of severe bronchiolitis in cystic fibrosis may not be high, but it continues to be seen in clinical practice today.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis has been regarded as a disease of infants. Yet, with improved management, a high percentage of patients how survive into young adulthood. In addition, mild cases may not be detected until long after infance. The older patient often has minimal symptoms, and the majority are socially active and productive.",cystic fibrosis
"This article outlines the clinical features and investigation of cystic fibrosis. The need for a multidisciplinary approach in specialist centres is highlighted. Future developments, particularly heart lung transplantation and research into the underlying genetic and biochemical abnormality, are discussed.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis in patients over 40 is rare. We report a 52-year-old woman in whom cystic fibrosis was confirmed by sweat analysis. This patient represents the oldest cystic fibrosis patient (with confirmatory sweat chlorides) ever described. We conclude that any patient with the appropriate clinical presentation, regardless of age, should be investigated for cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is a lethal autosomal recessive disorder. In 1989, the cystic fibrosis gene was isolated on chromosome 7. Positional cloning, linkage analysis, saturation cloning, and chromosome jumping enabled the isolation and cloning of the gene that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Current work focuses on the safe, efficient delivery of a functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance gene to patients who are afflicted with cystic fibrosis and the expression of the gene in somatic cells to correct the genetic defect and restore chloride channel function. It is hoped that successful gene therapy will be a feasible and cost-efficient approach that will lead to a cure.",cystic fibrosis
"The authors report on three infants with cystic fibrosis (CF), with different genotypes, presenting with different clinical manifestations, but having similar abnormal serum electrolytes (i.e. hyponatremia, severe hypochloremia and metabolic alkalosis). Despite the diagnostic investigations, the child who presents with severe electrolyte imbalance especially persistent hypochloremia and a family history of early infant death with respiratory or gastrointestinal problems should point to a diagnosis of CF Early identification and treatment remain critical to effective management. The diagnostic tool used, especially the sweat test, is needed for diagnostic investigations in Thailand.",cystic fibrosis
"After an experimental neonatal screening program for cystic fibrosis had been carried out in the Netherlands during 1973 to 1979, a follow-up study to evaluate the effects of neonatal screening was started in 1980. Although before 1980 the management of patients with cystic fibrosis was partly left to local hospitals, from the start of the follow-up program all patients in the study received similar treatment. A cumulative survival rate, calculated with exclusion of the patients with meconium ileus, showed at the age of 11 years a significantly better survival rate (p less than 0.05) for the 19 patients from the screened population (88%) than for the 25 patients from the nonscreened population (60%). Clinical condition was assessed on entry and at the age of 9 years in 16 screened and 20 nonscreened patients. On entry, comparison showed significantly better chest radiograph scores for the screened patients but no other significant differences. At the age of 9 years, after several years of similar treatment for all patients in the study, significantly better clinical (p less than 0.02) and chest radiograph scores (p less than 0.01), lower IgG levels (p less than 0.05), and higher vitamin A levels (p less than 0.01) were observed in the screened patients. Our study results suggest that early diagnosis and appropriate treatment may prevent serious deterioration and death at a young age, and may reduce the extent of early irreversible lung damage in patients with cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis was diagnosed in two female infants, respectively nine months old (Case 1) and six months old (Case 2). Clinical presentation of these two infants showed frequent episodes of pneumonia, dehydration and poor weight gain, despite fair intake of food since birth. Hyponatremic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis had been found during their previous hospitalizations. In Case 1, stool fat was positive with negative trypsin test. Both cases had abnormal findings on chest X-ray films, but the pancreas showed no remarkable cystic changes from sonography. Plastic-bag method of sweat test showed Na/Cl: 155/185 nmol/L in Case 1, Na/Cl: 127/135 nmol/L in Case 2. A family history was suggested, since each one had an elder brother who had died in early infancy with similar clinical presentations. Both patients were put on special diet therapy as well as chest physical therapy. Case 1 died suddenly at 16 months of age. Autopsy revealed mucusplugged dilated ducts with atrophy of the exocrine portion of the pancreas. DNA analysis in Case 2 showed abnormal mutation point at 1898+5 G-->T on chromosome 7.",cystic fibrosis
"Recent developments in DNA technology mean that all individuals can be tested to identify whether they carry one of the known mutations for cystic fibrosis. This testing will allow people to know whether they are at risk to have a child with cystic fibrosis. However, this knowledge has the potential to create harm if the testing programs are not managed carefully. Implications of this new technology for nurses and the general public are discussed.",cystic fibrosis
"In this article I present a socio-historical analysis of the definition and diagnosis of one particular genetic disease--cystic fibrosis (CF)--in an effort the better to understand its social context both before and after the advent of molecular genetics. I begin my analysis with some background on the history of CF, before moving on to consider the emergence of the notion of classic CF, the development of the sweat test, early approaches to mild or variant forms of CF, the concept of CF as a genetic disease, the concept of CF as a collection of related disorders, and developments in the understanding and diagnosis of CF which came about in the wake of molecular genetics. I highlight a range of technological, professional and patient developments and how these stimulated new research, typologies and clinical tools. I also consider how different notions of CF were mobilised, either to support or undermine a particular approach to diagnosis or treatment, and consider how the dynamic and contextual characteristics of CF were accounted for by scientists and clinicians with an interest in CF. I end by discussing the implications of my analysis for the contemporary sociology of genetics, and related studies in the sociology of medicine more generally.",cystic fibrosis
"A woman aged 30 and a man aged 40, both with a bad general condition due to cystic fibrosis, showed a clear clinical improvement after they were treated in a cystic fibrosis centre, while in a young adult male patient the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis could be rejected. In the Netherlands there are approximately 1000 patients with cystic fibrosis. As a consequence most doctors have hardly any experience of the treatment of such patients. To optimize the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis, it would seem wise to concentrate experience and knowledge in several cystic fibrosis centres.",cystic fibrosis
Three Pueblo American Indian children with cystic fibrosis are described. The three cases constitute a higher incidence of cystic fibrosis in Pueblo Indians than would be expected from the known rarity of this disease in American Indian populations. This report discusses the possible genetic implications and emphasizes the need to consider the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in American Indians with appropriate symptoms.,cystic fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis is the most frequent and severe genetic disorder in caucasian children. It is a multisystemic disease progressively involving many organs. Patients' survival was poor most of them dying as children. There has been now however an important improvement of prognosis. The median survival is 38 years today. Such a progress is related to comprehensive care based not only on scientific research but multidisciplinary clinical approach implying physicians and paramedics. Moreover pediatricians stimulated already in the 1960s patient autonomy by supporting national and international patients organisations. This approach has greatly contributed to increase the visibility of this disease and its support in our society. Cystic fibrosis is a paradigm for improving care of chronic diseases in medicine.,cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is the most common, multiorgan inherited autosomal recessive disorder. The gene associated with this disease encodes the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).

Case report: We described the case of a 5.5-years-old girl with ascites and peripheral edema without of the symptoms. Laboratory tests revealed hepatic cell damage with cholestasis, extreme lipid abnormalities and hypocholesterolemia. Based on positive sweat test (CI: 122 mEq/l) and genetic analysis (homozygote deltaF508) the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis was confirmed. Patient was successfully treated with nutritional treatment and pancreatic enzymes.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is detected with increasing frequency in older children, adolescents, and even young adults. The quality of life and longevity in patients with cystic fibrosis is more favorable the earlier a diagnosis is made and a therapeutic regimen begun. This report presents and reviews five cases in chich the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis was made after the age of six years. Emphasis is placed on the variability of presenting signs and symptoms and the problems that can arise in confirming a suspected diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Seventy-six patients with cystic fibrosis seen between 1950 and 1964 were studied, all having been first seen before the age of 1 year. In retrospect, the year 1957 seemed to be a watershed in the treatment of this series of patients, and they were therefore divided into 2 groups. Group A, 30 patients seen before 1957; Group B, 46 patients seen after 1957. The clinical, radiological, and bacteriological findings in the 2 groups at entry were similar as to age of incidence, severity of the initial respiratory symptoms, abnormalities on chest radiographs, and bacteriology of the cultures of cough swabs. Treatment of Group B patients was generally more vigorous, with antibiotics used more efficiently to treat pulmonary infection. When the patients were followed up and their pulmonary status was assessed clinically and radiologically, at 1 year and at 5 years of age, Group B patients were found to be significantly less severely affected than Group A patients. It is concluded that vigorous treatment of cystic fibrosis can reduce mortality in infancy, and considerably improve the pulmonary status during childhood.",cystic fibrosis
"The survival of 320 patients, who were born in and after 1958 with cystic fibrosis and managed by the Departments of Thoracic Medicine and Gastroenterology, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, is reviewed. Eighty per cent of patients survived to 11 years of age, and 64% to 18 years. Of patients managed between 1973 and 1977, 91% survived to 12 years of age, and 80% to 17 years of age. In the same period, 79% of patients survived for 16 years after diagnosis. Forty-four per cent of the 240 patients currently being managed have no significant permanent lung disease, and only 9% have advanced disease.",cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis commonly is regarded as a disease of childhood associated with severe pulmonary and pancreatic pathological conditions. We report on a previously healthy 45-year-old man who was diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis after presentation with primary azoospermia. The literature is reviewed. Although references are made to late presentations of cystic fibrosis none was found in which the initial complaint was infertility. Primary azoospermia may be the presenting manifestation of cystic fibrosis in the absence of major respiratory symptoms.,cystic fibrosis
The inherent variability in the natural severity of cystic fibrosis (CF) makes each aspect of therapy of this condition difficult to isolate and to evaluate objectively. There is little hope of resolving the problems which arise as a result until a way of measuring the severity of the disease at any one point in time is devised. We present a simplified CF scoring system (analogous to the Apgar scoring system for the newborn) based on five simple measurements.,cystic fibrosis
"Bronchiectasis is defined in current medical parlance as the abnormal and permanent dilatation of one or more bronchi, and in clinical practice, the condition is often characterized by features of chronic bronchial infection. Apart from occurring as a primary lung disease, bronchiectasis is a major component of two other disease entities, cystic fibrosis and diffuse panbronchiolitis. Although the three conditions have distinctly different underlying causes, they share the similarity of a predominantly neutrophilic airways inflammation, and the persistent bronchial infection by bacteria, in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hence, new knowledge in one disease may be explored and applied in the others.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is a chronic, life-threatening inherited disease which poses severe physical, psychological and social problems for the sufferer and his or her family. Frances Duncan-Skingle and Fiona Foster present an overview of recent developments in the clinical management of this distressing condition.",cystic fibrosis
"The authors describe the rules of monitoring and treatment of cystic fibrosis at home. These rules apply to the respiratory component of the disease, which is often insidious and yet clinically predominant and has repercussions on the patient's nutritional status. They also apply to the hepatic and diabetic components, both of which must be recognized and treated. Most of the treatment can be carried out at home with obvious social, epidemiological, psychological and financial benefits.",cystic fibrosis
"There has been a major change in the outlook for children with cystic fibrosis during the last 20 years. Provided the diagnosis is made before serious irreversible lung disease has occurred, most patients can expect to reach adult life without very serious disability.",cystic fibrosis
Two patients with cystic fibrosis from the same family are reported. Both patients had features of chronic respiratory disease with evidence of pancreatic and other systemic manifestations. To our knowledge this is the first report from our country of cystic fibrosis multiplex cases occurring in the same family.,cystic fibrosis
We present the first report of two preterm infants who died from respiratory failure secondary to cystic fibrosis which presented in the early neonatal period.,cystic fibrosis
"In Germany, many adult patients with cystic fibrosis are still treated by pediatricians. There are still not enough specialists for internal medicine (and particularly pulmonologists) with sufficient knowledge about cystic fibrosis for the treatment of estimated 2000 adult CF-patients. The knowledge about the three basic principles of cystic fibrosis therapy--regular high-dose antibiotics, high-energy and high-fat nutritional support and specific physiotherapy--has to be transferred to adult medicine in order to assure competent care for this ""new"" group of patients. Cystic fibrosis is also becoming more and more and more important in the field of intensive care medicine and transplantation. Specific diagnostic procedures are important in adult respiratory medicine in order to confirm or exclude late manifestations of the disease. Understanding of the genetic basis of cystic fibrosis and the correlations between genotype and phenotype is beginning to emerge.",cystic fibrosis
"Here we report on the results of histopathological analysis of several organs of 5 foetuses and 2 newborn infants with cystic fibrosis. They were examined with HE, PAS, AB, HID and ""Stains-all"" techniques on paraffin sections. We concluded that there were significant differences in the epithelial mucin composition of several organs of the effected foetuses compared to 6 controls as early as the 17th week of gestation. An increase in the amount of neutral and acidic mucins was observed in the acini of the pancreas, bronchi and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract accompanied with a well defined decrease of sialic acid rich components of pharyngeal submucosal glands.",cystic fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis is the most common genetic disease. The basic defect is still unknown. The success in the treatment of pulmonary disease and nutrition transposes this pediatric disease into adult medicine.,cystic fibrosis
"After an experimental neonatal screening program for cystic fibrosis (CF) had been carried out in the Netherlands during 1973-1979, a follow-up study to evaluate the effects of neonatal screening was started in 1980. The results of this study suggest that early diagnosis and appropriate treatment may prevent serious deterioration and death at a young age, and may reduce the extent of early irreversible lung damage in patients with CF. The short period between the birth of an affected child and the diagnosis and the timely information on the high recurrence risk, may lead to a significant reduction in subsequent births in the case of neonatal screening. However it is still doubtful whether general neonatal screening for CF should be recommended, as treatment directed against the harmful effects of the genetic defect is not yet available.",cystic fibrosis
We have studied 70 carrier cystic fibrosis (CF) families with delta F508 mutation using the polymerase chain reaction (P.C.R.). We found that frequency of the mutation in CF chromosomes was 53%. 39% of carrier cystic fibrosis families were informative for the mutation.,cystic fibrosis
"The survival rate of 42 patients with cystic fibrosis diagnosed during the five year period before institution of full prophylactic aerosol, mist tent and postural drainage therapy in 1967 was compared with that of 32 cases diagnosed in the five following years. The mean survival rate of the latter group was 81%, 81% and 73% at 1, 2 and 3 years respectivly, compared with 64%, 59% and 57% in the former group. The main difference was due to the significantly improved survival rate of cases diagnosed during the first year of life.",cystic fibrosis
"Over an 11-year period, we encountered four cases in which an unexpected diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) was first established on the basis of typical autopsy findings. Our experience suggests that the occurrence of such cases is more common than generally appreciated and emphasizes the often crucial role of the autopsy in medical practice.",cystic fibrosis
"As children with cystic fibrosis (CF) survive longer, some who reach young adulthood are developing diabetes secondary to CF. The challenge to diabetes educators in managing these patients is to incorporate basic diabetes treatment into a life-style that includes chronic infections, variable food intakes, multiple demands on time for self-care procedures, and the psychosocial problems posed by cystic fibrosis. Of particular concern is a meal plan that will attain and maintain a desirable body weight and yet control blood glucose levels.",cystic fibrosis
"The first known case of a 20-year-old cystic fibrosis patient in Switzerland, ending at 40 weeks' gestation in delivery by cesarean section performed under peridural anesthesia is presented. Obstetric care of the patient was complicated by pneumonia during the 31st week of pregnancy. The epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical symptoms of cystic fibrosis, the problems anticipated during pregnancy, delivery and childbed in patients with cystic fibrosis, and the questions surrounding therapeutic abortion and contraceptive counseling are discussed.",cystic fibrosis
"Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal hereditary disease, adult physicians remain to be relatively unfamiliar with this disease. In Germany, more than 25 per cent of the 4,000 CF patients are adults, but are treated by paediatricians. The present paper aims to focus the pulmonologist's attention to this problem. A brief review is given on aspects of genetics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Centralized treatment by an experienced CF clinic is important not only for children, but also for adults, and the contribution of adult pulmonologists to the care of these patients is urgently needed.",cystic fibrosis
"The main aspects of the genetic cystic fibrosis, are reviewed; they are: incidence, pathophysiology, clinical signs and symptoms, treatment and prognosis. Emphasis is made on the infrequency of the diagnosis in Latin America. The pediatrician's attention is called in order to think in this possible diagnosis in cases of chronic pneumopathy with or without signs of poor intestinal absorption.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal recessive genetic disease affecting children in Europe and the US. CF is a multiorgan disease and may present a variety of clinical symptoms, like chronic obstructive lung disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (PI) and elevated sweat chloride concentration. CF mutations have also been found in other related clinical diseases such as congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), disseminated bronchiectasis and chronic pancreatitis. These clinical overlaps pose etiopathogenetic, diagnostic and therapeutic questions. Despite stunning advances in genomic technologies and drug discovery, drug therapy often improves disease symptoms but does not cure the disease. One of the main causes of this failure in CF cure may be attributable to genetic variability and to the scarce knowledge of CF biochemistry. Therefore, knowing the genotype of a patient might help improve drug efficacy, reduce toxicity and suggests innovative genomic-based therapy approaches.",cystic fibrosis
On the basis of the data available in the literature pertaining to the relatively high frequency of mucoviscidosis in children affected with Down's syndrome a hypothesis is advanced concerning the possible location of the mucoviscidosis gene in the chromosome 21. The author's own preliminary data are presented. Approaches to the verification of this hypothesis are described.,cystic fibrosis
"Purpose of review: The field of cystic fibrosis (CF) is changing dramatically as the scientific knowledge accumulated since the cloning of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene is being translated into effective therapies to correct the basic defect and provide better disease models and in-depth understanding of the basic mechanisms of disease. Recent findings: This review focuses on three main aspects of the recent advances in the field: understanding the lung disease pathophysiology (in particular, the early events that condition its onset), better definition of the complex microbiology of the CF airway, and therapeutic developments. Although the most recently developed therapies, whether approved or under study, do not constitute a definitive cure, the benefit to patients is already becoming clearly apparent. Summary: As the field continues to change rapidly and new therapies are being identified, CF has become a paradigm for the application of concepts such as translational medicine, genomic medicine, and personalized care, with measurable clinical benefit for the patients affected by this disease.",cystic fibrosis
"We report a case of cystic fibrosis diagnosed in a 27-year-old man complaining of diarrhoea which was present for 2 years. The diagnosis was suspected upon the association of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, massive hepatic steatosis, pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph, and moderate alterations of pulmonary function tests. It was confirmed by positive sweat tests. Study of the cystic fibrosis gene demonstrated a compound heterozygosity for delta F508 deletion and for mutation W1282X. Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis after the age of 25 is a rare event and the 25 hitherto published case reports are analysed after obtention of more detailed information for the authors. The existence of cases of late diagnosis might be explained by genetic heterogeneity.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that primarily affects the respiratory system and often leads to respiratory failure and premature death. Although pulmonary complications contribute to 85% of deaths, non-pulmonary complications are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in adults with CF. Areas covered: This review summarizes acute and chronic non-pulmonary complications in CF patients, with emphasis on emerging complications and in the context of the current growth and aging of the CF adult population. It also addresses the potential benefits of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy. Complications that occur after solid organ (e.g. lung and/or liver) transplantation have been excluded. The review is based on an extensive search of the available literature, using PubMed and international guidelines, and on the authors' clinical experience. Expert commentary: Acute non-pulmonary complications have been well described but should be recognized and managed carefully. Managing chronic non-pulmonary complications is an important and changing aspect of CF patient care, particularly with the emergence of novel complications in adults. Early detection of non-pulmonary complications is essential to the development of prevention and treatment strategies that aim to further improve the survival and health status of adult CF patients.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF), which is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, is the most common lethal genetic disease in the United States. Median survival age for patients followed up at CF centers in the US is now 21 years. While the disease is diagnosed in most patients before the age of 5 years, in 10% of cases the diagnosis is not confirmed until after age 12. We report an unusual family in which the diagnosis of CF was first established in three siblings at the ages of 36, 40, and 44 years. We describe the clinical features of the patients, as well as issues relating to the diagnosis of CF in adults. This unusual pedigree supports the concept of genetic heterogeneity in CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Chest physiotherapy, aiming to clear bronchopulmonary secretions, has become a mainstay in the respiratory management of cystic fibrosis (CF). Early diagnosis and new therapeutic interventions have dramatically improved the outlook for patients with this disorder and it is no longer a disease of childhood. Along with these changes chest physiotherapy has also progressed, with the development of several treatment modalities that are more effective and can be performed by the patient without assistance. This allows older children and adults with CF to lead more normal and independent lifestyles. Despite this progress questions remain regarding the efficacy and consequences of airway clearance techniques, the scientific evidence available to support the selection of the most appropriate treatment modality and, not least, the problems associated with the treatment-related burden that is placed on patients and their families.",cystic fibrosis
"Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) offers the opportunity for early medical and nutritional intervention that can lead to improved outcomes. Management of the asymptomatic infant diagnosed with CF through newborn screening, prenatal diagnosis, or sibling screening is different from treatment of the symptomatically diagnosed individual. The focus of management is on maintaining health by preventing nutritional and respiratory complications. The CF Foundation convened a committee to develop recommendations based on a systematic review of the evidence and expert opinion. These guidelines encompass monitoring and treatment recommendations for infants diagnosed with CF and are intended to help guide families, primary care providers, and specialty care centers in the care of infants with CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis has been previously reported in three children only in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This paper describes 12 Emirati children with the condition seen in a 1 year period in one medical district of the country. The disease is present in the severe, multisystem form in the UAE and these observations suggest that it is more common and more severe than previously recognized.",cystic fibrosis
"A better knowledge of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas has contributed to raise the detection of cystic fibrosis in adults. We describe nine Mexican patients older than 15 years with cystic fibrosis. Respiratory symptoms were predominant and they were secondary to bronchiectasis. All patients were infected by mucoid Pseudomona aeruginosa and in some cases, the finding of this microorganism in sputum suggested the diagnosis. In Mexican population the cystyc fibrosis of the pancreas can be found in adult patients, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic respiratory diseases in adults.",cystic fibrosis
"In the 21 years since the discovery of the gene that causes cystic fibrosis, our knowledge of how mutations in this gene cause the varied pathophysiological manifestations of this disease has increased substantially. This knowledge has led to the possibility of new therapeutic approaches aimed at the basic defect. This article summarizes our current knowledge of mutation-specific therapy, and focuses on orally bioavailable potentiators and correctors and suppressors of premature termination codons, including preclinical model systems and clinical trials in cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Respiratory virus infections have pronounced and long-lasting effects on patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), resulting in significant declines in FVC, FEV(1) and Shwachman score, significantly increasing both the frequency and duration of hospitalisation. Deleterious effects on patients with CF have been reported for most viruses studied but the effects of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza appear the greatest. There is circumstantial evidence that respiratory virus infections may facilitate bacterial infections, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is frequent monogenic disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and has a severe course and prognosis. Crucial for the patient's life are the nature and extent of lung injury, as well as the digestive system, especially the pancreas and liver. Since the late 1960's. appeared describing a combination of celiac disease and cystic fibrosis. Many authors believe their associated diseases. Cited the case of late diagnosis of celiac disease in patient with cystic fibrosis, diagnosed as late, which delayed the appointment of adequate therapy, severe violations of nutritional status and physical development of the child, the current weighting of the underlying disease.",cystic fibrosis
"Objective: To inform the development of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Foundation guidelines on the care of infants with CF, we systematically reviewed the evidence for diagnosis and assessment of pancreatic and pulmonary disorders; management of pancreatic and pulmonary function; management of nutrition and nutritional disorders; and prevention and control of infections. Study design: In May-June 2008, we searched The Cochrane Library for existing reviews; and MEDLINE, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, the CF Foundation Clinical Practice Guidelines and Consensus Statements, and the UK CF Trust for existing guidelines. MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and the Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE) were searched for primary studies in January 2008. Bibliographies of eligible articles were searched and expert input was sought. We selected English-language articles of any study design that provided original data on any of our questions on infants up to 2 years of age. Results: We identified 14 relevant guidelines and 3 Cochrane reviews. Fifty-nine articles (55 primary studies) were included. Only four of these were randomized controlled trials. Sample sizes of infants ranged from 2 to 768 study participants; the median sample size was 24. Of our 21 review topics, 5 topics had only one study while for 5 we identified no relevant studies. We identified one or no primary studies for 20 of 32 review questions. Conclusions: There is a paucity of evidence on the care of infants diagnosed with CF. For several of the review questions no guidelines or primary studies were identified, but for other questions, studies limited by weak design and small sample sizes were the only studies identified. With increasing numbers of infants with CF being diagnosed by newborn screening there is an opportunity to study the management of infants diagnosed with CF.",cystic fibrosis
"For the busy clinician, educator, or manager, it is becoming an increasing challenge to filter the literature to what is relevant to one's practice and then update one's practice based on the current evidence. The purpose of this paper is to review the recent literature related to invasive mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilation, and cystic fibrosis. These topics were chosen and reviewed in a manner that is most likely to have interest to the readers of Respiratory Care.",cystic fibrosis
"Recent researches confirm the recessive mendelian modality of hereditary transmission in Cystic Fibrosis. Two groups of factors contribute to the pathogenesis of respiratory disease: the secretive-obstructive and the infectious. It has also been ascertained that a large part of the respiratory complications are due to pseudomonas aeruginosa, above all to particular sub-groups which produce hexosepolisaccaridic masses. Even though immunological moments are present, it has been confirmed that the disease does not have a primary immunologic pathogenesis. Various recent acquisitions shed light on the fundamental alterations in pathophysiology of the disease. The most interesting developments regard: the glycoproteins of secretions and tissues; the activity of the enzymes involved in glycoproteins metabolism; the electrolytes regulation systems, in particular the intracellular calcium; the presence of abnormal proteins in plasma, urine, secretions and cells in culture; the characteristics of chemical mediator receptors. The modifications of the processes of glycosilation and hydrolysis of the glycoproteins are particularly significant. The most important and univocal observations regard the enzymes, sialyl-transferase and alpha-L-fucosidase, the former involved in the incorporation of sialic acid into the glycoproteins and the latter in the detachment of fucose from the glycoproteins. Polyamines, which participate in many phases of metabolism, as that of glycoproteins, have been found to present modifications of certain importance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is a systemic disease whose prognosis has improved thanks multidisciplinary researches and above all better knowledges and care of nutritional problems. It is important, for a good therapy, considering each case singularly, with a differentiated and individualized dietetic approach, which focuses on its specific needs and features. A ""step by step"" process could be useful to manage patient suffering from cystic fibrosis; it is based on 5 different patterns of possible nutritional dietetic methods. The development of the nutritional techniques of treatment for this kind of desease both with the individualized and differentiated approach have led to improve prognosis and especially the patient's standard of life.",cystic fibrosis
"Pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis. Although several criteria have been proposed for the definition of PEx, no consensus has yet been reached. Very often, many PEx cases go unreported. A standardized and validated definition is needed to reduce variability in clinical practice. The pathophysiology of recurrent episodes remains unclear, and both onset and risk are multifactorial. PEx leads to increased healthcare costs, impaired quality of life and a cycle in which PEx causes loss of lung function, which predisposes to further episodes. The number of episodes affects survival. Although early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are highly recommended, measures to prevent the emergence of new PEx are even more important. In particular, inhaled antibiotics administered under new treatment schedules could play a key role in preventing exacerbations and thus delay decline in lung function and reduce mortality. The primary objective is zero exacerbations.",cystic fibrosis
"The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation currently tracks about 20,000 Americans with cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive genetic disease that leads to multisystem complications. With the institution of better therapeutic regimens over the past 2 decades, more patients with this disease are surviving to adulthood. Within the past decade, both clinical and basic science research in the field of cystic fibrosis has progressed at a rapid rate. The intent of this review is to introduce readers to the molecular, cellular, and systemic disorders of this disease. We discuss treatment strategies involving antibiotics, nutrition, immune-response mediators, chest physiotherapy, and sputum-active agents with respect to the airway dysfunction of cystic fibrosis. Other common complications, recent developments, transplantation, and gene therapy are also reviewed.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) is a genetic disorder characterized by dysfunction of the exocrine glands. Ninety percent of the morbidity and mortality is due to repeated pulmonary infections and respiratory impairment. Pancreatic disease and intestinal complications result from thick, tenacious mucous secretions. Aggressive medical therapy has improved the prognosis. The family physician plays an important role in dealing with the psychologic and social aspects of the disease, as well as the medical management.",cystic fibrosis
"The role of exercise in aiding sputum expectoration in patients with cystic fibrosis and the comparative roles of exercise and physiotherapy in sputum expectoration were assessed in two studies. In the first study 19 adult patients undertook a two month programme of home exercise using a cycle ergometer. In the 12 patients completing the study peak work capacity, maximum oxygen consumption, and maximum minute ventilation had increased significantly by the end of the exercise programme; the increase in daily sputum weight (from 24 to 37 g) was not significant (p = 0.055). In the second study (with 10 patients) more sputum was expectorated during and after physiotherapy than during and after exercise (9.8 v 4.0 g). Exercise may have a role in aiding sputum expectoration in patients with cystic fibrosis but should not be considered as a replacement for physiotherapy.",cystic fibrosis
"The European Epidemiologic Registry of Cystic Fibrosis began collecting longitudinal data on European cystic fibrosis patients in 1994. A cross-sectional analysis was performed to identify the factors associated with low values of % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) upon patient enrollment. Data from 7,010 patients aged > or =6 yrs were included. Clinical conditions, microbiological isolates and medications reported at enrollment or within the following 180 days were analysed for age-specific associations. Factors associated with FEV1 that were lower by >10% of pred values were: lower weight for age percentiles, haemoptysis, pneumothorax, pulmonary symptoms at presentation, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, oral corticosteroids, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, dornase alfa, oxygen and assisted ventilation and, in patients >12 yrs old only, use of airway clearance techniques, inhaled bronchodilators, oral nutritional supplements, pancreatic enzymes and insulin or oral hypoglycaemics. Slightly impaired lung function (5-10%) was associated with: diabetes (> or = 18-yrs-old), gastro-oesophageal reflux, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, asthma-like symptoms, portal hypertension, Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. Sex, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus were not associated with impaired pulmonary status. Regular exercise (especially in older patients) and nasal polyposis were associated with slightly better FEV1. The results confirm those of previous studies and suggest selective prescribing in sicker patients.",cystic fibrosis
"Purpose of review: To review the contribution of various therapeutic interventions on both longevity and quality of life in cystic fibrosis patients. Recent findings: Long-term survival in cystic fibrosis has increased markedly in the past 25 years, largely due to a robust clinical trials program carried out at Cystic Fibrosis Foundation accredited clinical centers in the United States and similar organizations worldwide. Cystic fibrosis patients are recommended complex, time-intensive daily therapies that are often difficult for families and patients to sustain long-term. Recently, attention to the perceived value of a particular therapy on a patient's well being is recognized as important for individualizing therapeutic regimens that provide maximal clinical benefit and are more likely to be adhered to long-term by the patient. Cystic fibrosis care is in a new era in which patient-related outcomes (PROs) for the assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are regarded with equal importance to medically beneficial therapies. Summary: Numerous advances in the clinical care of cystic fibrosis have led to improved survival, although definitive correction of the abnormal cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein function remains elusive. Patients struggle to maintain rigorous, time-intensive therapeutic regimens, whereas clinicians strive to identify which interventions preserve quality of life. Cystic fibrosis patients depend on their caregiver's ability to assess both the medical benefit and the contribution to quality of life that therapeutic regimes bring to their disease. Caregivers, in turn, need measures of HRQOL in order to prioritize the various therapeutic interventions that are at their disposal in order to provide not just longevity, but meaningful quality of life.",cystic fibrosis
"This article is intended as a brief practical guide for physicians and physiotherapists concerned with the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Physiotherapeutic techniques for the treatment of chest diseases have been developed and modified as advances have taken place in the medical management of cystic fibrosis. The article describes forced expiratory technique, positive expiratory pressure, postural drainage, autogenic drainage and other techniques. Patients with cystic fibrosis live longer and have a better quality of life than ever before, but progressive deterioration of lung function will always be their most serious problem. Physical activity and chest physiotherapy are essential parts of all treatment regimens for cystic fibrosis. It is important to realize that the physiotherapist is a very important member of the team which includes nurses, physicians-and the patient.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive inherited disease of Caucasian populations. As a result of a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies there has been a dramatic increase in the life expectancy of patients with CF in the last decades and 50% of patients are now adults. This review will focus on the disease in adults and the provision of appropriate care. The complex care required to improve the survival and quality of life in the adult patients can best be provided in a dedicated adult cystic fibrosis unit. These units currently exist in many European countries, but more are needed in Italy.",cystic fibrosis
"The purpose of this paper is to give a brief overview of cystic fibrosis; its pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, which is caused by a mutation in the CFTR protein, a chloride channel in epithelial cell membranes. More than 1500 mutations are known. The incidence is 1/2.000-3.000 in nations of European origin. The CFTR mutation influences the secretion and absorption by epithelium in various organs. The consequences are different depending on the organ, but there is a global tendency for obstruction of secretory glands. The primary organs affected are the respiratory tract, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands. The disease is most often diagnosed during the first months of life, with a common presentation of salty tasting sweat, failure to thrive and diverse faecal problems. Possible diagnostic tools are sweat test and DNA testing. Respiratory symptoms cause most morbidity, with chronic infections and an exaggerated inflammatory response. Abnormal water and electrolyte composition leads to thicker respiratory secretions compared to that of healthy individuals. The interaction of pathogens with the epithelium causes S. aureus, and later P. aeuruginosa, to transform into a mucoid form which is much more difficult to eradicate with antibiotics, making them a significant part of the disease burden of cystic fibrosis. The main respiratory medications are antibiotics, bronchodilators, mucolytic agents and anti-inflammatory agents. 90% of cystic fibrosis patients have pancreas insufficiency which is treated with pancreas enzymes. A good nutritional status is a necessary basis for any further treatment. The prognosis of cystic fibrosis patients has improved greatly over the last few decades in parallel with increased knowledge, and the average survival is currently 37 years in the United States.",cystic fibrosis
"Known as a systemic disease, genetically conditioned, mucoviscidosis or cystic fibrosis brings together chronic obstructive bronchopathy, manifested since early childhood, chronic bronchial infection especially with pseudomonas or staphylococcus aureus, pancreatic impairment and a high clorum ratio in sweats. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is inducing the disease, 1 of 20 caucasians being carriers of this marker. Positive diagnosis is suggested when respiratory and digestive symptoms meet fertility disfunction and ""salty kiss"" due to sodium--clorure disorders and confirmed by chest X-ray, spirogram, bacteriologic exam of sputum, genetic analysis and positive tests of the pancreatic enzymes and sweat's test. As regards therapeutical solutions, besides antibiotics required in infectious exacerbation, corticotherapy, kinesitherapy and alpha dornasis given in aerosols to improve bronchial mucosa's clearance, also substitutes of pancreatic enzymes and hypercaloric diet are to be considered. In the last two decades, lung transplant appeared to be as an alternative to improve poor prognosis of this disease. Recent studies reported that life expectancy in cystic fibrosis will increase from 28 years in the '90s to 40 years in the next 20 years.",cystic fibrosis
"We describe a late diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) in a multiparous Qatari lady, in whom the main presenting symptoms were those of chronic lung disease. Genetic analysis showed that the patient has a homozygous mutation I1234V in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. This suggests that this mutation has a variable expression of clinical severity and long survival.",cystic fibrosis
"A total of 140 cases of cystic fibrosis in 110 families was identified in Israel during the years 1946--75, and there was reason to suspect inadequate ascertainment. Cystic fibrosis is frequent among the Ashkenazic and Arab populations with an incidence approximating that for Caucasians of European ancestry (1:1,800 to 1:4,000 live births). It is about half as frequent in the Sephardim, rare in the Iraqi or Yemenite Jews and perhaps absent in Iranian Jews. The clinical picture of cystic fibrosis in Israel in all the ethnic groups was found to be the same as elsewhere in the world. In-depth.interviews of 50 families were conducted to assess their understanding of the genetics of the disease and their attitude toward family planning.",cystic fibrosis
"The effects of serum from children with cystic fibrosis and from normal children on the mucus-secreting, ciliated epithelium have been investigated in vitro using explanted tissue from rabbit lung. By optical and scanning electron microscopy, a sequence of structural changes is observed after incubation with cystic fibrosis serum; this sequence does not occur with normal serum. The earliest changes involve swelling of the goblet cells, with subsequent discharge of mucus onto the epithelial surface. This is followed by disruption of the normally rapid and synchronized ciliary activity. Mucus gradually extends over the surface entangling cilia. Finally, some shedding of ciliated cells occurs from the epithelium. These findings suggest that factors in cystic fibrosis serum cause discharge of mucus leading to a disturbance of the normal ciliary activity in the rabbit lung. It is postulated that such changes result in dysfunction of the mucociliary clearance mechanism and that this dysfunction may be a contributory factor to the pathogenesis of lung disease.",cystic fibrosis
"The purpose of this study was to review the published evidence of the effects of cystic fibrosis (CF) on the musculoskeletal system, and their implications on the quality of life of these patients. With increasing longevity of CF patients, musculoskeletal manifestations have become important. Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) are common at all ages in CF patients, and its cause is probably multifactorial. Risk factors contributing to decreased BMC include age of the patient, imbalance between bone accretion and degradation, body mass, nutrition, activity, exposure to glucocorticoid therapy, and gonadal dysfunction. BMC correlates strongly to fat-free mass in CF patients. Lung transplant, while increasing life span, can worsen osteoporosis. Twenty-nine percent of patients are below the 10th percentile for height. Fracture rates are approximately twofold greater in females aged 16 to 32 years and males aged 25 to 34 years. Female patients aged 6 to 16 have a higher than normal fracture rate and a higher rate than their male counterparts. Spinal consequences of osteoporosis include excessive kyphosis in up to 62% of patients. Back pain was noted in 94% of patients. Arthritis in CF, although less common, can be very incapacitating, and it is mainly of three types: CF arthritis, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, and arthritis due to co-existent conditions and drug reactions. The treatment of arthritis is mainly symptomatic in the majority of cases.",cystic fibrosis
"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease primarily affecting the lungs, which could lead to chronic respiratory failure and premature death. CF patients are usually followed in specialized centers, but may present outside of these centers when they seek care for acute pulmonary and/or non-pulmonary complications. The aim of this paper is to provide appropriate knowledge necessary for managing respiratory and non-respiratory emergencies in CF adults. Methods: The review is based on international guidelines, extensive search of the available literature using Pubmed, and experience of the CF reference center at Cochin hospital (Paris, France). Complications occurring after solid organ transplantation (e.g., lung and/or liver) are excluded from this review. Results: Main acute respiratory complications are pulmonary exacerbations, hemoptysis, pneumothorax and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Acute non-respiratory complications include hyponatremic dehydration, acute pancreatitis, acute complications of gallstones, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, symptomatic nephrolithiasis, acute kidney injury, drug intolerances and catheter-related acute complications. Conclusion: This review summarizes acute pulmonary and non-pulmonary complications occurring in adults with CF, focusing on diagnosis and principles of treatment, with the aim of providing a reference that can be used in clinical practice.",cystic fibrosis
"Exercise has much to offer to cystic fibrosis patients. Overcoming the limits of decreased pulmonary function by increasing fitness has a considerable potential to improve patients' quality of life; decreased breathlessness allows greater mobility and participation with peers in social and sporting activities, improves confidence and self-esteem and creates a greater pleasure in life for the individual patient. There are also immediate therapeutic gains and potentially long-term gains with improved survival. Above all, cystic fibrosis patients enjoy and prefer exercise as a therapeutic option to most other forms of therapy.",cystic fibrosis
"The authors reviewed adult cystic fibrosis patients followed in the Pulmonology Unit from 1994-2004 (n=8), five female and three male, aged 20-34 years old (median= 27 years). Patients were diagnosed at 18 months - 31 years old by sweat testing (positive in six patients) and genotyping (four patients homozygous for Delta F508 mutation). Respiratory involvement was characterised by sinusitis and bronchiectasis. Pulmonary involvement was accompanied by functional abnormalities and gas exchange impairment in the majority of the patients. Bronchial tree was colonised permanently in five patients: Pseudomonas aeruginosa in four and Staphilococcus aureus in four (three patients affected by both agents simultaneously). The main causes of exacerbation were respiratory infections and haemoptysis. Non-respiratory involvement was variable. Four patients had digestive involvement (one with hepatic cirrhosis), one had renal failure and only one had a sperm count to document infertility. Four patients had osteopaenia. Treatment included chest physiotherapy, bronchodilators, dornase alfa, mucolytics, digestive enzymes, vitamins, antibiotics and oxygen therapy. At review, one had left follow-up, one had died, one was awaiting lung transplant and the others evidenced no difference in clinical characteristics. In this group of patients the severity of the pulmonary disease was not related to a late diagnosis. It can be explained by the diversity of cystic fibrosis presentation in adults.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is usually diagnosed in early childhood, and patients rarely live beyond the age of 40. We present a case of a 70-year-old woman, in whom cystic fibrosis was diagnosed with the rare mutation, R117C. Cystic fibrosis should therefore also be considered in older patients.",cystic fibrosis
"Objective: To study the clinical and mutation profiles of children with cystic fibrosis in Jammu and Kashmir. Methods: One hundred consecutive patients presenting with one or more phenotypic features suggestive of cystic fibrosis (CF) were screened by quantitative sweat chloride testing. For patients with positive/equivocal test result on two occasions, CFTR gene mutation analysis was done by polymerase chain reaction. Results: Of the 100 patients, 18 (10 females) were diagnosed to have CF at a median age of 10.5 y (IQR 4.75-15.25 y) while the median age at the onset of symptoms was 12 mo (IQR 4-63 mo) with a delay in diagnosis by 102.4±80.5 months. Clinical features at presentation included failure to thrive (94.4%), chronic cough (78%), recurrent pneumonia (61%), persistent pneumonia (11%), and chronic diarrhea (50%). Positive sweat chloride (>60 meq/L) was seen in 14 (14%) patients and 4 (4%) patients had equivocal (40-60 meq/L) value on two different occasions. Mutational analysis done in 15 patients showed DeltaF508 mutation in 20% (3/15) patients in homozygous form and in 13% (2/15) patients in heterozygous form. Intron 19 mutation 3849+10kb C>T was found in 40% (6/15) in heterozygous form. One (6.6%) patient had DeltaF508 and 3849+10kbC>T mutations in compound heterozygous form. Patients with equivocal sweat chloride and 3849+10kbC>T mutation had delayed onset of pulmonary involvement. Conclusion: 3849 +10kbC>T mutation appears to be common in children with cystic fibrosis in Jammu and Kashmir followed by DeltaF508, although the data are quite limited. Although presentation is delayed and sweat chloride is in the equivocal range, severe lung involvement may occur in these patients.",cystic fibrosis
"A simple model of cystic fibrosis (CF) is proposed, based on the apical membrane (ApM) potential. The ApM of epithelial cells is highly permeable to sodium and activation of CFTRs makes it permeable to chloride. Calculated ApM potentials of cells with activated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators (CFTRs) are between the sodium and chloride Nernst values and thus allow rapid absorption of both ions in exocrine glands. In CF patients the potential is near the sodium Nernst value and thus more salt is left in the ducts. Simulation predicts that the sodium driving force increases more than 3.5 times if the ApM permeability for Cl- increases from 5-94% of the sodium permeability. In pancreatic ductal cells basolateral sodium bicarbonate cotransporters (pNBC1) allows influx of bicarbonates with sodium. Bicarbonates are exchanged for intraductal chloride by anion exchanger 1 (AE1) in the ApM. Activated CFTRs let some chloride to leak back to ducts, followed by water that dilutes ductal proteins. Replenished intraductal chloride allows more bicarbonate secretion. In CF patients, pancreatic water and bicarbonate secretion is limited by the intraductal chloride pool.",cystic fibrosis
"Previous clinical studies in patients with cystic fibrosis have demonstrated substantial variability in the symptoms present at diagnosis and in subsequent survival rates. In this study we assessed the association between features present at diagnosis and the clinical course of cystic fibrosis in 89 patients. The 5- and 10-year outcomes for children with cystic fibrosis were better than has been generally appreciated. Overall, two thirds of the patients had either improved or remained at the same level of morbidity 5 years after diagnosis. Children who presented with isolated gastrointestinal symptoms had a good clinical course; some actually improved clinically during the first 5 to 10 years after diagnosis. In contrast, children who presented with respiratory disease frequently had clinical deterioration during the follow-up period. Neither age at presentation nor the initial level of morbidity was significantly related to subsequent outcome. We conclude that clinical features apparent at diagnosis are valuable prognostic indicators in children with cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder that was long considered a terminal illness. Recent genetic discoveries and genomic innovations, however, have transformed the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of this multisystem condition. For affected patients, these breakthroughs offer hope for significantly greater longevity and quality of life and, perhaps, for a future cure. This article reviews empirical research on CF, filling a critical gap in the nursing literature regarding recent findings in the study of CF genetics and their implications for patient teaching, diagnosis, and treatment.",cystic fibrosis
"We report two cases of children followed for many years with an original diagnosis of non-A/non-B hepatitis. One child developed serious cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Long-term observation of the course of their hepatic disease provided the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. These cases demonstrate that cystic fibrosis though rarely presenting with initial hepatic signs, can manifest itself with only long-term hepatic symptoms. We therefore strongly recommend analysis of sweat chloride concentration in cases of hepatic disease of unknown origin.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal monogenic disorder. Life expectancy of CF patients is rising towards a mean of 40 years with advances in all aspects of therapy apart from treating the basic molecular defect. In the twenty three years since the discovery of the gene that causes cystic fibrosis, our knowledge of how mutations in this gene cause the varied pathophysiological manifestations of this disease has increased substantially. This knowledge has led to the possibility of new therapeutic approaches aimed at the basic defect. Apart from gene therapy, several novel compounds have recently been discovered using high-throughput screening which appear promising enough to develop into effective drugs to cure the basic defect. This article will summarize our current knowledge of mutation specific therapy and will focus on orally bioavailable potentiators and correctors and suppressors of premature termination codons. Further development of these drugs will enable treatment of the basic defect in diseases like CF and open the door for treatment of disease according to gene sequencing -- true personalized medicine.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder in Causcasian populations, is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7, which encodes a protein that functions as a chloride channel in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. The clinical manifestations comprise recurrent and chronic bronchopulmonary infections, pancreatic insufficiency, and hidrotic salt depletion. Such complications as diabetes, cirrhosis, and respiratory insufficiency develop, resulting in death in the absence of lung transplantation. Treatment is aggressive and comprehensive from the time of diagnosis. Early and intensive treatment of bacterial colonisation and lung infection is correlated with improved prognosis, and monthly follow-up at a CF Centre is mandatory. Mean survival among CF patients at the Danish CF Centre i Copenhagen is more than 40 years. Clinical trials of gene therapy are under way, but results to date have been disappointing.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis was diagnosed after age 13 in 25 patients. All had an elevated sweat chloride and either a sibling with cystic fibrosis or typical pulmonary infection or digestive symptoms caused by exocrine pancreatic deficiency. Fourteen had long-standing pulmonary or digestive symptoms. In contrast, four of eight patients whose symptoms began after age 13 presented with biliary cirrhosis. Three male patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Opacification of all paranasal sinuses was found in all patients examined radiologically. At diagnosis, pulmonary-function testing showed obstructive changes in 19 patients and sputum cultures showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 15 patients. Delayed menarche in five of seven female patients and infertility in the asymptomatic male patient (two of whom were found to have aspermia) could have led to earlier diagnosis. Teenagers and young adults with long-standing pulmonary or digestive symptoms, unexplained cirrhosis, aspermia, or a sibling with cystic fibrosis should be sweat-tested by pilocarpine iontophoresis.",cystic fibrosis
"Two sisters are described with fatal chronic obstructive lung disease of unknown origin. The lung condition was clinically and histologically indistinguishable from cystic fibrosis and the salivary glands showed pathological changes expected in cystic fibrosis. Neither child had abnormal sweat electrolytes, they had no bowel symptoms, and the pancreas was normal at necropsy.",cystic fibrosis
"Purpose of review: The purpose of this review is to discuss the incidence of cystic fibrosis in the general population, in ethnically diverse populations and specifically in couples needing assisted reproduction caused by male factor subfertility. We review the current understanding of risks for reproductive couples and discuss ideal screening strategies. Recent findings: In ethnically diverse populations, a large difference in clinical sensitivity and birth prevalence exists between the broad racial/ethnic groups examined. Extensive data clearly demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of cystic fibrosis screening. Testing for cystic fibrosis gene mutations is reliable and, with a 26-mutation panel, nearly 90% of possible severe mutations can be detected. To halve the incidence of cystic fibrosis in the community, by offering genetic testing of the fetus if both partners are carrier positive, may also be possible. Summary: Recent guidelines suggest that all couples contemplating pregnancy should be informed of molecular screening for cystic fibrosis carrier status for purposes of genetic counselling. In ethnically diverse populations, ethnic-specific mutations should be included in the mutation panels.",cystic fibrosis
"There is uncertainty about the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis after newborn screening (NBS) for some babies, either because of an intermediate sweat chloride test or inconclusive gene mutation analysis. There is considerable difficulty knowing how best to manage these babies, some of whom will develop cystic fibrosis, but many not. This article offers an ethics-based approach to this clinical dilemma that should be helpful to clinicians managing the baby with an uncertain diagnosis of cystic fibrosis after NBS.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is a lethal genetic disorder whose victims currently have a median life span of approximately 30 years. With this increased life span, new aspects of the disease are identified in patients with cystic fibrosis, including chronic sinusitis. Sinusitis severely affects the quality of life of patients with sinusitis. This article discusses several aspects of sinusitis in patients with cystic fibrosis, including clinical presentation, radiologic findings, and treatment options. By recognizing and treating sinusitis in patients with cystic fibrosis, physicians may improve the quality of life of these patients.",cystic fibrosis
With the early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and the better management of these patients in childhood increasing numbers are surviving to adult life. The main problem requiring continuous medical care in the older cystic fibrosis patient is persisting and often progressive chest disease. For this reason the cystic fibrosis clinic for adolescents and young adults was started in the Western Infirmary in 1975. This paper presents our observations on 13 patients who had attended between 1975 and 1977. Eleven patients are alive and well and have shown no evidence of deterioration over this period. Ten are at school or in regular employment. With optimum medical supervision it is possible to give young adults with cystic fibrosis a worthwhile existence.,cystic fibrosis
"Purpose of review: Nutritional status impacts on the progression of cystic fibrosis. Current guidelines recommend the use of anthropometric indicators to classify nutritional status and identify malnutrition. However, the current nutrition-classification systems are problematic. I summarize these problems and review recent progress in the development of evidence-based anthropometric criteria for classifying nutritional status in cystic fibrosis patients. Recent findings: Percentage of ideal body weight as a malnutrition index is flawed. In children with cystic fibrosis, this index underestimates the severity of underweight in short patients and overestimates it in tall patients. In adults with cystic fibrosis, percentage of ideal body weight based on the Metropolitan Life Insurance reference weights for medium/large frames overestimates the severity of underweight. Body-mass-index percentile for children and body mass index for adults as underweight indices have been proven to be valid. Strong associations between body mass index and lung function are also observed, but cutoff values to maintain a desirable level of lung function can vary. Summary: Body mass index should replace the use of percentage of ideal body weight for classifying underweight in cystic fibrosis patients. More research is needed to identify appropriate indicators to classify short stature in children with cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"As a testimony to advances in patient care, more individuals with cystic fibrosis are surviving into their adult years than ever before. The clinical epidemiology of this complex multi-organ disease is evolving and has changed dramatically over the past two to three decades. This article discusses the emergence of chronic disease-related co-morbidities such as CF-related diabetes, chronic kidney disease, bone disease, arthropathy, and depression. It also provides an overview of the many challenges confronted by adult CF care providers.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is a chronic, multisystem genetic disease with a wide variability in clinical severity. In recent years, advances in therapy have led to improved patient survival into adulthood. New treatments are rapidly being developed and require evaluation to determine their efficacy. The measurement of health-related quality of life in cystic fibrosis provides additional information about the impact of this disease that cannot be obtained by physiological tests such as pulmonary function. An instrument to measure health-related quality of life is especially useful as an outcome measure for clinical trials. To date, only a few general quality-of-life (QOL) measures have been used in people with cystic fibrosis. There has been some demonstration of validity in 2 measures (the Quality of Well-Being Scale and the Functional Status Index) but the responsiveness of these instruments in this population has not been established. A cystic fibrosis-specific QOL instrument would be valuable as an outcome measure because of its potential for increased responsiveness, but no published measures exist as yet.",cystic fibrosis
"Sweat-chloride levels at the time of diagnosis have been reviewed from 708 patients with cystic fibrosis. Sixty-one patients, shown to be non-steatorrheic, were found to have significantly lower levels than 647 patients with severe pancreatic insufficiency. Although patients who retain pancreatic function are known to have less severe pulmonary involvement and a better overall prognosis (5), we were unable to show any correlation of sweat-chloride levels at diagnosis with pulmonary function, current age or Shwachman clinical score which might be of prognostic value.",cystic fibrosis
"Because the lifespan of patients with cystic fibrosis is now longer, both pediatricians and adult care physicians are involved in the health care strategy. Respiratory manifestations occur due to bronchial dilatation and chronic bronchial infection, mainly due to Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas. Episodes of adult infection are frequent and death usually results from respiratory failure. Characteristically, the disease also involves exocrine pancreas insufficiency. Other intestinal tract manifestations include meconial ileus and liver disease which may reach the stage of biliary cirrhosis. Nutritional disorders are frequent. Clinically there are respiratory and digestive tract disorders, pansinusitis and frequent nasal polyposis, sometimes associated with diabetes mellitus or joint pain. Male sterility results from bilateral agenesia of the vas deferens and in the female, fertility is decreased although pregnancy is possible. Clinical presentation suggests the diagnosis which is confirmed by a sweat test and genetic analysis. Care should be provided by a centre specialized in cystic fibrosis. The main treatments rely on respiratory physical therapy, antibiotics and gastroprotected pancrease extracts.",cystic fibrosis
"Stool energy losses and the sources of energy within the stool were determined in 20 healthy controls and 20 patients with cystic fibrosis while on their habitual pancreatic enzyme replacement treatment. Stool energy losses were equivalent to 3.5% of gross energy intake in healthy children (range 1.3-5.8%). Despite a comparable gross energy intake, stool energy losses were three times greater in patients with cystic fibrosis than controls averaging 10.6% of gross energy intake (range 4.9-19.7%). Stool lipid could account for only 29% and 41% of the energy within the stool in controls and patients with cystic fibrosis respectively and was poorly related to stool energy. Approximately 30% of the energy within the stool could be attributable to colonic bacteria in both the healthy children and patients with cystic fibrosis. These results suggest that stool energy losses in healthy children are relatively modest but that even when patients with cystic fibrosis are symptomatically well controlled on pancreatic enzyme replacement, raised stool energy losses may continue to contribute towards an energy deficit sufficient to limit growth in cystic fibrosis. As the energy content per gram wet weight remains relatively constant (8 kJ/g), stool energy losses may be estimated from simple measurements of stool wet weight.",cystic fibrosis
"The prevalence of hyponutrition in cystic fibrosis is high although it may vary according to the different studies. Detection of hyponutrition should be done by combining different methods, depending on their availability. However, the simplest and most validated criterion is to measure at each visit the weight (and height in children) in order to calculate the body mass index and categorizing hyponutrition according to absolute criteria: in adults < 18.5 kg/m(2), and in children as percentiles of the body mass index. Worsening of the nutritional status is directly related with the decrease in lung function parameters and it has been proposed as a morbidity (and even mortality) predictive factor in people with cystic fibrosis, independently of the level of pulmonary dysfunction. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is present is approximately 70-90% of the patients with cystic fibrosis and the genotype-phenotype correlation is high. Most of the patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency tolerate a high-fat diet provided that they are treated with pancreatic enzymes at appropriate doses. The prevalence of diabetes increases with age, reaching up 40% of the cases in patients older than 30 years. Clinical liver involvement is less prevalent (it approximately affects 1/3 of the patients). Other intestinal complications such as meconial ileus, gastroesophageal reflux, obstruction of the distal intestine, or fibrosing colon disease may also condition malnourishment. In patients with cystic fibrosis, a usual high-fat diet providing 120%-150% of the recommended calories is advised. If the nutritional goals are not achieved or maintained with diet modifications, artificial supplements may be added, although the recommendation for their use has not been endorsed by solid scientific evidences. The most frequently used preparations usually are polymeric or hypercaloric. The indications for enteral (through a tube, especially gastrostomy) or parenteral nutritional support are similar to those used in other pathologies. Dietary and nutritional control should be included in a multidisciplinary program allowing the improvement of the functional capacity and the quality of life and reducing, at least from a theoretical viewpoint, the morbimortality associated to malnourishment in these patients.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis--a hereditary disease with chronic pulmonary infections and malnutrition--demands on intensive, troublesome, costly and time-consuming therapy. Only a few years ago nearly all CF-patients died in childhood, but today most of them are expected to reach adulthood. All Swedish CF-patients are registered centrally. This registry has been used for demographic studies, and all the CF-families in the registry have got enquiries about sociomedical conditions. In the years 1968-1977 the number of CF-patients has increased from 116 to 200 and median survival age from 7.5 to 16.0 years. The incidence is estimated to 1:2,200 - 1:4,500. The medical care has been intensified and follows the guidelines of the ""Swedish CF-board"". The clinical condition of the patients has improved in the period. The most striking social aspects are the long time spent on treatment (mean: 18, maximum: greater than 50 hours/week) and the little help that is given by physiotherapists or community paid helps. The parents have to do all the work themselves! Even if the families receive several specific benefits the economical burden is heavy and strikes very unevenly. School results of CF-children are good. The main wishes from CF-parents are: intensive research to find the basic defect, uniform support to CF-families throughout the country, much information to be given especially to physicians.",cystic fibrosis
"The care of the young adult with cystic fibrosis is complex, requiring a multidisciplinary input from different carers. Communication with and education of patients covers many areas; topics may include medical and personal problems, transplantation, survival, current scientific breakthroughs and the future. Communicating in these areas with knowledgeable young adults requires skill, tact and self-education upon the part of the cystic fibrosis team.",cystic fibrosis
"Clinical trials of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis suggest that current levels of gene transfer efficiency are probably too low to result in clinical benefit, largely as a result of the barriers faced by gene transfer vectors within the airways. The respiratory epithelium has evolved a complex series of extracellular barriers (mucus, lack of receptors, immune surveillance, etc.) aimed at preventing penetration of lumenally delivered materials, including gene therapy vectors. In addition, once in the cell, further hurdles have to be overcome, including DNA degradation, nuclear import and the ability to maintain long-term transgene expression. Strategies to overcome these barriers will be addressed in this review and include the use of: (i) clinically relevant adjuncts to overcome the extra- and intracellular barriers; (ii) less-conventional delivery routes, such as intravenous or in utero administration; (iii) more efficient non-viral vectors and 'stealth' viruses which can be re-administered; and (iv) new approaches to prolong transgene expression by means of alternative promoters or integrating vectors. These advances have the potential to improve the efficiency of gene delivery to the airway epithelium, thus making gene therapy a more realistic option for cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
Recently significantly raised serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were demonstrated in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and in their parents and some siblings; thereupon the determination of AFP was recommended for detecting heterozygote carriers of the CF-gene. These results could not be confirmed by our own investigations also using a radioimmunassay.,cystic fibrosis
"Scoring systems for evaluation of the degree of severity in patients with cystic fibrosis are critically evaluated. Cross-sectional comparison of Shwachman's score, Cooperman's score, Taussig-NIH score, Bernese score and Huang score reveals that advantages and disadvantages of each score exist. In early days used as a marker of disease progression, later on integrated in research studies for patients survival, the scoring systems loose their power due to the possibility of computerized data storage of unlimited variables. Computerized networking allows immediate access to all measured data of an individual or of groups of patients with detailed criteria. Analysis of such data are less vulnerable for mistakes than individually scored patients data; scoring systems in cystic fibrosis will probably become an historical measure.",cystic fibrosis
"Resting energy expenditure (REE) is increased in patients with cystic fibrosis, a consequence of the work of breathing and not related to the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene. CF patients compensate, however, with reduced energy expenditure for activity and thermogenesis, thereby maintaining total energy expenditure (TEE) equivalent to that of healthy peers.",cystic fibrosis
"We describe a case of an adult patient, whom sarcoidosis was diagnosed at first and cystic fibrosis was also discovered 2 years later on. Cystic fibrosis and sarcoidosis are uncommon diseases that only rarely occur together. On the other hand, the coincidence of sarcoidosis and cystic fibrosis is possible, and, moreover, one of the diseases can remain undiagnosed long time. Relationship between sarcoidosis and cystic fibrosis seems not to be probable, in accordance with recent medical reports, and the coincidence of both conditions appears as sporadic.",cystic fibrosis
"The incidence of cystic fibrosis in Ontario, Canada has been determined from clinical data, from the cystic fibrosis database of the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, and from population statistics in the Province of Ontario. The survey included 420 confirmed cases of cystic fibrosis born during the period 1966-1980. The mean incidence during this period was one in 2,927. In the last 5-year period, a decline was noted in incidence that may have reflected in part the effectiveness of early diagnosis and genetic counseling in affected families. During the period of the survey, over 60% of cases were diagnosed within the first year of life, 74% by age 2 years, and 90% by age 5 years. Clinical diagnosis in the first year of life was more common in males (65%) than in females (54%), a consistent finding during the period of the survey. The incidence of meconium ileus was 15.7% of ascertained cases of cystic fibrosis, with similar incidences in males (16.4%) and females (14.4%). Although survival has not been the subject of this survey, mortality in the neonatal period was significantly higher in males than in females with cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that arises due to mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator gene, which encodes for a protein responsible for ion transport out of epithelial cells. This leads to a disruption in transepithelial Cl-, Na + and HCO3- ion transport and the subsequent dehydration of the airway epithelium, resulting in infection, inflammation and development of fibrotic tissue. Unlike in CF, fibrosis in other lung diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has been well characterised. One of the driving forces behind fibrosis is Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a process where epithelial cells lose epithelial proteins including E-Cadherin, which is responsible for tight junctions. The cell moves to a more mesenchymal phenotype as it gains mesenchymal markers such as N-Cadherin (providing the cells with migration potential), Vimentin and Fibronectin (proteins excreted to help form the extracellular matrix), and the fibroblast proliferation transcription factors Snail, Slug and Twist. This review paper explores the EMT process in a range of lung diseases, details the common links that these have to cystic fibrosis, and explores how understanding EMT in cystic fibrosis may open up novel methods of treating patients with cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) was distinguished from celiac disease in 1938. Then, it was a pathologic diagnosis, life expectancy was approximately 6 months, and the autosomal recessive disease was believed to arise from abnormal mucus plugging exocrine ducts. Death often occurred from lung infection. Discovery of the sweat electrolyte defect in 1953 and standardization of the sweat test in 1959 allowed identification of milder cases, and CF was no longer considered only a disorder of mucus. In 1955, establishment of centers with programs of aggressive, comprehensive care initiated striking improvement in longevity. The pillars of care established then (attention to nutrition, airway clearance, treatment of lung infection) remain today. In 1983, chloride transport was identified as the basic physiologic CF defect, accompanied by increased sodium reabsorption. In 1980, we learned that inflammation contributes independently to lung disease and constitutes an independent therapeutic target. In 1989, the discovery of the CF gene demonstrated the basic defect to be in a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. This afforded new diagnostic tests, opportunities for research, and prospects for using the gene as therapy. Since then, substantial advances in basic and clinical research catalyzed therapeutic improvements: median survival age now exceeds 30 years. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation center network provides not only opportunity to conduct clinical trials but also means to disseminate new therapies. In the future, treatments directed at the basic defect can be expected, with concomitant improvements in morbidity and mortality.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most frequent genetic disorder occurring in Caucasian, followed to preterm death. Clinical diagnosis of CF is set in infant or early childhood. Late diagnosis of CF is most often caused by non-typical course of the disease, rarely by misdiagnosis and not taken CF into account in differential diagnosis. In this paper we present two cases of misdiagnosis lung and digestive symptoms, treated as asthma bronchiale.",cystic fibrosis
"Twenty-six adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) were administered the Tennessee Self Concept Scale. The mean overall scores placed the CF patients at the 30th percentile of a normative adolescent population. Eighty-five percent were at appropriate school grade level, 69% participated in physical education classes, and 81% had future plans for college and/or a career. Total Life Event scores of CF adolescents were not significantly different from the normal adolescent population. However, in 22 CF adolescents evaluated with a modified National Institute of Health Scoring System, negative Life Event scores were higher in 10 adolescents with moderate to severely impaired health status than in 12 with lesser impairment. This relationship was not modified by other psychosocial variables.",cystic fibrosis
"Diabetes mellitus in cystic fibrosis (CF-DM) is increasingly prevalent with age, develops insidiously and is characterized by insulinopenia, normal insulin sensitivity, increased insulin clearance rate and concomitant exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Since CF-DM impairs overall CF clinical status, including lung function, and may result in late diabetic complications, the condition should be screened for by annual oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) from the age of 10 years, and be treated with insulin from the time of diagnosis of CF-DM.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the common life limiting inherited diseases in Caucasian population. Recent reports suggest that the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in Indian children is missed or delayed due to low index of suspicion. The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is suspected by the typical clinical features and should be confirmed by doing sweat chloride estimation. If sweat test is not available, ancillary tests including blood electrolyte and acid base balance, airway microbiology, tests to identify pancreatic insufficiency and semen analysis for obstructive azoospermia in post pubertal boys should be carried out. Positive results of these tests make the suspicion very strong. A strongly suspected case should be treated as cystic fibrosis, but for giving a diagnosis of CF, sweat test should be done from the nearest centre where it is available. In the presence of typical clinical features with borderline sweat chloride values sweat test should be repeated 2-3 times and the child should be investigated for alternative diagnosis. In the absence of alternative diagnosis with consistently high or borderline sweat chloride values an attempt should be made to get tests for mutations.",cystic fibrosis
"Aims: To determine the status of cystic fibrosis patients, their mode of diagnosis and source of medical care in New Zealand. Methods: A database was established in 1988 to record clinical information on individuals with cystic fibrosis in New Zealand. Three hundred and two cystic fibrosis patients were identified and clinical information on 248 obtained. Results: Thirty five per cent of patients at diagnosis had gastrointestinal and pulmonary and 33% had gastrointestinal symptoms alone. Ninety three infants were diagnosed after a positive screening test and confirmatory sweat test. The mean age at diagnosis overall was 1.8 years, while 61% of children were diagnosed before one year of age. 74.2% of patients were said to be pancreatic insufficient, 4% pancreatic sufficient and in 22% the results were unavailable or unknown. Medical care was provided by 28 sources comprising paediatricians, physicians or combined clinics. One cystic fibrosis clinic cared for more than 40 patients. Sixty-one per cent of cystic fibrosis subjects were colonised with Staphylococcus aureus at some time, and 44% were reported to be colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conclusions: Common clinical features of cystic fibrosis have been characterised for New Zealand patients. It is unknown to what extent the clinical features of the disease and source of medical care in New Zealand are responsible for previously reported survival for the condition but it is planned to examine serial measurements of growth, nutrition, pulmonary function and survival and it is hoped that these measurements will be the subject of a further report.",cystic fibrosis
"Objective: To review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus (CFRD). Methods: We performed a MEDLINE search of the literature, using the search terms ""cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, ""CFRD,"" and ""cystic fibrosis and diabetes,"" to identify pertinent articles available in English. Results: In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), CFRD is a major cause for an accelerated decline in health. It is the result of multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms, including destruction of pancreatic islet cells, impaired hepatic response to the antigluconeogenic effects of insulin, and impaired insulin sensitivity. Nutritional management and adequate caloric intake are paramount to successful management of CF. Although insulin remains the standard of care for treating CFRD in conjunction with fasting hyperglycemia, a small but growing body of literature supports the use of oral therapies. In this article, we discuss the benefits of and possible adverse reactions to the various classes of oral and injectable agents used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, with special attention to the population of patients with CF. Conclusion: Orally administered agents can have a role in the treatment of CFRD. Further study is needed to determine the optimal combination of therapeutic modalities for CFRD.",cystic fibrosis
"Purpose of review: Cystic fibrosis (CF) has received a lot of attention in the past few years because of increased longevity and the emergence of ground-breaking new drugs targeting the molecular and cellular defects, making a huge clinical difference, and - not incidentally - carrying massive price tags. The prices of these new drugs make the question of overall costs of CF care highly relevant. Recent findings: This article reviews recent developments in CF science and treatment, and highlights areas that contribute to costs of CF care, emphasizing how these costs have increased. Summary: This article should help the pediatrician stay abreast of high points of CF care, with an awareness of the factors that wield the biggest influence on overall costs, to patients, families and the US healthcare system.",cystic fibrosis
"A case of a specialist senior non-commissioned officer with cystic fibrosis (CF) is described. Partial expression of the CF trait is well known and sporadic cases are detected from time to time at recruitment, during recruit training and service. Respiratory symptoms may be mis-diagnosed as self-limiting asthma until a sweat chloride or other specific test for CF is performed.",cystic fibrosis
"Respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis are both local and systemic. The local symptoms include cough, sputum, wheezing, haemoptysis and breathlessness, while systemic symptoms of malaise and fever occur with pulmonary infection. There are also interactions between respiratory and gastrointestinal systems in producing symptoms of malaise and weakness and these also contribute to the secondary psychological and social problems that a number of patients with cystic fibrosis experience. These local respiratory symptoms can be attributed in part to lung damage, but are also a manifestation of the CF defect itself. Similarly, lung damage, allergy, haemodynamic and nutritional changes all contribute to the symptom of breathlessness. Further improvement in symptoms in the future will come not only from limiting the lung damage but also from therapy aimed at reversing the CF defect itself.",cystic fibrosis
In vitro studies have suggested a potential role for calcium channel blockers in manipulating the basic ionic defect of cystic fibrosis. In 17 adult patients with cystic fibrosis nicardipine was administered either intravenously or topically using iontophoresis or occlusive dressings. Sweat tests were performed before and after drug administration and examined using two way analysis of variance. No statistically significant difference was observed. We conclude that nicardipine used in vivo does not exert the easily demonstrable effect on the chloride ion defect that has been observed with other agents in vitro.,cystic fibrosis
"Urinary tract stones are a common problem in a general population but increasingly so in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients as survival improves. Mechanisms of stone formation are discussed, particularly those unique to CF patients. Modalities of treatment and the decision making process in this choice is outlined as well as possible future preventative strategies.",cystic fibrosis
We report 3 cases where the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) was either confirmed or refuted by studies of chloride secretion in intestinal mucosal biopsies. In one case a heterozygous state was indicated and later confirmed by gene probe studies. The technique clearly distinguishes between CF and control patients and can provide a rapid diagnosis even in the neonatal period.,cystic fibrosis
"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, responsible for the cystic fibrosis phenotype when both alleles are mutated, was cloned and sequenced in 1989. Since then, more than 400 mutations have been reported in the gene, although most of these are rare. We have systematically analysed the entire coding sequence of the CFTR gene in a cohort of patients originating from the West of France (Caen, Brest and Nantes). More than 450 CF children, 914 chromosomes in all, have been exhaustively studied in the three centers. We have been able to characterize more than 90% of the mutations, respectively 93.5%, 99% and 95.8%. Despite the large diversity in the CFTR mutations occurring in CF patients from this area, these results can help to improve genetic counselling, prenatal diagnosis as well as our understanding of the molecular basis of the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"We examine critically the biochemical methods capable of detecting and monitoring the end-organ disease processes in patients with cystic fibrosis. Although the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is never justified on the basis of the sweat salt test alone, the original filter-paper technic (Gibson-Cooke, Pediatrics 23:545-549, 1959) for determining Na+ and Cl- concentrations in sweat remains the most discriminating method. We discuss the contributions for neonatal screening of the so-called cystic fibrosis protein, associated decreased enzymic activities in the homo- and heterozygous state, and immunoreactive trypsin. Because evidence of either intestinal malabsorption or a pancreatic lesion must be sought, we review the use and interpretation of some tests of pancreatic dysfunction (meconium albumin, duodenal juice components, serum pancreatic isoamylase, and trypsinogen), both in establishing and in confirming the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Comprehensive newborn screening for cystic fibrosis has occurred for more than 25 years in some regions and the results of randomised controlled trials reporting the outcomes have been published. Testing protocols for CF have recently been reviewed and the sensitivity and specificity of these protocols are high. In spite of this, many remain sceptical in respect of the advantages conferred by newborn screening for CF. Every study of newborn screening has shown that diagnosis occurs at a significantly younger age. While this alone is sufficient to justify newborn screening, the clinical course of those diagnosed via newborn screening indicates that many additional advantages accrue. These include a decreased morbidity and mortality in early life, facilitation of better growth and prevention of vitamin deficiency in early infancy, as well as some indication of an advantage in terms of pulmonary status later in life. This review summarises the arguments in favour of newborn screening for CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal monogenic disorder. Life expectancy is rising towards a mean of 40 years, with advances in all aspects of therapy apart from treating the basic defect. Since the discovery of the gene that causes CF, our knowledge of how mutations in this gene cause the varied pathophysiological manifestations of this disease has increased substantially. Areas covered: This paper discusses the complexities of treatment in CF and the development of therapeutic approaches aimed at the different classes of basic mutation. Apart from gene therapy, several novel compounds have recently been discovered using high-throughput screening, which appear promising enough to develop effective drugs to cure the basic defect. This paper summarizes our current knowledge of gene and mutation-specific therapy and focuses on orally bioavailable potentiators and correctors, particularly suppressors of premature termination codons, including preclinical model systems and clinical trials in CF. Expert opinion: The further development of these drugs will enable treatment of the basic defect in diseases such as CF, and open the door for treatment of disease according to gene sequencing: true personalized medicine.",cystic fibrosis
"Since the discovery of the gene associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), there have been considerable advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of disease. Although we are identifying patients with milder manifestations of disease, there are a number of patients who are not diagnosed until adulthood. There is a movement for earlier intervention, so there is increasing interest in making the diagnosis of CF in the asymptomatic patient. With more sophisticated testing, we are able to make the diagnosis in the newborn or even the fetus. In this report, we discuss our current approach to making a diagnosis of CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Objective: A survey was conducted to estimate how many adult patients with cystic fibrosis who receive care at centers accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) also have biological children with the disease. Methods: A six-item questionnaire was sent to 144 CFF-accredited care centers and satellites. After one month, a reminder e-mail was sent to the nonresponding centers. Results: A total of 119 responses were received. Forty (34%) of the responding centers reported having at least one and as many as five patients with cystic fibrosis who also had biological children with the disease. A total of 66 such patients were identified. Of these, 39 (59%) were newly diagnosed themselves as a consequence of prenatal testing or a child's diagnosis. Conclusion: Despite some study limitations, these findings show that a number of people with cystic fibrosis are having children who also have the disease. Moreover, many parents are learning that they have cystic fibrosis only after their child is diagnosed. Further research is needed to better estimate both the proportion of adults with cystic fibrosis who are having children with the disease and the proportion late-diagnosed, as well as to explore the psychosocial needs of these patients and their children. Keywords: cystic fibrosis, cystic fibrosis research, family planning, genetic testing, carrier testing, newborn screening.",cystic fibrosis
"With a comprehensive team approach and attention to early intervention, most infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) born in the 1990s will reach and contribute successfully to adult life. Our perception of CF has evolved from a lethal disease in childhood to a chronic disorder with increased mortality in adulthood. This article examines some of the issues involved in ensuring that children with CF achieve these goals, with special emphasis on the maintenance of health and the prevention of disease progression.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis occurs in 1 in 2000 children and the majority now reach adulthood. The disease is a complex multisystem disorder which is likely to challenge anaesthetists with increasing frequency. In this review the presentation and genetics of the disease are briefly described, followed by a detailed account of the pathophysiology relevant to anaesthesia. The pre-operative assessment and conduct of anaesthesia are discussed and some suggestions made regarding management.",cystic fibrosis
"Once considered a childhood disease, cystic fibrosis is now also a disease of adults. Increased longevity has resulted in the aging of the cystic fibrosis population. The consequent age-related medical problems among adults with cystic fibrosis have increased medical care needs. These needs are being met by a growing number of non-pediatric pulmonologists and other non-pediatric specialists. The objective of this review was to summarize the current knowledge about diagnosis and treatment in adult cystic fibrosis. In most cases, the diagnosis is suggested by manifestations of chronic sinopulmonary disease and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The diagnosis is confirmed by a positive sweat test result. Adult patients may, however, present pancreatic sufficiency and atypical clinical features, sometimes in combination with normal or borderline sweat test results. In such cases, identifying cystic fibrosis mutations and measuring nasal potential difference can have diagnostic utility. The standard therapeutic approach to pulmonary disease includes the use of antibiotics, airway clearance, exercise, mucolytics, bronchodilators, oxygen therapy, anti-inflammatory agents and nutritional support. Appropriate application of these therapies results in most cystic fibrosis patients surviving into adulthood with an acceptable quality of life.",cystic fibrosis
"The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) is often delayed because of the nonspecificity of a wide variety of clinical symptoms at disease onset. Newborn screening for CF has been advocated to reduce delays in diagnosis, facilitating preventive care for early respiratory and nutritional involvement. According to American and European consensus and experience of existing programs, a Swiss Nationwide Cystic Fibrosis Newborn Screening Program started in January 2011. Screening strategy combines two steps: an immunoreactive trypsinogen assay and DNA mutation analysis in dried blood samples at day 4 (Guthrie cards).",cystic fibrosis
"The life expectancy for a child with Cystic Fibrosis has steadily increased over the past few decades from an average of 8 years in 1970 to 29.5 years in 1998. Nurses who care for this special population need to be open to discussions about the quality of life of these individuals, including sexuality, body image, and self-esteem. Specific information concerning expected body image, fertility, and safe-sex practices is essential. Males will want to know about their reproductive choices, and females will need to have counseling about the decision to become pregnant, including the genetic implications for both themselves and the unborn child.",cystic fibrosis
"Background: The frequency of cystic fibrosis is unknown in Tunisia, regarding the limited number of reported surveys and patients. Aim: to determine the clinical characteristics, outcome and genetic data of cystic fibrosis in Tunisian pediatric patients. Methods: Cases of cystic fibrosis managed at pediatric departments of Tunis, during 15 years (1997-2012), were reviewed. Results: 33 children (23 males and 10 females) were enrolled. The Onset was within the first year of life in 26 patients. Revealing symptoms were the following: recurrent bronchopneumonia (28 cases), chronic diarrhea (17 cases), hepatomegaly (6 cases), malnutrition (15 cases), pseudo Bartter syndrome (3 cases), edemaanemia- hypoprotidemia (4 cases) and meconium ileus (4 cases). The diagnosis was confirmed by sweat test and genotypic data, the F508 del was the most frequent mutation (17 cases). Several complications had occurred during follow-up: chronic pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (15 cases), chronic respiratory failure (14 cases), recurrent hemoptysis (2 cases), pleural effusion (3 cases) and cirrhosis (2 cases). Ten patients died at a mean age of 7 years. One patient had pulmonary transplantation. Prenatal diagnosis was performed in 9 families. Conclusion: In Tunisia, cystic fibrosis is not exceptional, but its diagnosis is delayed. Our survey is characterized by more severe earliest forms, difficult and insufficient therapeutic management. A Better medical awareness and a national action plan are needed.",cystic fibrosis
"Current knowledge of reproductive duct function in both male and female cystic fibrosis patients is reviewed. Almost all male patients are sterile because of azoospermia. The mechanistic basis of the obstructive defect leading to pre- and post-natal destruction of selected portions of the sperm-conducting network remains unknown. Female cystic fibrosis patients are fertile. Pulmonary status appears to be the most important factor in determining pregnancy outcome. In contrast to earlier concerns about the normality of breast milk, breast milk composition of cystic fibrosis mothers is normal, and they can successfully breast feed their infants.",cystic fibrosis
"Lung transplantation currently stands as the only therapeutic option that carries the potential to restore patients with advanced cystic fibrosis to a more normal state of health. Nonetheless, the procedure carries significant risk and median survival following transplantation is only 5 years. This article discusses the currently achievable outcomes and the common short-comings of transplantation. Strategies to optimize outcomes through appropriate patient selection, use of living donors, and novel research initiatives are discussed.",cystic fibrosis
"The most recent advances about cystic fibrosis genetics are revised. Their clinical applications are reviewed: prenatal diagnosis, heterozygote screening, genotype and phenotype correlation, gene therapy.",cystic fibrosis
"Background: Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common bacterial infection in adults with cystic fibrosis and frequently develops resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics, it has not been determined whether patients with multiple antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa have worse clinical outcomes than patients with more susceptible strains. Objectives: This study assessed the impact of multiply-resistant P. aeruginosa on lung function, hospitalizations, antibiotic use, lung transplantation and survival in adults with cystic fibrosis. Methods: In a cohort study at a university-based adult cystic fibrosis program, 75 consecutive adult cystic fibrosis patients who had P. aeruginosa isolated from sputum cultures were studied over a 4-year period. Outcomes included decline in FEV1, clinic visits, hospitalizations, courses and days of intravenous antibiotics, and lung transplantation. Multiple linear and Poisson regression for repeated measures were used to assess the outcomes. Results: In comparison to patients with susceptible strains, patients with resistant P. aeruginosa had more severe baseline lung disease, more rapid decline in FEV1 (160 ml/year, p = 0.003) and were significantly more likely to undergo lung transplantation (17.6 vs. 0%, p = 0.005). Conclusions: Infection with multiple-antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa is associated with accelerated progression of cystic fibrosis, and has important implications for infection control strategies, antibiotic use and lung transplantation.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disorder, is the most common genetic disease of Caucasians. One in 25 Caucasians are carriers of the gene. The gene is found far less commonly in other races. There are over 230 different alleles of the gene, located on the 7th chromosome. The gene encodes for a membrane protein that functions as an ion channel. The survival of cystic fibrosis patients has been gradually increasing, with a mean survival in 1990 of 28 years. If the current trend of improved survival continues, it is estimated that half of cystic fibrosis patients will be over 18 years old by 1996. Disease is found in many organs including the lungs, sinuses, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, hepatobiliary system, sweat glands and reproductive tract. The majority of patients die of pulmonary disease. The airways become chronically colonized with bacteria that cannot be eradicated, leading to bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and finally, pulmonary fibrosis with respiratory failure. The pulmonary disease may be complicated by massive hemoptysis and pneumothorax. Patient survival rates have increased because of antibiotic therapy and improved nutrition with pancreatic enzyme replacements. New treatments for the pulmonary disease are under clinical trial and include antiproteases, amiloride, a sodium channel blocker, and DNase. The insertion of the normal cystic fibrosis allele into an animal model using a modified adenovirus with effective transcription suggests that gene therapy may be possible in the future, but safety and technical problems have to be addressed.",cystic fibrosis
"There has been a dramatic increase in the life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) over the last 20 years. CF used to be fatal in childhood but now, over a third of the patients are adults. The reasons for improved survival are multi-factorial. The disease affects most systems of the body although the majority of morbidity and mortality is due to lung disease. As in any life-threatening disease, in addition to medical issues, there are many psychosocial and spiritual issues, which need attention. Transition from paediatric to adult care needs to be handled very sensitively. Arranging a balanced and reliable system of care - out-patient, in-patient and home care - is essential to ensure the patient's survival and quality of life is as good as possible.",cystic fibrosis
By ultrasound examination of high risk pregnancies for cystic fibrosis in some cases echogenic areas and dilated bowels could be demonstrated. These signs could be detected in 75% of those cases where biochemical assay of the amniotic fluid proved the fetus to be affected with cystic fibrosis. Having got these results authors started to look for these signs during the screening of normal pregnancies. Out of 22 thousand screened pregnancies 28 amniocenteses have been performed because of the ultrasound finding and in 18 cases the low microvillar enzyme activity also predicted cystic fibrosis.,cystic fibrosis
"Purpose: To provide a review of the status of biomarkers in cystic fibrosis drug development, including regulatory definitions and considerations, a summary of biomarkers in current use with supportive data, current gaps, and future needs. Methods: Biomarkers are considered across several areas of CF drug development, including cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulation, infection, and inflammation. Results: Sweat chloride, nasal potential difference, and intestinal current measurements have been standardized and examined in the context of multicenter trials to quantify CFTR function. Detection and quantification of pathogenic bacteria in CF respiratory cultures (e.g.: Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are commonly used in early phase antimicrobial clinical trials, and to monitor safety of therapeutic interventions. Sputum (e.g.: neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, calprotectin) and blood biomarkers (e.g.: C reactive protein, calprotectin, serum amyloid A) have had variable success in detecting response to inflammatory treatments. Conclusions: Biomarkers are used throughout the drug development process in CF, and many have been used in early phase clinical trials to provide proof of concept, detect drug bioactivity, and inform dosing for later-phase studies. Advances in the precision of current biomarkers, and the identification of new biomarkers with 'omics-based technologies, are needed to accelerate CF drug development.",cystic fibrosis
Pneumothorax is a serious but common complication in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). It has adverse prognostic implications as well as associations with subsequent reduction in lung function and significant risk of recurrence. Management dilemmas frequently occur that are beyond current guidelines. We review the evidence and highlight management difficulties in pneumothoraces in CF.,cystic fibrosis
"A standardized questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge about cystic fibrosis (CF) in 20 parents of our patients with CF. 15 questions about genetics, symptoms and treatment were asked, with each item scored as correct or incorrect. Parents correctly answered an average of 9.5 of the 15 questions. The knowledge test demonstrated good internal consistency (alpha = 0.77). An examination of separate knowledge domains indicated that parents were almost equally knowledged about treatment (M = 63% of the items correct) and symptoms (M = 62%) but less about genetics and reproduction (M = 53%). Internal consistency however amounted to alpha = 0.34 in treatment, alpha = 0.45 in symptoms and alpha = 0.67 in genetics. This study showed that knowledge of disease in parents of our CF-patients was generally good. However there were same deficits in the field of treatment.",cystic fibrosis
"A cystic fibrosis (CF) clinic for adults was established in 1977. We have reviewed the data on 164 patients who attended between 1977 and 1989. Twenty four patients had died, 11 being over 20 years of age at the time of death. Of the 140 patients still alive, 61% were male and 53% were aged over 20 years. Only 55% were diagnosed by one year and 88% by ten years. Almost all patients had respiratory symptoms and sputum culture yielded pseudomonas species in 69%. Other respiratory problems included major haemoptysis and pneumothorax, each in 10%. We found a wide range of respiratory impairment among older patients. Among 33 patients aged over 23 years, the mean (+/-S.D.) percent predicted FEV1 and FVC were 53.3% (+/- 18%) and 71.4 (+/- 20%) respectively. Mean weight in this group was 92.5% (+/- 14) of predicted. Malabsorption occurred in most patients and meconium ileus equivalent occurred in 34%. Other complications were clinical hepatomegaly (16%), diabetes mellitus (9%) and arthropathy (20%). Most patients were taking continuous antibiotics by mouth (89%) and by nebuliser (48%), beta-2 agonists by inhaler (57%) and oral steroids (29%). Almost all were taking multivitamins, pancreatic replacement therapy and multiple nutritional supplements. The number of CF ""bed days"" grew 12 fold since 1979 and the mean stay in hospital was double the hospital mean. The economic impact was such that over 1/4 of the annual hospital antibiotic budget was expended on CF patients.",cystic fibrosis
"Hypoelectrolytemia, alkalosis, and shock were present in an infant subsequently diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis (CF). Environmental temperature control was poorly maintained by a wood-burning stove in winter and contributed to the process of fluid and electrolyte loss. Pediatricians must consider CF and other processes when electrolytes and fluid are lost during environmental heat excess.",cystic fibrosis
"Purpose of review: Malnutrition is one of the major burdens of disease in cystic fibrosis. The prevention of malnutrition remains a priority throughout the life of a patient with cystic fibrosis. Literature and guidelines on the management of nutrition in cystic fibrosis have been published; however, here we review updated findings in cystic fibrosis nutrition as well as the role of novel treatments. Recent findings: We review the latest studies on the importance and consequences of nutrition in cystic fibrosis. Novel findings on specific nutrients such as vitamin D and sodium can improve our care and thereby health and growth outcomes. The role of exercise has been further studied. In the field of new treatments, we review the role of cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator potentiators and modulators in cystic fibrosis nutrition. A new feeding tube fat-digesting device has been developed and shows promise in cystic fibrosis enteral nutrition. Summary: Advances in the nutritional care of cystic fibrosis are forming and believed to further develop in the near future, adding to the recent progress in cystic fibrosis patients' health, survival, and quality of life.",cystic fibrosis
Fetal death is not commonly associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). We report a case of late intrauterine death attributed to cardiovascular failure and shock consequent to malrotation and intestinal volvulus in a fetus affected with CF. An argument is made that CF promoted this deleterious incident. Whole blood or cell-rich tissue specimens should be preserved and genetic testing for CF considered in stillbirths with intestinal complications.,cystic fibrosis
The results of lobar resection to treat severe localised bronchiectasis in six children with cystic fibrosis are described. Sustained clinical improvements occurred in children undergoing this surgical approach to treatment. Detailed assessment and intensive preoperative and postoperative medical treatment are essential to a favourable outcome in carefully selected patients.,cystic fibrosis
"Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations commonly complicate the care of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Despite recent approval of CF transmembrane conductance regulator modulating agents that can improve pulmonary function, GI disorders continue to be relevant and require innovative therapies. This article discusses the most common GI complications of CF, including reflux, pancreatic insufficiency, small bowel intestinal overgrowth, distal intestinal obstruction syndrome, and GI malignancy, with emphasis on clinical presentation and management.",cystic fibrosis
"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide regional information about lung structural changes in cystic fibrosis (CF), albeit at lower spatial and temporal resolution than computed tomography. The lack of ionizing radiation associated with MRI may make MRI an attractive alternative to computed tomography in applications in which repeated or serial scanning is desired. Furthermore, MRI can provide functional information about the lung, which may prove to be a useful outcome measure in CF. In this article, the MRI findings of CF are described, and the newer functional magnetic resonance techniques for imaging the lung are discussed.",cystic fibrosis
"The life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is largely dependent on the severity and progress of the pulmonary involvement associated with the disease. Many data support the view that malnutrition and deterioration of lung function are closely interrelated and interdependent, with each affecting the other, leading to a spiral decline in both. The occurrence of malnutrition appears to be associated with poor lung function and poor survival, and conversely prevention of malnutrition appears to be associated with better lung function and improved survival. Nutritional intervention may lead to an improvement in body weight, lung function and exercise tolerance, provided that the intervention is combined with exercise training in order to increase both respiratory and other muscle mass. These improvements can be preserved when patients have the stamina to continue with a high-energy, high-fat diet and daily exercise training at home.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) has a variety of pulmonary manifestations that include pneumonia, pulmonary abscess, bronchiectasis, hemoptysis, and pneumothorax. Although newer therapies have greatly improved survival of patients with CF, surgical interventions for definitive treatment of these sequelae are often required. Several reports have illustrated that, with the current advances in the perioperative treatment and care of CF patients, surgical interventions for these pulmonary manifestations may be performed safely, resulting in a greatly improved quality of life. Also, although improvements in lung transplantation offer new hope for definitive treatment of those patients with cystic fibrosis, special considerations regarding other surgical issues, such as the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux, need to be addressed.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is a complex multi-systemic chronic disease characterized by progressive organ dysfunction with development of fibrosis, possibly affecting the heart. Over the last four decades pathological, experimental, and clinical evidence points towards the existence of a specific myocardial involvement in cystic fibrosis. Multi-modality cardiac imaging, especially recent echocardiographic techniques, evidenced diastolic and/or systolic ventricular dysfunction in cystic fibrosis leading to the concept of a cystic fibrosis-related cardiomyopathy. Hypoxemia and inflammation are among the most important factors for heart involvement in cystic fibrosis. Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator was found to be involved in the regulation of cardiomyocyte contraction and may also account for cystic fibrosis-related myocardial dysfunction. This review, mainly focused on echocardiographic studies, seeks to synthesize the existing literature for and against the existence of heart involvement in cystic fibrosis, its mechanisms and prognostic implications. Careful investigation of the heart function may be helpful for risk stratification and therapeutic decisions in patients with cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
The nasal epithelium of the mouse closely mimics the bioelectrical phenotype of the human airways. Ion transport across the nasal epithelium induces a nasal transepithelial potential difference. Its measurement by a relatively non-invasive method adapted from humans allows in vivo longitudinal measurements of CFTR-dependent ionic transport in the murine nasal mucosa. This test offers a useful tool to assess CFTR function in preclinical studies for novel therapeutics modulating CFTR activity. Here we extensively review work done to assess transepithelial transport in the murine respiratory epithelium in the basal state and after administration of CFTR modulators. Factors of variability and discriminative threshold between the CF and the WT mice for different readouts are discussed.,cystic fibrosis
"A crucial part of the management of patients with cystic fibrosis is ensuring that dietary requirements are met, and therefore weight gain and growth are achieved. The author outlines the nutritional problems faced by this client group and suggests how they may be overcome. She argues that optimum nutrition contributes not only to an improved standard of health, but also to the overall quality of life of patients with cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Great progress has been made both in understanding the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis and in providing comprehensive medical care for both children and adults with this illness. Cystic fibrosis is the most common genetic disease affecting white people in the United States. Whereas 30 years ago a minority of patients reached their teens, now the median survival is about 30 years and is steadily increasing. Considerable work remains to be done in order to better understand how the defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator interacts with other ion channels in the lung to create an environment of chronic infection and inflammation. There is promise in the fact that various treatment modalities are in different stages of investigation and that the improvement of the outcomes for patients with cystic fibrosis, and ultimately a cure for this disease, may be forthcoming.",cystic fibrosis
"Recent studies have identified the underlying molecular defect in cystic fibrosis (CF). Reduced or absent cAMP-mediated chloride transport in epithelial-lined organs characterizes this disease. With the identification of the CF gene, gene therapy has become a potential novel form of treatment for this disease. This article reviews the rapid progress in CF research from the understanding of the bioelectric defect to the recently begun human gene therapy trials.",cystic fibrosis
"Background: Respiratory tract infections significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality of cystic fibrosis patients. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review (Pubmed 01/1966 up to 09/2003) in order to present recommendations for the isolation of CF patients colonized with Burkholderia cepacia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Alcaligenes spp. Evidence and quality of 64 publications dealing with pathogen transmission or isolation measurements of colonized patients were evaluated. Results: B. cepacia spp. was dealt most often with and 35 of 36 authors recommended the isolation of patients colonized with this pathogen. Isolation of patients colonized with P. aeruginosa was proposed by 21 of 25 authors. Only 5 studies concerned S. maltophilia or Alcaligenes spp. Conclusions: A) B. cepacia spp. colonized patients need to get a single room for their own. B) P. aeruginosa colonized CF patients should be separated from non-colonized CF patients. C) Patients harbouring even multi drug resistant P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia or Alcaligenes spp. may not share their room with immunocompromised patients and should also be isolated when treated in intensive care units.",cystic fibrosis
"The pancreas secretes a bicarbonate-rich fluid containing digestive enzymes via the ampulla of Vater into the duodenum. Defective secretion leads to maldigestion of fat and protein with increased faecal losses. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the major cause of pancreatic exocrine failure in childhood, whereas pancreatic insufficiency in adults is commonly associated with chronic pancreatitis and alcohol ingestion. In cystic fibrosis, pancreatic function correlates with genotype; pancreatic-sufficient (PS) patients have a milder course of respiratory disease, improved survival and lower mean sweat chloride concentrations than those with pancreatic insufficiency. Recent observations suggest that mutant CF alleles are over-represented in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Few show evidence of sino-pulmonary disease or high sweat electrolyte concentrations.",cystic fibrosis
"The burden of cystic fibrosis (CF) in Latin America is being increasingly recognized and is significant compared with other regions of the world. In this short communication, we assess the current situation in some Latin American countries and make suggestions for possible directions for future focus. We discuss the work that remains in deciphering how the various genetic, environmental and medical factors interact and influence outcomes in different ethnic groups. We also consider the need for consistency in both research and access to services across Latin America, including CF registries, neonatal screening programs, access to specialized CF healthcare practitioners, transition to adult clinics and treatment regimens. Progress in these areas is likely to build on the advances to date, and improve the lives of patients in Latin America who are affected by this debilitating and life-limiting disorder.",cystic fibrosis
"Cloning of the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene and elucidation of the physiological functions of the encoded protein is a triumph, not only for molecular biology, but also for people affected by CF. For them, not only is there now the possibility of screening for the commonest mutations, but they may also look forward to the prospect of improved therapies being developed.",cystic fibrosis
"The recent introduction of mutation specific therapy to a small group of patients with Cystic Fibrosis has created the debate about the affordability of personalised medicine. I would argue strongly that the NHS must find a way to make revolutionary mutation specific therapies available to patients and explore the routes that all parties must explore to facilitate this. A process which engages industry, providers and patients will provide the best long term answers.",cystic fibrosis
"Objectives: To evaluate which factors might contribute to raised resting energy expenditure (REE) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Study design: REE and anthropometry were measured in 134 (males = 68) children with CF and 100 (males = 51) controls (range, 3-18.7 years) in an outpatient setting. Bacterial colonization, liver disease, inhaled steroid use, pancreatic and pulmonary function, sex, and genotype were determined and regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of REE in the group with CF. Results: REE for children with CF was increased on average by 7.2% compared with controls. This increase was greater for females than for males. REE in males was positively associated with fat-free mass (FFM), pancreatic insufficiency (PI), and liver disease, and negatively associated with pulmonary function, whereas in females, REE was positively associated with FFM and PI. REE (adjusted for FFM) was higher in children with a severe mutation (5495 +/- 47 kJ) compared with a mild mutation (5,176 +/- 124 kJ, P <.02). Conclusions: PI, severe mutations, and female sex are the main contributing factors to elevated REE in patients with CF with near normal pulmonary function.",cystic fibrosis
"Early and aggressive therapy already at the stage when no apparent signs of significant lung disease are detectable, may delay the development and progression of cystic fibrosis (CF). Identification of markers for early pulmonary disease in CF is crucial to monitor adherence to preventive therapy and determine its success. Currently several surrogate markers are available that are used in both the decision making and evaluation of the timing and success of early intervention namely, pulmonary function tests (PFT), microbial cultures, imaging techniques, inflammatory markers, serological markers, and several general signs such as exacerbation rate and nutritional status. This review will present the current status and discuss the significance of their application as well as their limitations for patients with CF and no apparent pulmonary disease.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease well known to paediatricians. Over recent years, its prevalence among the adult population has dramatically increased; thus becoming a disease increasingly seen in adult practice. Cystic fibrosis is a multi-organ disease, with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations involving many organs. The aim of this article is to review the digestive system manifestations of this disease: the involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, biliary system and pancreas, with a special emphasis on the adult population.",cystic fibrosis
"A number of methods are currently employed to assess the functional properties of CFTR channels and their response to pharmacological potentiators, correction of the defective CFTR trafficking, and vectorial introduction of new proteins. Here we review the most common methods used to assess CFTR channel function. The suitability of each technique to various experimental conditions is discussed.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is a common disease of the Caucasian population and is associated with significant early mortality. We present a simple and rapid method for cystic fibrosis genotyping from filter paper blood spots, using a currently available commercial genotyping kit. Using multiplex technology, genotype information on the four most common UK mutations can easily be obtained within a single working day. Used in conjunction with current immunoreactive typsinogen screening protocols, blood spot genotyping offers a method of hastening the diagnosis, and thus treatment, of cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"The past decade has seen significant advances in understanding of the pathogenesis and progression of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF). Pulmonary inflammation, infection, and structural lung damage manifest very early in life and are prevalent among preschool children and infants, often in the absence of symptoms or signs. Early childhood represents a pivotal period amenable to intervention strategies that could delay or prevent the onset of lung damage and alter the longer-term clinical trajectory for individuals with CF. This review summarizes what we have learned about early lung disease in children with CF and discusses the implications for future clinical practice and research.",cystic fibrosis
"Purpose of review: Anaerobic bacteria are not only normal commensals, but are also considered opportunistic pathogens and have been identified as persistent members of the lower airway community in people with cystic fibrosis of all ages and stages of disease. Currently, the role of anaerobic bacteria in cystic fibrosis lower airway disease is not well understood. Therefore, this review describes the recent studies relating to the potential pathophysiological role(s) of anaerobes within the cystic fibrosis lungs. Recent findings: The most frequently identified anaerobic bacteria in the lower airways are common to both cystic fibrosis and healthy lungs. Studies have shown that in cystic fibrosis, the relative abundance of anaerobes fluctuates in the lower airways with reduced lung function and increased inflammation associated with a decreased anaerobic load. However, anaerobes found within the lower airways also produce virulence factors, may cause a host inflammatory response and interact synergistically with recognized pathogens. Summary: Anaerobic bacteria are potentially members of the airway microbiota in health but could also contribute to the pathogenesis of lower airway disease in cystic fibrosis via both direct and indirect mechanisms. A personalized treatment strategy that maintains a normal microbial community may be possible in the future.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the commonest genetically inherited diseases in the world. It is characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections eventually leading to respiratory failure. One of the hallmarks of this disease is a persistent and predominantly neutrophil driven inflammation. Neutrophils provide the first line of defence by killing and digesting phagocytosed bacteria and fungi, yet despite advances in our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of CF, there remains a paradox of why recruited CF neutrophils fail to eradicate bacterial infections in the lung. This review describes mechanisms involved in neutrophil migration, microbial killing and apoptosis leading to inflammatory resolution. We discuss dysregulated neutrophil activity and consider genetic versus inflammatory neutrophil reprogramming in CF and ultimately pharmacological modulation of the CF neutrophil for therapeutic intervention.",cystic fibrosis
"In the past 40 years, the mean survival of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has increased from less than 1 year to 30 years. The identification of the gene mutated in CF in 1989 has already been followed by the first phase of somatic gene therapy in 1993. The target organ of somatic gene therapy is the respiratory epithelium, which is progressively damaged by the chronic infection and inflammation characteristic of the disease. Since in the future, more patients may benefit from somatic gene therapy, the understanding of the mechanisms leading to chronic infection and inflammation becomes increasingly important. In the future, current therapeutic measures to protect the respiratory epithelium from damage, such as intravenous antimicrobial treatment, will be improved by the additional delivery of new drugs to the bronchial tree by aerosol. Amiloride and recombinant human DNAse administered by this route have the potential to improve mucociliary clearance. Antibiotics as well as protease inhibitors delivered by aerosol should contribute to prevent damage by infection and inflammation in order to increase the probability of successful somatic gene therapy in this disease.",cystic fibrosis
"Seven adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are described. In five the diagnosis was established at adult age, the oldest being 37 years. All of them had chronic respiratory infections, but the general condition was relatively good in five of the cases. Milder cases of CF are probably underdiagnosed in young adults. Certain features seem rather characteristic for the disease and should alert the physician. The diagnosis may be suspected when a routine chest roentgenogram shows the presence of predominantly upper lobe infiltrations, atelectasis and bronchiectasis. Chronic and recurrent lung infections, especially when they are staphylococcal, can also be a guide. The sweat test is most valuable for the diagnosis, but decreased pancreatic function can support it in doubtful cases.",cystic fibrosis
"CF is a common hereditary disorder of ion transport, with increasing numbers of patients surviving beyond childhood and developing manifestations of hepatobiliary involvement. Inspissated secretions within the biliary tree result in obstruction and periductular inflammation that eventually progresses to focal and then multilobular cirrhosis. Fatty infiltration of the liver and hepatomegaly is common. Variceal hemorrhage and other findings of portal hypertension may be the initial presentation. At present, therapy with high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid should be considered standard, as it has been shown repeatedly to reduce the injurious effects of the cholestasis. Liver transplantation has been successfully performed on those with advanced disease and adequate pulmonary function. Innovative therapies for CF, including gene transfer, appear promising in preliminary studies, offering hope that earlier intervention in the course of hepatobiliary CF may soon be possible.",cystic fibrosis
"Protein-energy malnutrition with associated specific nutrient deficiencies is an important feature of cystic fibrosis and has been recognized as a poor prognostic factor. Therefore, the nutritional status of cystic fibrosis patients has to be evaluated regularly by diet diaries, clinical evaluation, anthropometry and more sophisticated methods, such as bioelectrical impedance analysis. Nutritional management, including nutritional rehabilitation programmes, of cystic fibrosis patients is well established today. Consequently, protein-energy malnutrition is no longer acceptable in cystic fibrosis patients, except perhaps in end-stage disease when lung transplantation is not considered.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a disease that has profound consequences on a family unit. As a genetically transmitted, chronic illness, it influences every aspect of family life, including time constraints, finances, and relationships among family members. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the cumulative effect of the nursing diagnoses related to the pathophysiology of CF on the nursing diagnosis, Potential for Alterations in Family Process, when a family has a child with cystic fibrosis. This nursing diagnosis was first recognized by the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) in 1982. It is vital that nurses be able to differentiate between a family having difficulty coping with a child with CF in the home, and one that is coping well on its own. The children of families that are not coping well tend to be hospitalized more than those of families that are coping well. The families use the hospitalizations as rest periods for themselves. By recognizing the cues identified by NANDA of a family having problems, early intervention can be initiated before the family is in a crisis. The family must live with CF on a daily basis for the remainder of the child's life; therefore it must be able to function at its optimum level. It is nursing's responsibility to be able to recognize and assist the family in need. A knowledge of the nursing diagnosis, Alterations in Family Process, will assist nurses in fulfilling this obligation to the family.",cystic fibrosis
"Newborn screening and extensive genetic analysis has led to the recognition of a cohort of infants with an equivocal diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) disease. This paper reviews the comprehensive approach required for diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis Screen Positive, Inconclusive Diagnosis (CFSPID) and uses an illustrative case with p.Asp1152His (D1152H) mutation to examine the varying clinical phenotype seen amongst CFSPID patients. Whilst infants are well at diagnosis, uncertainties about cystic fibrosis (CF) disease progression indicate the importance of monitoring and early specialist involvement. However, over-medicalisation can cause significant psychosocial impact on patients' and families. The complexities underlying the surveillance and long-term management of patients with CFSPID are explored.",cystic fibrosis
"Multiple guidelines have been published over the last few years for the diagnosis and management of cystic fibrosis (CF) and cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD), although some of the recommendations are based on extrapolation from other forms of diabetes and/or expert opinions. This document seeks to combine the guidelines to provide an Australian approach to the management of CFRD and establish the guidelines within the Australian CF Standards of Care. It is intended that this document will provide assistance to doctors, nurses, dietitians, physiotherapists, diabetes educators and CF patients concerning the issues surrounding CFRD, and will be reviewed and updated in 2016.",cystic fibrosis
"Advancement in treatment has resulted in a dramatic increase in life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) to well beyond 30 years of age in most centres. What was once a fatal genetic disease in childhood now sees over a third of its CF populations in adult clinics. The improved survival is multifactorial, but most attribute the reasons to more aggressive nutritional care along with better management of the gastrointestinal and pulmonary systems. Many of the nutritional and GI issues of paediatric patients remain similar when they become adults, except that there is the added psychosocial stress associated with this transition. This chapter aims to highlight the gastrointestinal and nutritional issues manifesting at the different stages of life from infancy to adulthood, and the recommended management.",cystic fibrosis
"A clinical dilemma in patients with cystic fibrosis is the determination of the nature of linear areas of decreased aeration in the lungs. It is difficult using chest roentgenograms or even computed tomography to differentiate atelectasis, mucoid impacted bronchi, or peribronchial inflammatory disease from normal pulmonary vascularity. Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive sensitive means that provides the distinction. Pulmonary vessels are easily identified, because with the spin-echo sequence that we use, the rapidly flowing blood within the vessels has no signal intensity. In contradistinction, mucoid-impacted bronchi appear as high-intensity linear branching structures. Peribronchial inflammatory disease appears as curvilinear areas of high intensity, representing inflammatory edema, around central lucencies representing bronchi.",cystic fibrosis
The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is straight forward if the clinical findings and sweat sodium are considered together. We describe 3 patients where the diagnosis has proved difficult as both the clinical features and sweat sodium have varied between normal and abnormal.,cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is the most common, potentially lethal genetic defect in the Caucasian population. During recent years it has been increasingly associated with a number of hepatic and biliary abnormalities, of which chronic cholestatic liver disease is by far the most relevant. Plugging of intrahepatic bile ducts with inspissated secretions is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis. Attempts have been made to provide uniform criteria to identify patients with early, possibly reversible, hepatic lesions, as well as to assess severity of liver disease. It has been estimated that bout 13% of cystic fibrosis patients present serum liver enzyme abnormalities, but prevalence of liver involvement is likely to be higher. Due to decreasing mortality from extrahepatic causes in cystic fibrosis and to the widespread use of laboratory tests and ultrasound examination, patients with minor degree of liver involvement will be increasingly represented in future. Oral bile acid therapy is promising, but its long-term benefits in terms of survival and prevention of major complications of liver cirrhosis remain to be established. Liver transplantation is the only potentially curative treatment for patients with advanced stage liver disease and mild pulmonary involvement.",cystic fibrosis
"The incidence of and mortality from cystic fibrosis in New Zealand from 1960 to 1983, has been reviewed. Cystic fibrosis subjects have been located from data obtained from New Zealand paediatricians, the Cystic Fibrosis Association and hospital admission records. Mortality figures in the years 1960-1982 were also obtained. The incidence of cystic fibrosis of 1: 3179 non-Maori births was similar to that reported previously. Those born during 1970-1983, have a significantly better survival than those born before 1970. The survival figures are similar to those in England and Wales, but are considerably lower than those reported from Canada, or cystic fibrosis centres in the United States and Australia.",cystic fibrosis
"The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content of sputum from cystic fibrosis patients was examined to establish if it was likely to be a useful indicator of worsening clinical condition. The assay was reproducible (coefficient of variation 4.2%) and added DNA could be demonstrated. Added antibiotics did not influence the result. The daily DNA content in the sputum showed similar variations to the weight, but the DNA output (content X weight/24 h) was perhaps a more sensitive indicator of clinical status. There was a weak, negative correlation between DNA output and peak expiratory flow rate.",cystic fibrosis
"I remember sitting in one of my genetics lectures in the early days of university and being in awe of the complexity of the human being but also at science’s ability to probe it. We were in the thick of The Human Genome Project’s culmination and all that it promised for the future of medicine. My mind wandered from the nitty-gritty of base pairs to imagine a time when one’s personalised blueprint would be an essential tool in the doctor’s armament, as commonplace and essential as a full blood examination or electrocardiogram.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects multiple organs including the lung, liver, and pancreas. Lung transplant, liver transplant, and combined lung-liver transplant have become well-established therapies for CF patients with end-stage organ failure. Thus far, however, there has been limited experience with pancreas transplantation in CF. In this report, we detail the clinical history, transplant procedure, and post-operative recovery of a patient who underwent combined lung-liver-pancreas transplant for advanced CF.",cystic fibrosis
"The agglutination of the bacterium Proteus vulgaris by serum from cystic fibrosis patients and obligate heterozygotes was shown to be insufficiently specific or reproducible to be of diagnostic value by itself. Approximately 20% of health controls gave a substantial agglutination reaction, whereas the carrier frequency for cystic fibrosis is around 5%. The agglutination did not predominantly involve the bacterial flagella, but appeared to depend on components of the cell surface. The main serum proteins that bind to P. vulgaris cells were shown to be albumin, immunoglobulin G, and complement component C3. In addition, an unidentified protein(s) of low molecular weight was found to bind to the cells. However, no systematic differences were found in the proteins that bind to P. vulgaris cells between cystic fibrosis and normal sera.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common monogenic autosomal recessive disorder with progressive chronic evolution which is potentially lethal. Poor growth is a characteristic of children suffering from cystic fibrosis. A poor nutritional status is an independent risk factor for inadequate survival in cystic fibrosis and is associated with disease complications. The appropriate nutritional management is an important part of the treatment so that the patient with cystic fibrosis can achieve normal growth and development and maintain the best possible health status. A balanced diet supplemented with snacks high in fat and calories is necessary to increase the caloric intake in children with cystic fibrosis. Children with cystic fibrosis have higher caloric needs than healthy children of the same age and sex. Malnutrition in CF is multifactorial. Cystic fibrosis is a complex multisystem disorder affecting mainly the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system. In the past, malnutrition was an inevitable consequence of disease progression, leading to poor growth, impaired respiratory muscle function, decreased exercise tolerance and immunological impairment. A positive association between body weight and height and survival has been widely reported. The energy requirements of patients with CF vary widely and generally increase with age and disease severity. Cystic fibrosis remains a paediatric disorder which is often underdiagnosed but which, if therapeutically managed properly (by means of drug therapy as well as by appropriate physiotherapy techniques), can lead to improved quality of life and, thus, to a bigger life expectancy.",cystic fibrosis
"Incubation of polystyrene latex particles with CF serum leads to reduced electrophoretic mobility (EPM) measured by a particle electrophoresis device. About 85% of 50 CF patients, 60 CF heterozygotes and 190 controls (healthy subjects and patients with different disorders) could be identified correctly.",cystic fibrosis
"A method for the direct direction of the delta F508 mutation in the cystic fibrosis gene has been developed and applied to the analysis of over 280 individuals including 104 individuals with cystic fibrosis. This technique allows the rapid analysis of DNA from whole blood, Guthrie card blood spots, and the antenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis from chorionic villus biopsy samples. Based on these analyses, the delta F508 mutation is found in 77.88% of cystic fibrosis chromosomes in New Zealand cystic fibrosis patients. Thus this test can be used to establish a direct DNA diagnosis in over 60% of cystic fibrosis patients. Approximately a further 30% are heterozygous for this mutation.",cystic fibrosis
"Diabetes is a frequent complication seen in cystic fibrosis patients as they reach adulthood. Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is distinguished as a separate entity with features that include progressive loss of islet beta cell mass and insulin deficiency, as well as insulin resistance. Abnormalities in glucose tolerance may be detectable for many years prior to the development of overt diabetes. Therefore oral glucose tolerance testing is the preferred screening method for the identification of those patients at the highest risk for progression to diabetes. Progression to diabetes has been linked to poor outcomes in CF including loss of pulmonary function and increased mortality among females. Given the role that insulin deficiency plays in CFRD, insulin replacement therapy remains the only recommended intervention. In the absence of definitive supportive data, the use of oral antidiabetic agents is not considered standard therapy and needs further study. As with other forms of diabetes, CFRD patients also experience microvascular complications and should be periodically evaluated for manifestations.",cystic fibrosis
"Background: Pulmonary exacerbations (P Exs) are important in cystic fibrosis (CF). They are very common, and are associated with poor quality of life. P Exs are regarded as an important end point in clinical trials. Risk factors associated with increase in P Exs have not been examined at a large scale. This study investigates factors associated with P Exs in a large cohort of adolescent and adult patients. Patients and methods: This is a cross-sectional study on data collected in the South and West Regions in England in 2002. Patients aged 16 years and over were included. Data on age, gender, FEV(1), body mass index (BMI), infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and on CF-related diabetes were included in the analysis. P Ex was defined as an episode treated with IV antibiotics. Forward stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed with the number of P Exs being the independent variable. The rest of the variables were considered to be the dependent variables. Results: Data from 341 patients (194 female), mean age (SD), 24.9 (8.9) years were available. In 2002, a total of 599 P Exs were reported, median 1.00 range 0-16 P Exs. Using stepwise multiple regression analysis factors associated with increased number of P Exs were: infection with Pa (t-value -5.0, P < 0.0001), FEV(1), (t-value -4.9, P < 0.0001) and diabetes mellitus, (t-value -2.1, P = 0.04). Age, gender and BMI did not influence the annual number of exacerbations. Conclusions: In this study, risk factors for P Exs were found to be as follows: growth of Pa in the sputum, reduced FEV1 and CF-related diabetes mellitus.",cystic fibrosis
"Parotid saliva samples from cystic fibrosis homozygotes, heterozygotes and normal individuals were tested by the zeta potential technique for secretion factor in a double-blind experiment. There was no overlap between zeta potential reduction of the control group and the cystic fibrosis test groups, indicating that the zeta potential test may be detecting a unique component in saliva of cystic fibrosis genotypes.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is a multiorgan autosomal recessive disease resulting from mutations in a gene located on the long arm of chromosome 7. The disease is usually diagnosed in the first few years of life when it typically presents with severe pulmonary manifestations and pancreatic insufficiency; however, a small percentage of patients with less dramatic symptoms is not diagnosed until adolescence or even adulthood. The genotype of each patient seems to influence the various forms of clinical presentation. Although uncommon, acute recurrent pancreatitis can be one of the forms of delayed presentation of cystic fibrosis. We report the case of an 17-year-old man who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis after presenting 2 episodes of acute pancreatitis without associated pancreatic insufficiency. Subsequent study also revealed nasal polyps.",cystic fibrosis
"The pulmonary involvement in cystic fibrosis (CF) is discussed from several perspectives including historical, current treatment, and possible future therapies. The clinical realities that have limited and frustrated the successful control of the pulmonary progression are reviewed. A variety of pending new therapies are briefly presented including antiinflammatory agents, protease inhibitors, ion transport inhibitors, antiviscosity agents, chloride channel modifiers, and immunomodifiers. An appeal is made for more effective down-regulation of the overstimulated local and systemic immune responses to the chronic inflammatory processes. More attention needs to be paid to improvement of current methods of aerosol administration that will be of critical importance for living cell/viral/gene/liposome delivery. Other means of buying additional survival time are urgently needed such as improvements in lung transplantation and better treatment of cor pulmonale. The explosion of molecular genetics progress in CF basic research is an exciting and encouraging dynamic that may lead to a cure for patients with CF in spite of the more than 200 known genetic variations known to date. The survival of CF patients has increased 1 year for 1 year during the past 10 years and now is 29.4 years in 1991. If this progress can be maintained, the hope is that advances in molecular genetics and cell electrophysiology can soon be brought to clinical application in an effective fashion. A magnificent choice of new treatment directions is becoming available, leading to very realistic hope and optimism for the future for patients with CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Since the early 1990s the management of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) has come a long way and advances in both nutritional and medical care have resulted in a median age of survival of 30-35 years, as compared with a life expectancy of <1 year in the 1950s. The first definitive reports of glucose intolerance or diabetes in CF are from 1955. The combination of CF and related diabetes (CFRD) has a negative impact on survival. CFRD is now the most common complication of CF (50% of the CF patients will develop diabetes by the age of 30 years), and is associated with a 6-fold increase in morbidity and mortality. CFRD is usually asymptomatic and can remain undetected for up to 4 years prior to diagnosis. The objective of this report was to review the current literature (Medline and Pubmed searches) on CFRD in children and adolescents and provide a comprehensive report of incidence, prevalence and pathophysiology of insulin deficiency and insulin insensitivity. Along with survival and prognosis in CFRD the current management strategies in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of CFRD will also be addressed.",cystic fibrosis

This manuscript complements the plenary address given by Dr Wayne Morgan at the 2016 North American CF Conference by summarizing the key points from the presentation and providing additional detail and information.",cystic fibrosis
"Introduction: Most of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients survive now into adulthood and they are transferred to pulmonologist care. Aims: An overview of progress in care for CF adults in Czech Republic and evaluation of relationship of pulmonary function, nutritional status and airway colonization. Methods: All adult CF patients followed in pulmonary departments from December 1987 to December 2007 were included into study. Data about survival status, pulmonary function, nutritional status, airway colonization and other pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations of CF were collected from patients' records. Results: Total of 206 patients (96 females) were followed. Pancreatic insufficiency was present in 175 (85.0%), liver disease in 61 (29.6%) and insulin treatment in 58 (28.2%) patients. Bone disease was found in 70 (46.7%) from 150 examined patients. Sixty-two patients (23 females) died at mean age 25.4 +/- 5.5 years (median 24.3 years). Worse survival was recorded in patients with Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) airway colonization (24.4 +/- 4.0 vs 28.5 +/- 7.0 years, p = 0.012). One hundred forty-four living patients were followed to date of the 31st December 2007 with mean age 27.5 +/- 6.5 years (median 26.5 years), FEV1 64.4 +/- 28.5% pred. and BMI 20.9 +/- 3.1 kg/m2. Worse pulmonary function was present in patients with BCC colonization (FEV1 58.8 +/- 21.9 vs 67.8 +/- 27.3% pred., p = 0.041) and in malnourished patients (FEv1 49.5 +/- 18.5 vs 69.7 +/- 25.9% pred., p < 0.0001). BCC colonization was found in 54 (37.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) colonization in 92 (63.9%) and colonization without BCC or PA in 40 (27.8%) patients, respectively. Malnutrition (BMI < 19.0 kg/m2) was recorded in 38 (26.4%) patients. Conclusion: This study confirms growing number of CF adults in Czech Republic, close relationship of pulmonary function and nutritional status and also unfavourable influence of BCC colonization.",cystic fibrosis
"In this study we have presented the diagnostic difficulties in a child with cystic fibrosis recognised basing on the clinical picture of the disease, together with two elevated values of sweat chloride tests. The diagnosis was confirmed by an identification of delta F 508 mutation on both cystic fibrosis chromosomes. Normal sweat test results in a first stage of diagnosis performed twice in a newborn period were a factor which delated the diagnosis.",cystic fibrosis
"The purpose of this study was to describe both the level and relationship of physical activity and exercise in children with cystic fibrosis of varying degrees of severity. Thirty-six children (19 girls and 17 boys) between 6 and 19 years of age with cystic fibrosis underwent pulmonary function and graded treadmill testing. Physical activity was measured with a 7-item Likert-scaled Activity Questionnaire completed by parents (0.87, Alpha coefficient). Subject's severity of disease classifications based on pre-exercise pulmonary functions were as follows: 61% were in the normal category; 26% in mild; 8% in moderate; and 5% in severe. Activity scores ranged from 5 to 33 (x = 22. +/- 6.80). The subjects' levels of fitness were low as determined by their maximal oxygen uptake values. Correlations showed no significant relationships between the activity scores and oxygen uptake measures. Nurses can develop individualized exercise regimens based on clinical and psychosocial data as well as exercise testing for children with cystic fibrosis and their families.",cystic fibrosis
"Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome of the type of prescreening counseling on choices for prenatal cystic fibrosis screening. Study design: From October 2001 to November 2002, regardless of ethnicity, all prenatal patients (n = 855) at the Air Force Medical Genetics Center, Biloxi, Miss, received education on prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis by group genetic counseling either by a presentation by a genetics professional (430 patients) or by a similar audiovisual presentation only (425 patients). A combination pretest/posttest document was used to evaluate learning and served as the consent. Partner testing was recommended for mutation-positive patients. Results: Fifty-eight percent patients requested screening, of whom 68% were white. Regardless of the type of counseling, patients showed an improvement in knowledge based on pre- and posttest scores. There was no significant difference in choices to undergo screening on the basis of counseling method. Fifteen mutation carriers were identified. Only 6 partners of mutation-positive patients were available and consented to be tested. To date, no infants have been born with cystic fibrosis. Conclusion: Audio-visual counseling is an effective means to educate patients about genetic screening and does not require a trained genetics professional to administer. Partner testing in mobile populations may prove problematic.",cystic fibrosis
"At the Department for TB and Respiratory Diseases of the Faculty Hospital in Prague Motol at present half the patients with cystic fibrosis who in the Czech Republic reached adult age are being followed-up. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the nutritional profile of these adult patients with cystic fibrosis. The authors examined 15 patients, mean age 22.9 +/- 3.2 years. The examination included assessment of height, body weight, skinfold thickness above the triceps, brachii, the energy output transferrin, blood gases. Functional examination of the lungs was made by the method of the flow-volume curve. The body mass index (BMI) was 18.04 +/- 4.17, albumin 32.75 +/- 4.57. The resting energy expenditure was 112.1 +/- 20.8% of the basal energy output calculated according to the Harris-Benedict formula. The mean value of pO2 was 8,081 +/- 1,145 kPa, pCO2 5,841 +/- 1,197 kPa. The results indicate malnutrition of the examined patients: in general the findings can be considered as a sign of severe protein-energy malnutrition. The baseline study confirmed the assumption of a high prevalence of nutritional disorders in adult patients with cystic fibrosis. The next essential step must be to ensure comprehensive and individualized nutritional intervention.",cystic fibrosis
"Airway disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) is the major cause of death and is presently inadequately treatable, but genetic therapies offer the hope that such life-long disease will be curable, or at least satisfactorily treated. Normal pathogen defences that have evolved on airway surfaces also prevent the various gene vectors now available from producing effective gene transfer. Nevertheless, findings from basic research and human clinical trials are revealing how these barriers might be overcome or circumvented, with benefits to therapeutic efficacy and patient safety. Though progress is slower than expected or desired, the therapeutic rewards will be great when safe and effective gene therapy for CF airway disease becomes a clinical reality.",cystic fibrosis
"Early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) provides an opportunity to improve disease control and prevent early complications. Of patients with CF in the United States, 10% are identified early through newborn screening (including infants born in Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and parts of California, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Montana). Successful screening programs in these states have stimulated other states to consider adding CF screening to their newborn programs. Additionally, new technology permits expanded screening for numerous genetic conditions. Genetic screening, such as that used most frequently for CF, creates new challenges for the clinician, including atypical disease presentations and carrier detection. In this review, we examine the many advances in CF newborn screening and early care that were reported during the last few years.",cystic fibrosis
"This report is a summary of a meeting convened by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to develop a consensus among nutrition specialists and cystic fibrosis care givers regarding optimal nutritional management of patients with cystic fibrosis. The first section of the report provides a rationale for emphasizing nutritional management of this genetic disorder. The multiple factors causing malnutrition and a negative energy balance are outlined. The second section provides guidelines for routine assessment of nutrition in these patients. Five categories of nutritional status are defined based on ideal weight for height, age, and gender. These categories are used to formulate a graded response for nutritional intervention. Recommendations are provided for routine dietary supplements, vitamin supplements, and pancreatic enzyme replacement. The primary aim of this report is to educate clinicians as to the importance of frequent assessments and early intervention.",cystic fibrosis
"The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is usually established by the presence of chronic obstructive lung disease and/or gastrointestinal compromise, together with elevated sweat electrolytes or pathologic changes in tissue. Because of its highly variable genetic penetrance, the disease is characterized by varying degrees of involvement of different exocrine systems.",cystic fibrosis
"We describe a 19-year-old cystic fibrosis patient, with pancreatic insufficiency since the age of 4 who presented at the age of 13 with postprandial abdominal pain. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed several pancreatic cysts that progressively increased in diameter over 6 years. The lack of association with clinical and biochemical signs of acute pancreatitis is highlighted.",cystic fibrosis
"The development of mouse models for cystic fibrosis has provided the opportunity to dissect disease pathogenesis, correlate genotype and phenotype, study disease-modifying genes and develop novel therapeutics. This review discusses the successes and the challenges encountered in characterizing and optimizing these models.",cystic fibrosis
"Respiratory support using negative extrathoracic pressure or high-frequency chest wall oscillation was used to treat 3 infants with cystic fibrosis and respiratory failure who had not responded to maximal medical therapy. Beneficial clinical effects were noted in all three cases. Pulmonary function testing was performed in 2 cases, and measures of compliance increased.",cystic fibrosis
"Clinical and radiological findings, quantified by special scores, in 36 patients with cystic fibrosis are compared with lung function measurements, including the ratio of RV/TLC and FEV/VC and the arterial blood gases at rest and during exercise. Although respiratory function tests were found to correlate well with both the pulmonary finding score and the chest radiographic score, distinction of three severity groups was possible only by a vector calculation of the blood gases in PaO2-PaCO2-diagram, at rest and during exercise. Thus, measurements of pO2 and pCO2 at rest and on exercise appear to be a helpful adjuvant to routine spirometry for the individual appraisal of the degree of lung involvement, performance and care level.",cystic fibrosis
Cystic Fibrosis is the most frequent hereditary disease in Caucasians. Its clinical presentation may be very variable. Neonatal cholestasis is a typical but rare primary clinical manifestation that usually occurs in the first 3 weeks of life. It is often associated with meconium ileus. We present the case of an infant with cystic fibrosis whose primary clinical manifestation was cholestasis and liver failure at the age of 6 weeks.,cystic fibrosis
"1. Measurements of resting metabolic rate were made by open-circuit indirect calorimetry in 78 unrelated cystic fibrosis patients and 30 healthy control subjects. The aims of this study were: (i) to determine the range of variability in resting metabolic rate in cystic fibrosis, (ii) to relate this to pulmonary function and body size, and (iii) to investigate the hypothesis that, in cystic fibrosis, genotype exerts a significant influence on energy requirements. 2. There was no significant difference in age or body weight between patients with cystic fibrosis and control subjects. Resting metabolic rates for control subjects fell within +/- 10% of predicted values. Fifty-nine per cent of patients with cystic fibrosis had elevated resting metabolic rates (i.e. greater than 111% of predicted). Genotype analysis divided the patients with cystic fibrosis into three groups: delta F508 homozygotes, delta F508 heterozygotes and others. Patients homozygous for the delta F508 allele had a significantly higher resting metabolic rate (121% of predicted, 95% confidence interval 116-126%), compared with other genotypes (P less than 0.005). 3. There were significant differences in pulmonary function between the groups (P less than 0.005). However, after adjustment of individual resting metabolic rates for differences in pulmonary function by using analysis of covariance, resting metabolic rates remained significantly higher for delta F508 homozygotes than for other genotypes (P less than 0.05). 4. We conclude that there is a significant contribution to resting metabolic rate in cystic fibrosis associated with specific mutations that is not explained by declining pulmonary function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",cystic fibrosis
"Chronic infection is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (CF) and the main contributor to morbidity. Microbial infection in CF is complex, due to the number of different species that colonise the CF lung. Their colonisation is facilitated by a host response that is impaired or compromised by highly viscous mucous, zones of hypoxia and the lack of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). Successful dominant CF pathogens combine an effective arsenal to establish infection and counter-attack the host response, together with an ability to adapt readily to an unfavourable environment. Hypermutability is common among CF pathogens facilitating adaptation and as the host response persists, progressive destruction of the normal architecture of lung tissue ensues with catastrophic consequences for the host.",cystic fibrosis
"35th European Cystic Fibrosis Conference The Convention Centre, Dublin, Ireland, 6-9 June 2012 More than 2400 delegates attended the 35th European Cystic Fibrosis Conference held in Dublin between 6 and 9 June 2012. More than 525 abstracts were presented at the conference. There were 30 symposia with four speakers at each, in addition to numerous workshops where researchers had the opportunity to present their work into scientific, clinical and psychological aspects of cystic fibrosis care. Keynote speakers provided state of the art lectures in two plenary sessions. This report highlights two important areas in the field of molecular genetics and the need for new and validated clinical trial end points.",cystic fibrosis
"In this study the clinical data and treatment concept in 197 patients with cystic fibrosis, seen during the past 20 years at the University Children's Hospital of Berne (Switzerland), are presented. The results showed that during recent years the median age of survival, the mean age at death and the cumulative survival rates have improved. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that by forming groups of patients with similar age at diagnosis the cumulative survival rate declined in the group with early diagnosis much more markedly than in the group of patients with later diagnosis. Further evaluation of these data revealed that most patients of the former group had a more severe form of cystic fibrosis than the latter group. Since there are different patterns of severity in this disease, it will be necessary to develop staging for the purpose of statistical comparisons.",cystic fibrosis
"By use of classical linkage analysis and modern DNA technology the gene for cystic fibrosis (CF) was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 7 in 1985. Cloning of the entire gene (CFTR = Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) was published in 1989. The most common mutation (delta F508) is a three base pair deletion in exon 10, which results in a protein without the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508. The frequency of this mutation varies among different populations, ranging from 45% in the Mediterranean countries to a height in Denmark of 88% of the disease genes. More than 150 different mutations have been identified so far, most of which are very rare. CF is one of the most common severe inherited diseases, but the cloning of the gene and identification of the mutations give great possibilities for prevention permitting both carrier and prenatal diagnosis. The function of the CFTR protein is still not fully known. However, the amino acid sequence of the protein is highly homologous to those of several membrane proteins. In vitro transfection experiments indicate that it constitutes a chloride channel. Recently in vivo experiments involving somatic gene therapy on rats have been successful.",cystic fibrosis
"With increasing life span of patients with CF, more women with CF are becoming pregnant and others are seeking information about the risks involved during pregnancy and delivery. A striking limitation of the available information is the lack of large prospective studies of pregnant patients with CF matched for age and disease severity compared with their non-pregnant cohorts. A study investigating the effect of pregnancy on morbidity and mortality is being completed by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. We recommend that all women with CF be offered contraceptive measures and counseling on the maternal and fetal risks of pregnancy, including the genetic risks for the child. The issue of who will raise the child in the event of subsequent morbidity or maternal mortality should ideally be prospectively discussed.",cystic fibrosis
"The nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia salina are dependent upon the function of their salt gland to maintain osmotic pressure within narrow limits. A number of drugs interfere with this function and are lethal to the nauplii. Saliva and serum from normal persons, patients with cystic fibrosis, and obligate heterozygotes were tested for lethal effect against brine shrimp nauplii. At salt concentrations between 100 mM and 2.5 no difference was found among the phenotypes. At lower concentrations a difference was noted occasionally between some normal subjects and some individuals carrying one or two genes for cystic fibrosis. Data from an independent series of experiments indicate that the naupliar deaths result from distorted ratios of Na+/K+ and not from a specific gene product. No difference was noted in the O2 uptake of nauplii treated with saliva or serum obtained from normal subjects, patients with cystic fibrosis, or obligate heterozygotes.",cystic fibrosis
"We report a study of 128 patients, affected by cystic fibrosis, followed by Ospedale Bambino Gesù Center for diagnosis and therapy of cystic fibrosis. We evaluated, in a retrospective study, the principal symptoms at diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, underlining the frequent finding of not classically related symptoms. Median age at diagnosis was of 29 months, similar to that of other national centers. Furthermore, we report the percentages of diagnostic mistakes, which preceded cystic fibrosis diagnosis (22% of total). Considering the incidence of the disease in Italy (1:3000 live births), a careful valuation of related symptoms is necessary, even if gastrointestinal and/or respiratory disturbances are mild or underestimated, in order to reduce median age at diagnosis, still too high in Italy, compared to that reported by many North-European countries.",cystic fibrosis
The diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) requires a high clinical suspicion in patients presenting at all ages. Early recognition permits referral to a specialist centre and may reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with CF. We report the case of the oldest patient in Ireland diagnosed with CF at 76 years of age and highlight the clinical features of her presentation.,cystic fibrosis
"Meconium ileus is the earliest clinical manifestation of cystic fibrosis. We report 22 neonates with meconium ileus who had clinical evidence of cystic fibrosis. Patients were categorized as simple with inspissated meconium in the ileum with dilated loops proximally or complicated with volvulus or atresia and/or a perforation resulting in meconium peritonitis. Histopathology of the surgically resected specimens of small bowel revealed lesions typical of cystic fibrosis. Genetic studies were performed on all subjects, this study analyzes the usefulness in the detection of delta F508 mutation in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues obtained from patients with meconium ileus, ten of whom had the delta F508/delta F508 mutation.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis in the northern sector of the French ""département"" of Finistère is 1:1787 live births. Within this sector a concentration of the disease was found in a small area. The minimal frequency in this area, from 1946 to 1972, was calculated as 1 per 377 live births, the gene frequency being 0.0515. Genealogic analysis, going back to the beginning of the 18th century, showed a relationship between 8 of the 10 families to which the patients belonged. The origin of the deleterious genes may be explained by a least five primary ancestral couples living in the 18th century. Random drift is the most probable explanation for the concentration of cystic fibrosis in this region.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common severe recessive genetic disease in Caucasians. During the last years, new therapies and aggressive management of the lung disease have contributed significantly to the increased life expectancy in CF patients. A review and update of CF diagnosis and management of lung disease are included. The sweat chloride test (SCT) remains the gold standard for CF diagnosis and should be performed properly. However, in a few patients SCT results may not be conclusive to clarify the CF diagnosis. Patients with CF should be followed up in specialist Units by an expert multidisciplinary expert applying standard clinical protocols and using lung function tests, and microbiological and imaging studies. An overview with the recommendations for treatment of early onset and chronic infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and other uncommon pathogens is included. Furthermore, the management of other aspects of CF lung disease and complications is provided, as well as the indications for lung transplantation. This document has been prepared by the members of the CF working group of the Spanish Paediatrics Pulmonary Society to provide an update to the earlier documents published in this Journal in 1999.",cystic fibrosis
"Adolescents with cystic fibrosis were compared with normal adolescents of the same age and educational grade on several measures of vocational development and adjustment. The cystic fibrosis group in ages 12--16 and in grades 7, 8, and 9 scored lower than their normal counterparts in measures of vocational and educational plans, and were less realistic than normals in considering their limitations and financial constraints. In contrast, the cystic fibrosis group at nearly all age and grade levels scored significantly higher on strength of commitment to vocational choice, work values, and awareness of occupational information. Compared to 4 additional handicapped groups already studied, adolescents with cystic fibrosis scored favorably. They not only plan to work but also hold strong work values compared to normals. Rehabilitation programs should emphasize preparation for a career and the development of educational and vocational plans while the adolescent is still in high school.",cystic fibrosis
"Significant advances have been made in the understanding of disease progression in cystic fibrosis (CF), revealing a complex interplay between host and pathogenic organisms. The diverse CF microbiota within the airway activates an aberrant immune response that is ineffective in clearing infection. An appreciation of how the CF host immune system interacts with these organisms is crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of CF pulmonary disease. Here we discuss the microbial complexity present in the lungs of individuals with CF, review emerging concepts of innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens that chronically inhabit the CF lung, and discuss therapies that target the aberrant inflammatory response that characterizes CF. A greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms will shed light on pathogenesis and guide more targeted therapies in the future that serve to reduce infection, minimize lung pathology, and improve the quality of life for patients with CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Liver disease is increasingly common in cystic fibrosis (CF). As new therapeutic options emerge, life expectancy increases and common hepatobiliary manifestations impact on quality of life and survival of CF patients. Hepatobiliary abnormalities in CF vary in nature and range from defects attributable to the underlying CFTR gene defect to those related to systemic disease and malnutrition. Today complications of liver disease represent the third most frequent cause of disease-related death in patients with CF. Here we review molecular and clinical genetics of CF, including genetic modifiers of CF-associated liver disease, and provide practical recommendations for genetic testing, diagnosis and treatment of hepatobiliary manifestations in CF.",cystic fibrosis
Debate continues regarding the clinical implications for compound heterozygotes identified with Phe508del and Arg117His-7T mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene. We report respiratory exacerbations and airway culture of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a child with this genotype. Conclusion: The compound heterozygote cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation Phe508del with Arg117His-7T should not necessarily be considered benign in childhood.,cystic fibrosis
"Lung disease in cystic fibrosis is primarily due to a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulating protein (CFTR). This results in abnormal chloride transfer across epithelial membranes causing an excessively viscid mucus lining of the airways. Bacterial invasion particularly with Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa stimulates a vigorous and excessive primarily neutrophil-driven inflammatory response throughout the lungs. Products of this inflammation not only damage incoming bacteria but also the host tissue itself. Over a period of years this chronic suppurative process results in permanent ongoing lung destruction principally manifested as bilateral bronchiectasis.",cystic fibrosis
"Bilateral sequential lung transplantation is now an accepted therapy for patients with end-stage cystic fibrosis. In our experience, the use of a standard double-lumen endotracheal tube to establish one-lung ventilation during bilateral lung transplantation has been associated with difficulty in clearing the airway of the thick, tenacious secretions characteristically seen in these patients. Intraoperatively, retained secretions have resulted in inadequate ventilation with subsequent hypercarbia, hypoxia, and the need for cardiopulmonary bypass support. We therefore changed our airway management to a single-lumen endotracheal tube combined with a bronchial blocker to establish one-lung ventilation during bilateral lung transplantation. The lumen of a single-lumen tube accommodates larger suction catheters and an adult bronchoscope, which has a larger suction port. We have used this technique in our last five transplantations, finding easier clearing of airway secretions along with markedly improved ventilation compared with management with a double-lumen tube. We recommend this technique of airway management when performing a bilateral single-lung transplantation for end-stage cystic fibrosis.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease among the Caucasian population. It is caused by defects in the CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator). Although over 1600 disease-causing mutations in the CFTR gene have been described, the highly variable disease phenotype in cystic fibrosis cannot be explained on the basis of this gene alone. Both the environment and other non-CFTR genes are likely to be important. The increased understanding of pathophysiological processes in the cystic fibrosis lung has led to several studies on genes in these pathways. One of the major aims of such studies is to produce targets for novel drug developments.",cystic fibrosis
"In 1989 we knew that exercise, including regular prescribed physical activity, could be safely performed and described some of the physiological responses to exercise in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Also in 1989, the genetic defect causing cystic fibrosis (CF) was identified leading to improvements in treatment that greatly extended the life span for these patients. Increased understanding of the factors limiting exercise capacity and of the important role of regular exercise in slowing the progression of CF and in modulating some of the effects of the genetic defect on airway function has led to the consensus that regular exercise should be part of the standard of care for this disease.",cystic fibrosis
"Many of the people in Maritime Canada can trace their ancestry to some of the oldest settlements in North America. Consequently, both founder effect and genetic drift can be shown to account for the high frequency of some genetic disorders and virtual absence of others. The birth prevalence rate for cystic fibrosis (CF) in Maritime Canada is similar to other North American regions, but we recognized that similar factors might apply to CF genotypes and thereby impair the accuracy of counselling based on molecular markers. We therefore screened the majority (53%) of our CF population for the commonest mutation (delta F508) and for frequency of haplotypes based on 4 linked RFLPs: XV2C, KM19, J3.11, and MP6d9. The proportion with the delta F508 mutation--100 (76%) of 131 CF chromosomes--was similar to that found in other centres. In comparing frequencies of XV2C and KM19 haplotypes on non-delta F508 CF chromosomes with those from a more heterogeneous Canadian population (Kerem et al.) and a Swiss population (Liechti-Gallati et al.), no statistically significant differences were identified. Extended haplotyping to include MP6d9 and J3.11 alleles revealed 3 new haplotypes, but the overall frequency distribution was not statistically different. We can therefore exclude substantial founder effects in our population. Genotype frequencies and recurrence risks for non-delta F508 CF genotypes can be used in counselling most Maritime Canadian families with cystic fibrosis. Further mutational analysis should focus on chromosomes bearing unique haplotypes and individuals from specific subpopulations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",cystic fibrosis
"Personalised medicine refers to a tailored approach to treatment of an individual based on molecular analysis of genes, proteins or metabolites, and commonly involves a companion diagnostic test. It usually applies to small subsets of patients, often with rare diseases. In cystic fibrosis (CF), the best example is the CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator) potentiator, ivacaftor, relevant to the 5% of cystic fibrosis patients with the p.Gly551Asp gene mutation. However the cost of personalised medicine is too high, making it unaffordable in the long term for many healthcare systems. Society needs to find a way to make personalised medicine affordable in order to not deny life-changing treatments from patients.",cystic fibrosis
"The questions emerged in better focus: we need to know, definitively, what CFTR is and what it does. We need to know how mutant CFTR expression leads to the relentless lung disease that takes the lives of the patients. We need to know how the different mutations in CFTR behave functionally. Much more information is needed on the pathways for ion transport in the airways in order for us to consider therapeutic alternatives. Better information on CFTR expression, particularly in the lung, would greatly facilitate consideration of pathophysiology as well as gene therapy. Many of these questions can be attacked by imaginative use of the tools already in hand. The need is urgent. The wondrous scientific advancements of the last five years and the additional money being spent on CF research have bought no dramatic increase in life expectancy for the patients. Every day, three more succumb.",cystic fibrosis
"Many patients with cystic fibrosis now survive into adulthood seeking continuation of their care from adult physicians rather than paediatricians. Attention to detail is the key to successful management of this complex multisystem disorder; care is best provided in the context of a multidisciplinary, team-oriented approach.",cystic fibrosis
"A 4 1/2-month-old, white girl was admitted to the hospital with respiratory distress and persistent polymicrobial bacteremia. Cystic fibrosis associated with malnutrition and a transient defect in peripheral neutrophil chemotaxis was diagnosed. This remarkable combination of presenting features in a patient with cystic fibrosis is the focus of this case report.",cystic fibrosis
"Today, the majority of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients treated in Germany have reached adulthood. However, with increasing age the morbidity and frequency of severe pulmonary complications continues to rise. Further optimization of conventional therapy alone will be insufficient to compensate for this development. In recent years, there has been impressive progress in our understanding of the molecular basis of the CF gene and its product, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This knowledge can now be applied to develop new therapeutic strategies. However, important questions remain to be solved, i. e., little is known about the pathways that link the malfunctioning of the CFTR protein with the observed clinical phenotype. This review briefly touches on CF genetics as it applies to lung disease and will focus on the current hypotheses of CFTR (dys)function and its impact on pulmonary fluid homeostasis. New treatment options that target the molecular basis of the disease will be discussed.",cystic fibrosis
"Pulmonary disease is the main cause of the morbidity and mortality of patients affected by cystic fibrosis (CF). The lung pathology is dominated by excessive recruitment of neutrophils followed by an exaggerated inflammatory process that has also been reported to occur in the absence of apparent pathogenic infections. Airway surface dehydration and mucus accumulation are the driving forces of this process. The continuous release of reactive oxygen species and proteases by neutrophils contributes to tissue damage, which eventually leads to respiratory insufficiency. CF has been considered a paediatric problem for several decades. Nevertheless, during the last 40 years, therapeutic options for CF have been greatly improved, turning CF into a chronic disease and extending the life expectancy of patients. Unfortunately, chronic inflammatory processes, which are characterized by a substantial release of cytokines and chemokines, along with ROS and proteases, can accelerate cellular senescence, leading to further complications in adulthood. The alterations and mechanisms downstream of CFTR functional defects that can stimulate cellular senescence remain unclear. However, while there are correlative data suggesting that cellular senescence may be implicated in CF, a causal or consequential relationship between cellular senescence and CF is still far from being established. Senescence can be both beneficial and detrimental. Senescence may suppress bacterial infections and cooperate with tissue repair. Additionally, it may act as an effective anticancer mechanism. However, it may also promote a pro-inflammatory environment, thereby damaging tissues and leading to chronic age-related diseases. In this review, we present the most current knowledge on cellular senescence and contextualize its possible involvement in CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Objective: The life expectancy of women with cystic fibrosis (CF) has increased, enabling many to reach reproductive age. However, little is known about the childbearing concerns and information needs of women with CF or their preferences for information about the effect of their condition and its treatment on childbearing. The aim of this study was to identify the childbearing concerns and related information needs and preferences of women with CF. Methods: To ensure access to a diverse group of women with CF throughout Australia and to minimise the risk of cross infection, an online group was advertised and convened on Facebook from October through December 2017. In a closed-group moderated discussion, participants responded to questions about childbearing concerns and the related information needs and preferences of women with CF. Non-identifiable demographic information was sought via an online anonymous survey. The discussion transcript was analysed thematically. Results: Participants (n = 11) identified a number of concerns about childbearing including uncertainty about whether to have children; achieving or maintaining a pregnancy and giving birth; treatment and treatment adherence during pregnancy, breastfeeding and motherhood; and the impact of pregnancy and childbirth on future health. Women wanted information about childbearing as it related to their CF but reported difficulties accessing up-to-date accurate relevant information. Conclusions: Women with CF want to be better informed about childbearing, and identified a need for personalised information as well as regular reviews with their CF treating team so that they can make informed decisions about having children.",cystic fibrosis
"A 24-year-old man with cystic fibrosis and marked reduction of volume of the left hemithorax caused by skeletal asymmetry and mediastinal shift underwent successful right single lung transplantation with simultaneous left pneumonectomy. Despite significant preoperative microbiologic contamination, it proved possible to sterilize the pneumonectomy space and no airway complications occurred. Good long-term results have been achieved, and the historic assumption that single lung transplantation is unsuitable for patients with septic lung disease is challenged.",cystic fibrosis
The identification of the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene and within that gene the most frequent mutation is of major importance. The genotype/phenotype relationships in large study populations give a better insight in the clinical variability of CF. Variability between different CF patients is also detected in the intestinal chloride secretion capacity. Further research might be of value for a better understanding of the pathophysiological basis of the clinical heterogeneity in this disease. Diagnostic difficulties are present now that CF patients are being diagnosed with normal sweat chloride levels and the diagnostic value of mutation analysis fails in most of these atypical patients.,cystic fibrosis
"Physiotherapy is an important part of the daily routine of patients with cystic fibrosis. It is one of a number of treatments used to help improve the quality of life. Airway clearance techniques aim to relieve respiratory symptoms by physical means, helping removal of tracheobronchial secretions, and thereby preventing or slowing deterioration in respiratory function. Exercise is used to monitor patient progress, maintain thoracic mobility, and improve well being and morale. Cystic fibrosis patients require ongoing assessment throughout life; physiotherapists can help to minimize the effect of the treatment burden by being as flexible as possible with regard to where, when and how they assess and plan treatments with their patients.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disease. The mutation is located on the long arm of chromosome 7. Due to a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, chloride ion transport is reduced across the cell membrane. As a result, the disease can be described as an exocrinopathy. In all organs with exocrine glands, disorders occur in association with the defective chloride transport. The main impact of this defect is manifested in the lungs. Therefore, the most common cause of death is pulmonary disease with respiratory insufficiency due to recurrent infections. Unfortunately, a cure for the disease is still not available. However, new therapies that may affect the CFTR mutation more specifically give new hope for better therapeutic options in the future. The long-term goal of therapy is to develop a causal therapy for all six different mutation classes and thus for about 2000 mutations.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is defined as the most common life shortening genetic disorder in the Caucasian populations. The cloning of the gene responsible for the disease - the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator) gene - twenty years ago has greatly improved our knowledge of the pathophysiology of CF. That disease is characterized by a highly phenotypic variability and the CFTR mutations cannot explain all the variability observed in the disease severity. The possible influence of the environment and modifier genes has therefore been evocated. Several genetic variants coding for genes involved in the physiopathology of the disease have been studied, like genes involve in the immunity and the inflammatory response. Some of these genes have indeed been shown to influence the disease severity. A new approach has also been developed, analyzing the whole genome. This review summarizes the genetic basis of CF in its classical and atypical forms, as well as the work performed in the field of modifier genes.",cystic fibrosis
"Acute periods of pulmonary exacerbation are the single most important cause of morbidity in cystic fibrosis patients, and may be associated with a loss of lung function. Intervening prior to the onset of a substantially increased inflammatory response may limit the associated damage to the airways. While a number of biomarker assays based on inflammatory markers have been developed, providing useful and important measures of disease during these periods, such factors are typically only elevated once the process of exacerbation has been initiated. Identifying biomarkers that can predict the onset of pulmonary exacerbation at an early stage would provide an opportunity to intervene before the establishment of a substantial immune response, with major implications for the advancement of cystic fibrosis care. The precise triggers of pulmonary exacerbation remain to be determined; however, the majority of models relate to the activity of microbes present in the patient's lower airways of cystic fibrosis. Advances in diagnostic microbiology now allow for the examination of these complex systems at a level likely to identify factors on which biomarker assays can be based. In this article, we discuss key considerations in the design and testing of assays that could predict pulmonary exacerbations.",cystic fibrosis
"The variables inherent in analyzing the effectiveness of modalities used to achieve bronchial hygiene are numerous. Treatments may be given in a variety of settings, including intensive-care units, pediatric wards, respiratiory therapy departments, physical therapy departments, chronic-care hospitals, special education centers, and patient homes. Treatments are administered by a variety of medical professionals, allied health personnel, and lay volunteers. Motivation of the care providers as well as of the patients may vary greatly. Also, efforts are needed to study patients at comparable stages in their growth and development and in the progression of their particular diseases. Rather than perpetuating the unquestioning use of these various treatments, a series of carfully constructed and controlled studies done in collaborative fashion need to be performed. Until that time, the recommendations we have outlined dealing with each of the various segments of bronchial hygiene may serve as useful guidelines.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease characterized by chronic pulmonary infection, bronchiectasis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and elevated sweat chloride level. It is commonly considered as a pediatric disease. But it is now being diagnosed in increasing number of adults due to increased survival from availability of potent antibiotics, nutritional facility and diagnosis of mild cases which were unrecognized previously. CF is rarely reported from India and its adult presentation is rarer. Our case, a Hindu female from West Bengal, India was diagnosed to have CF at the age of 29 years. She had chronic cough and wheezing since childhood being treated as asthmatic patient. She had poor nutrional status, short stature and sexual infantilism. She had premature cataract. Because of chronic cough and expectoration we performed HRCT scan of thorax which revealed bilateral bronchiectasis. She had bilateral maxillary sinusitis and hypoplastic frontal sinus. Repeated sweat chloride tests revealed high values suggestive of CF. CF should be considered in differential diagnosis of adults with bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis or child with bronchial asthma. High level of awareness is needed to diagnose CF in India, because of its rarity.",cystic fibrosis
"Platelets are an important, albeit generally underappreciated, component of the inflammatory cascade. Platelets are known to contribute to inflammation in atherosclerosis, stroke, and asthma. They produce a large number of proinflammatory lipid mediators and cytokines, and play a vital role in recruitment of leukocytes into inflamed tissue. We review the role of platelets in inflammation, how they assist in the recruitment of leukocytes into lung tissue in asthma, and evidence of their dysfunction in cystic fibrosis (CF). Platelet dysfunction in CF could contribute to pulmonary inflammation and tissue destruction. We hypothesize that platelet activation is important in CF lung disease and suggest research avenues that might help elucidate the role of activated platelets in CF.",cystic fibrosis
"The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) is commonly confirmed by molecular genetics with the presence of specific mutations of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. We report a case of cystic fibrosis (CF) in a 15-year-old female patient who is a compound heterozygote for CFTR gene, with delta F508 and Tyr109Glyfs mutations detected. This is the first detailed description of such a case in the medical literature. The primary CF presentation occurred at the age of 9 in the form of gastrointestinal symptoms including greasy, bulky, and foul-smelling stool. The patient exhibited delayed growth, with her height and weight being below the 5th centile for age according to the World Health Organization growth curves. Pancreatic enzyme supplement treatment was started immediately, alongside high-fat and high-calorie diet, resulting in patient's recovery and development. DNA analysis of CFTR gene demonstrated the presence of del. F508 mutation and a rare combining deletion and insertion mutation p. Tyr109Glyfs. The combination of the two mutations is very rare in CF patients and is therefore valuable to document this case in order to provide information on disease progression, therapy options, and outcomes. With standard treatment and early diagnosis, the patient is currently doing well and is not restricted by the disease in her daily and sports activities.",cystic fibrosis
"A broad-based approach will be required for the development of new therapies for cystic fibrosis lung disease. Recently, rapid progress has been made in identifying and testing a number of gene transfer vectors, including adenoviral vectors and liposomes. Major problems, however, have been identified with respect to the efficiency of these systems. Preliminary studies suggest that small molecules (e.g. amelioride and UTP) may normalize the clearance of secretions from the cystic fibrosis lung. The concept of recombinant protein based therapy for cystic fibrosis has now been realized with the successful application of DNase in clinical trials.",cystic fibrosis
Different aerosol therapies have been employed to treat the underlying cause and symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) during the past two decades. A summary of the main elements of the disease and aerosol treatments employed in clinical care and experimental trials are presented. Methods of aerosol generation and characterization are reviewed. Suggestions for improving the current treatments are provided.,cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder occurring in 1 in 2,500 Caucasians of Northern European descent (which will be referred to as ""white Americans"" hereafter). One in 25 white Americans carries a single mutation of the CF gene. Recent molecular genetic breakthroughs have led to the localization of the gene on chromosome 7. Specific gene mutations have been identified in approximately 80% of individuals with this disorder. These new breakthroughs allow for the accurate identification of individuals affected with this disorder and of approximately 90% of individuals who carry the gene that causes this disorder. Nurses must become familiar with these molecular genetic technologies and their implications for nursing practice. They must be able to identify individuals who can benefit from genetic testing, communicate effectively regarding the risks and benefits of this testing, and support them once results become available. Genetic testing for CF is the first of many such tests that will become available in the future. How nurses deal with CF testing will serve as the model for future, similar testing programs.",cystic fibrosis
"Objective: To provide health care providers, patients, and the general public with a responsible assessment of the optimal practices for genetic testing for cystic fibrosis (CF). Participants: A nonfederal, nonadvocate, 14-member panel representing the fields of genetics, obstetrics, internal medicine, nursing, social work, epidemiology, pediatrics, psychiatry, genetic counseling, bioethics, health economics, health services research, law, and the public. In addition, 21 experts from these same fields presented data to the panel and a conference audience of 500. Evidence: The literature was searched through MEDLINE, and an extensive bibliography of references was provided to the panel and the conference audience. Experts prepared abstracts with relevant citations from the literature. Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience. Consensus process: The panel, answering predefined questions, developed its conclusions based on the scientific evidence presented in open forum and the scientific literature. The panel composed a draft statement that was read in its entirety and circulated to the experts and the audience for comment. Thereafter, the panel resolved conflicting recommendations and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The panel finalized the revisions within a few weeks after the conference. Conclusions: Genetic testing for CF should be offered to adults with a positive family history of CF, to partners of people with CF, to couples currently planning a pregnancy, and to couples seeking prenatal care. The panel does not recommend offering CF genetic testing to the general population or newborns. The panel advocates active research to develop improved treatments for people with CF and continued investigation into the understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease. Comprehensive educational programs targeted to health care professionals and the public should be developed using input from people living with CF and their families and from people from diverse racial and ethnic groups. Additionally, genetic counseling services must be accurate and provide balanced information to afford individuals the opportunity to make autonomous decisions. Every attempt should be made to protect individual rights, genetic and medical privacy rights, and to prevent discrimination and stigmatization. It is essential that the offering of CF carrier testing be phased in over a period to ensure that adequate education and appropriate genetic testing and counseling services are available to all persons being tested.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) was considered to be non-existent in Indian subcontinent. Reports in last one decade have suggested that cystic fibrosis occurs in India but its precise magnitude is not known. Studies on migrant Indian population in United States and United Kingdom estimate frequency of CF as 1:10,000 to 1:40,000. The clinical features are similar to that reported in Caucasian population. CF in Indian children is usually diagnosed late and in advanced stage. Children are more malnourished and may have clinically evident deficiency of fat soluble vitamins. The frequency of clubbing, colonization with Pseudomonas, and laboratory evidence of pseudo-Bartter syndrome is relatively more at the time of diagnosis. Diagnostic facilities in form of sweat chloride estimation and genetic studies are not available readily. Mutation profile is different. The frequency of common mutation F508del in Indian children is between 19% and 34%. Other mutations are heterogeneous. Management of CF in India is difficult due to less number of trained manpower, limited availability, and high cost of pharmacologic agents. The determinants of early death include: severe malnutrition and colonization with Pseudomonas at the time of diagnosis, more than four episodes of lower respiratory infection per year and age of onset of symptoms before 2 months of age. To conclude, CF does occur in India; however, precise magnitude of problem is not known. There is need to create awareness amongst pediatricians, developing diagnostic facilities, and management protocols based on locally available resources.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal inherited disease in Caucasian people. Inheritance follows an autosomal recessive pattern. Recent data indicate that there are more than 9,000 patients with CF in the UK. At a cellular level there is an abnormal CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a protein essential for chloride and sodium homoeostasis, caused by a mutation in the CF gene. The consequence of this abnormal protein is thick, viscous secretions in the lungs and GI tract, which lead to recurrent lung infections and pancreatic insufficiency with intestinal malabsorption. Most patients present in early childhood with classic CF. They show one or more of the typical CF phenotypic characteristics (chronic pulmonary disease, GI symptoms and malabsorption, nutritional abnormalities and sinus disease). A minority of patients have atypical CF. They tend to present at an older age, often in adulthood, are mainly pancreatic sufficient, have milder disease and a better prognosis. When CF is suspected the diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring sweat chloride concentration and by looking for CFTR mutations. Immunoreactive trypsinogen is measured in blood taken from a heel prick in all neonates, and is a marker of pancreatic injury consistent with (but not specific for) CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Background: Patients with cystic fibrosis classically present with evidence of pulmonary disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and high sweat chloride concentrations. Dermatitis as an initial manifestation of the disease is uncommon and has been attributed to multiple nutritional deficiencies. Observation: We describe the case of a 3-month-old female infant with cystic fibrosis presenting with dermatitis in the setting of protein-energy malnutrition. A review of the laboratory study results in this case and others showed that a deficiency in zinc, essential fatty acids, and protein likely contributes to the development of the rash seen in cystic fibrosis. Conclusions: Given the frequent delay in diagnosis, as well as the increased morbidity and mortality associated with protein-energy malnutrition in these patients, it is important to consider cystic fibrosis as a possible diagnosis in any infant presenting with a rash and other signs of malnutrition. The relative contribution of specific nutritional deficiencies and the degree to which they influence and interact with each other in producing the dermatitis remain unclear, although they may all affect a common underlying metabolic pathway.",cystic fibrosis
"78 patients with cystic fibrosis have been diagnosed in western Norway (Health Region 3) since 1960. 31 were born before 1971 (40%). 44 patients were born in the county of Hordaland (62%), including the city of Bergen where the western Cystic Fibrosis Centre is located. 24 (31%) patients were born in Rogaland, and five (7%) in Sogn & Fjordane. 12 patients have died, 9 of them born before 1971 (survival in this cohort of patients is 71%). During two decades from 1971 to 1990, 3 out of 33 patients have died (survival 91%). All patients born after 1990 are alive. The median age at death was 18.5 years. Among patients alive in 1999, 32 (41.5%) are more than 20 years and 19 (24.7%) are more than 30 years old. Median age among all patients is 19.5 years (range 3-51). Chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been diagnosed in 20.8% of all patients, which is lower than the average of Norwegian cystic fibrosis patients (35%). Survival among cystic fibrosis patients in Western Norway is good compared to data from other countries. It seems realistic to expect that our patients should achieve a median survival to more than 30 years of age.",cystic fibrosis
"Parents of children with cystic fibrosis have been reported to have a high prevalence of increased airway reactivity, but these studies were done in a select young, healthy, symptomless population. In the present study respiratory symptoms were examined in 315 unselected parents of children with cystic fibrosis and 162 parents of children with congenital heart disease (controls). The cardinal symptom of airway reactivity, wheezing, was somewhat more prevalent in cystic fibrosis parents than in controls, but for most subgroups this increased prevalence did not reach statistical significance. Among those who had never smoked, 38% of obligate heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis but only 25% of the controls reported wheezing (p less than 0.05). The cystic fibrosis parents who had never smoked but reported wheezing had lower FEV1 and FEF25-75, expressed as a percentage of the predicted value, than control parents; and an appreciable portion of the variance in pulmonary function was contributed by the interaction of heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis with wheezing. For cystic fibrosis parents, but not controls, the complaint of wheezing significantly contributed to the prediction of pulmonary function (FEV1 and FEF25-75). In addition, parents of children with cystic fibrosis reported having lung disease before the age of 16 more than twice as frequently as control parents. Other respiratory complaints, including dyspnoea, cough, bronchitis, and hay fever, were as common in controls as in cystic fibrosis heterozygotes. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis is associated with increased airway reactivity and its symptoms, and that the cystic fibrosis heterozygotes who manifest airway reactivity and its symptoms may be at risk for poor pulmonary function.",cystic fibrosis
"In cystic fibrosis (CF), a defect in ion transport results in thick and dehydrated airway mucus, which is difficult to clear, making such patients prone to chronic inflammation and bacterial infections. Physiotherapy using a variety of airway clearance techniques (ACTs) represents a key treatment regime by helping clear the airways of thickened, adhered, mucus and, thus, reducing the impact of lung infections and improving lung function. This article aims to bridge the gap between our understanding of the physiological effects of mechanical stresses elicited by ACTs on airway epithelia and the reported effectiveness of ACTs in CF patients. In the first part of this review, the effects of mechanical stress on airway epithelia are discussed in relation to changes in ion transport and stimulation in airway surface layer hydration. The second half is devoted to detailing the most commonly used ACTs to stimulate the removal of mucus from the airways of patients with CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Purpose of review: This review highlights the phenotypic features that lead to the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adults, and the prognosis of these patients. Recent findings: With the widespread availability of genetic testing and a greater appreciation of the clinical spectrum of the disease, the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is being made with increasing frequency in adults. Clinical features that lead to the diagnosis include respiratory symptoms and chronic airway infection with typical cystic fibrosis pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as nontuberculous mycobacteria. Often these patients have previously received diagnoses of asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema. Pancreatic insufficiency is much less common in the adult receiving the diagnosis, but pancreatitis occurs with greater frequency. Occasionally, individuals receive diagnoses of apparent single-organ manifestations such as idiopathic pancreatitis or congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, but with negligible involvement of the respiratory tract. On rare occasions, patients receiving the diagnosis as adults can present with classic features of the disease. Although lung disease is generally less severe in cystic fibrosis patients receiving the diagnosis as adults than in adult patients who received the diagnosis as infants, the extent of bronchiectasis can nonetheless be severe. The clinical course of patients receiving a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adulthood is largely unknown, but frequently they have milder disease and a more favorable prognosis. Summary: Clinicians must be aware of the potential for adults with chronic respiratory tract infections, unexplained bronchiectasis, congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, or pancreatitis to have cystic fibrosis despite the age at presentation.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease, particularly frequent among northern Europeans and northern Americans which affects, often lethally, the function of exocrine organs (including the respiratory, digestive, genital and cutaneous mucosae). Despite its pioneering role in areas as diverse as genetics, physiology or pharmacology, CF research still faces essential unsolved questions. In particular, the factors involved in the appearance and severity of CF airway disease remain mostly unraveled so far. This review aims at presenting current views on the pathophysiological processes involved in CF, whether these views are firmly demonstrated or still hypothetical. The various experimental models, central to CF research, are also examined. Finally, emerging therapeutic options for CF (e.g. gene and protein therapy), which raise many hopes among patients, are described.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic fibrosis (CF), a common fatal genetic disease, is a multisystem disorder whose pathogenesis has recently been linked to defects in CFTR, a newly discovered protein. CFTR is a molecular channel which controls chloride concentration in secretions of the sweat glands and the respiratory, GI, and reproductive tracts. Defective forms of CFTR, arising from various mutations in its gene, are responsible for the inadequate hydration of mucus, pancreatic juice, and other exocrine secretions. The result is dysfunction of the lungs, pancreas, and other involved organs. This article describes the diagnosis, clinical features, and approach to management of CF.",cystic fibrosis
"Cystic Fibrosis (CF), also known as Mucoviscidosis, is a chronic disease of autosomal recessive origin and so far incurable. This analysis considers some characteristics of patients and family members that indicate it is a stigmatizing disease. The CF stigmas impact on the lives of children and adolescents can affect treatment adherence, socialization, family relationships and the formation of their life histories, with direct consequences on their quality of life.",cystic fibrosis
"In many countries numbers of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) exceed that of children, with median survival predicted to surpass 50 years. Increasing longevity is, in part, due to intensive therapies including eradication of early infection and suppressive therapies and pulmonary exacerbations. Initial infections with common CF pathogens are thought to arise from the natural environment. We review the impact of climate and environment on infection in CF. Specifically, several studies indicate that higher ambient temperatures, proximity to the equator and the summer season may be linked to the increased prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with CF. The environment may also play an important role in the acquisition of Gram negative organisms other than P. aeruginosa. There is emerging data suggesting that climatic and environmental factors are likely to impact on the risk of infection with NTM and fungi in people which are found extensively throughout the natural environment.",cystic fibrosis
"Preeclampsia, also known as EPH-gestosis, is a pregnancy-specific syndrome. It affects 3-5% of pregnant women and is characterized by edemas, high blood pressure and proteinuria. Moreover, in women with preeclampsia dysfunction of many organs, such as kidney and liver, is diagnosed, while in the case of fetus growth restriction is observed. Preeclampsia, when left untreated, can lead to death. In low-income countries, this disorder is one of the main causes of maternal and child mortality. Preeclampsia predisposes women in later life to cardiovascular diseases. So far, in acute cases of preeclampsia stabilization of the mother and fetus and finally termination of pregnancy at a time optimal for both sides can only be considered. In this work, available literature data concerning the causes of preeclampsia, its symptoms, techniques for diagnosis, methods for prevention and new approaches to treatment were collected.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a common pregnancy specific disease, that presents with hypertension and a variety of organ failures, including malfunction of kidneys, liver and lungs. At present, the only definitive treatment of preeclampsia is end the pregnancy and deliver the neonate and placenta. For women with mild preeclampsia in the preterm phase of pregnancy, expectant management is generally indicated to improve fetal maturity, often requiring maternal medical treatment. Last decades, more evidence is available that the underlying mechanism of preeclampsia, endothelial disease, is not limited to pregnancy but increases cardiovascular risk in later life. In this review, we present the most recent insight in preeclampsia with focus on impact on the fetus, short and long-term outcome of offspring's, and long-term outcome of women with a history of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"The authors review hypertensive disease during pregnancy with an academic and practical view, and using the best evidence available. This disease, which is the most important clinical disease in Brazilian pregnant women, may have its incidence reduced with prevention through the use of calcium and aspirin in pregnant women at risk. Previously, it was a disease that presented with hypertension with proteinuria, but it has now been classified with new clinical parameters besides proteinuria. Morbidity and mortality should be reduced in a continental country such as Brazil using protocols for the early treatment of complications by calculating severe outcomes in preeclampsia. The early treatment of acute hypertension, use of magnesium sulfate and early hospitalization in cases of preeclampsia are concepts to pursue the reduction of our pregnant women's mortality.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy-chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia-are uniquely challenging as the pathology and its therapeutic management simultaneously affect mother and fetus, sometimes putting their well-being at odds with each other. Preeclampsia, in particular, is one of the most feared complications of pregnancy. Often presenting as new-onset hypertension and proteinuria during the third trimester, preeclampsia can progress rapidly to serious complications, including death of both mother and fetus. While the cause of preeclampsia is still debated, clinical and pathological studies suggest that the placenta is central to the pathogenesis of this syndrome. In this review, we will discuss the current evidence for the role of abnormal placentation and the role of placental factors such as the antiangiogenic factor, sFLT1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1) in the pathogenesis of the maternal syndrome of preeclampsia. We will discuss angiogenic biomarker assays for disease-risk stratification and for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the angiogenic pathway. Finally, we will review the substantial long-term cardiovascular and metabolic risks to mothers and children associated with gestational hypertensive disorders, in particular, preterm preeclampsia, and the need for an increased focus on interventional studies during the asymptomatic phase to delay the onset of cardiovascular disease in women.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disorder complicating 2%-8% of pregnancies worldwide and characterized by de novo development of hypertension and proteinuria. Current understanding of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia is limited. A main feature is disrupted spiral artery remodeling in the placenta, which restricts the blood flow to the placenta, which in turn leads to decreased uteroplacental perfusion. Impaired blood flow through the placenta might result in fetal growth restriction and secretion of several factors by the placenta-mainly pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-angiogenic factors-which spread into the maternal circulation, leading to endothelial dysfunction, which subsequently results in disrupted maternal hemodynamics. To date, no treatment options are available apart from termination of pregnancy. Despite normalization of the maternal vascular disturbances after birth, it has become apparent that formerly preeclamptic women experience an increased risk to develop cardiovascular and kidney disease later in life. One well-accepted concept is that the development of preeclampsia is an indicator of maternal susceptibility to develop future cardiovascular conditions, although the increased risk might also be the result of organ damage caused during preeclampsia. Given the associations between preeclampsia and long-term complications, preeclampsia is acknowledged as woman-specific risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Current research focuses on finding effective screening and prevention strategies for the reduction of cardiovascular disease in women with a history of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Superimposed preeclampsia refers to women with chronic arterial hypertension (primary or secondary) who develop preeclampsia (PE). Because hypertension affects 5-15 % of pregnancies, it is itself a matter of concern. However, this concern should be permanent, given the increased risk of the hypertension worsening and, particularly, the appearance of superimposed PE. The search for factors that underlie or promote the development of this disorder has been the subject of intense research. However, despite the wealth of knowledge, the cause or causes remain to be determined.",preeclampsia
"This review is divided into three parts. The first part briefly describes the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. This is followed by reviewing previously reported management strategies of the disease based on its pathophysiological derangements. Finally, the author defines the safe and acceptable methods/medications that may be used to 'prevent' preeclampsia (in high risk patients) and those that may be used to 'treat' preeclampsia (meant to prolong the pregnancy in patients with established preeclampsia). The review concludes that multi-center trials are required to include multiple drugs in the same management protocol.",preeclampsia
"This review article describes disorders that may imitate preeclampsia (PET), preeclampsia with haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP syndrome) and eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a major, frequent and potentially severe condition of pregnancy, characterized by severe hypertension and proteinuria. In this review, we describe recent advances in understanding the pathology, and discuss the long-term impacts on maternal vascular health. Next, we describe the genetic, epigenetic and immunological basis of preeclampsia. We describe the links between preeclampsia and oxidative stress in placental (trophoblast) and endothelial cells. We mention cellular and animal models commonly used to decipher modified pathophysiological pathways in a preeclamptic pregnancy compared to a normal pregnancy. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic options, readily available or in development, to improve the monitoring of pregnancies, the health of patients and that of children born from preeclamptic pregnancies.",preeclampsia
"In many centres, anaesthesia now incorporates perioperative medicine. Preeclampsia is a perioperative medical challenge requiring a multi-disciplinary team. New definitions stress the rapid progression of the disease and highlight the importance of early detection. Anaesthesiologists should understand the pathophysiology of the disease and develop the ultrasound skills required to assist in the assessment of disease severity. This facilitates the choice of anaesthesia method and perioperative management in complicated cases. Regional anaesthesia remains central, but there are important developments in the practice of general anaesthesia, if indicated. Appropriate haemodynamic monitoring should be established. Anaesthesiologists should also lead the resuscitation team in the management of cardiorespiratory failure and coagulopathy.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy affecting 3-8% of all pregnancies. It increases the morbidity and mortality of both the fetus and the pregnant woman, especially in developing countries. It deleteriously affects several vital organs, including the kidney, heart, liver, brain, and lung. Although, the pathogenesis of preeclampsia has not yet been fully understood, growing evidence suggests that aberrations in the angiogenic factors levels/activity and coagulopathy are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. The common nominator of tissue damage of all these target organs is endothelial injury, which impedes their normal function. At the renal level, glomerular endothelial injury leads to the development of maternal hypertension and proteinuria. Similarly, this disease can cause hepatic and neurologic dysfunction due to vascular damage. The current review summarizes the recent development in the pathogenesis of this disease state with special focus on novel diagnostic biomarkers and their relevance to potential therapeutic options for preeclampsia. Specifically, we will highlight the renal manifestations of the diseases with emphasis on the involvement of angiogenic factors in vascular injury and how restoration of the angiogenic balance affects the renal and cardiovascular outcome of preeclamptic women.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive disorders are a major cause of maternal death. Preeclampsia (PE) affects about 5% of pregnancies and is associated to high cardiovascular death risk. Understanding of its origin and cause is difficult and many etiologies have been proposed. So far, little can be done for real prevention and the only treatment is pregnancy interruption, increasing the child's risk for prematurity complications. Early markers of disease are a promising path for understanding the pathogenesis and developing new strategies for prediction and eventually disease prevention.",preeclampsia
"The recent demonstration of the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin administered from the first trimester in the prevention of preeclampsia will probably lead to establishing and radicating the ""inverted pyramid"" screening model for preeclampsia. Such a multiparametric approach for the screening of preeclampsia in the first trimester, albeit highly sensitive in identifying early-onset disease, is poor at screening the forms of preeclampsia occurring close to term. Late-onset preeclampsia is 3 to 6 times more common than early-onset preeclampsia and currently represents the major determinant of maternal morbidity related to hypertensive disorders of the pregnancy. On this ground, we discuss our idea to construct a second ""screening checkpoint"" in the third trimester with the aim of reassessing the risk of preeclampsia of those women who screened negative in the first trimester. If implemented, the sequential screening model we propose would convert the ""inverted pyramid model"" into an ""arrow model"" for the antenatal care of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preterm pre-eclampsia (prior to 37 weeks' gestation) remains a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality particularly in low to middle income countries. Much research has focused on first and second trimester predictors of pre-eclampsia with the aim of allowing stratification of antenatal care and trialling of potential preventative and therapeutic agents. However, none have been shown to be of benefit in randomised controlled trials. In this literature review we critically evaluate predictive and diagnostic tests for preterm pre-eclampsia and discuss their clinical use and potential value in the management of preterm pre-eclampsia. We defined preterm pre-eclampsia as pre-eclampsia occurring prior to 37 weeks' gestation. Substantial progress has been made in the development of predictive screening tests for preterm pre-eclampsia, but further research is needed prior to their introduction and integration into routine clinical practice. The performance of diagnostic tests mainly utilising angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors for determining time to delivery in later pregnancy currently hold more promise than first trimester predictive tests, possible reflecting the heterogeneity of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia, eclampsia, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome are major obstetric disorders that are associated with substantial maternal and perinatal morbidities. As a result, it is important that clinicians make timely and accurate diagnoses to prevent adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes associated with these syndromes. In general, most women will have a classic presentation of preeclampsia (hypertension and proteinuria) at > 20 weeks of gestation and/or < 48 hours after delivery. However, recent studies have suggested that some women will experience preeclampsia without > or = 1 of these classic findings and/or outside of these time periods. Atypical cases are those that develop at < 20 weeks of gestation and > 48 hours after delivery and that have some of the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia without the usual hypertension or proteinuria. The purpose of this review was to increase awareness of the nonclassic and atypical features of preeclampsia-eclampsia. In addition, a stepwise approach toward diagnosis and treatment of patients with these atypical features is described.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is the cause of significant maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. It is characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Preeclamptic women and children born from preeclamptic pregnancies are at greater risk to develop severe cardiovascular complications and metabolic syndromes later in life. The incidence of preeclampsia is estimated to be seven times higher in developing countries as compared to the developed countries. This review summarizes the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, emerging new hypothesis of its origin, risk factors that make women susceptible to developing preeclampsia and the potential of various biomarkers being studied to predict preeclampsia. The health care of developing countries is continuously challenged by substantial burden of maternal and fetal mortality. India despite being a fast developing country, is still far behind in achieving the required maternal mortality rates as per Millennium Development Goals set by the World Health Organization. Further, this review discusses the prevalence of preeclampsia in India, health facilities to manage preeclampsia, current guidelines and protocols followed and government policies to combat this complication in Indian condition.",preeclampsia
"Acute complications of preeclampsia contribute substantially to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The considerable variation in onset, clinical presentation, and severity of this hypertensive disease that is unique to pregnancy creates challenges in identifying risk factors for clinical deterioration. Delivery of the fetus remains the only definitive treatment for preeclampsia. Surveillance of signs and symptoms and laboratory parameters consistent with progression in severity requires an appreciation of the dynamic and progressive nature of the disease. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, setting the foundation for discussion of management priorities for acute complications that pose the greatest risks to maternal health.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder specific to pregnancy that remains a significant cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Identification of women who are most at risk for preeclampsia is imprecise. Because of the potential negative health consequences of preeclampsia for women and newborns and the lack of effective screening mechanisms preventing preeclampsia is an important component of prenatal care. Researchers have documented that low-dose aspirin, taken daily after the first trimester, can decrease the development of preeclampsia and reduce the incidence of preterm birth and birth of small-for-gestational-age infants. This column includes an overview of low-dose aspirin in pregnancy and a review of current recommendations from leading national organizations.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia (PE) continues to represent a worldwide problem and challenge for both clinicians and laboratory-based doctors. Despite many efforts, the knowledge acquired regarding its pathogenesis and pathophysiology does not allow us to treat it efficiently. It is not possible to arrest its progressive nature, and the available therapies are limited to symptomatic treatment. Furthermore, both the diagnosis and prognosis are frequently uncertain, whilst the ability to predict its occurrence is very limited. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs discovered two decades ago, and present great interest given their ability to regulate almost every aspect of the cell function. A lot of evidence regarding the role of miRNAs in pre-eclampsia has been accumulated in the last 10 years. Differentially expressed miRNAs are characteristic of both mild and severe PE. In many cases they target signaling pathway-related genes that result in altered processes which are directly involved in PE. Immune system, angiogenesis and trophoblast proliferation and invasion, all fundamental aspects of placentation, are controlled in various degrees by miRNAs which are up- or downregulated. Finally, miRNAs represent a potential therapeutic target and a diagnostic tool.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia, a systemic vascular disorder characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation, is the leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Maternal endothelial dysfunction caused by placental factors has long been accepted with respect to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Over the past decade, increased production of placental antiangiogenic factors has been identified as a placental factor leading to maternal endothelial dysfunction and systemic vascular dysfunction. This review summarizes the recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction caused by placental antiangiogenic factors, and the novel clinical strategies based on these discoveries.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia affects 3-5% of pregnancies and is traditionally diagnosed by the combined presentation of high blood pressure and proteinuria. New definitions also include maternal organ dysfunction, such as renal insufficiency, liver involvement, neurological or haematological complications, uteroplacental dysfunction, or fetal growth restriction. When left untreated, pre-eclampsia can be lethal, and in low-resource settings, this disorder is one of the main causes of maternal and child mortality. In the absence of curative treatment, the management of pre-eclampsia involves stabilisation of the mother and fetus, followed by delivery at an optimal time. Although algorithms to predict pre-eclampsia are promising, they have yet to become validated. Simple preventive measures, such as low-dose aspirin, calcium, and diet and lifestyle interventions, show potential but small benefit. Because pre-eclampsia predisposes mothers to cardiovascular disease later in life, pregnancy is also a window for future health. A collaborative approach to discovery and assessment of the available treatments will hasten our understanding of pre-eclampsia and is an effort much needed by the women and babies affected by its complications.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclapmsia (PE) is characterized by early onset symptoms such as elevated blood pressure, proteinuria and edema in the pregnant woman, and may result in seizures in the affected female. Currently, there are no therapeutic drugs available to treat this condition, but there are interventions to regulate the symptoms based on the gestational period of the fetus, although the largely favored option is delivery of the fetus and placenta. Objective: A search for biomolecules associated with PE was conducted so as to identify diagnostic markers and therapeutic leads. Results: The literature search resulted in the identification of biomolecules such as Corin and Placental Protein 13 (PP13), among others that are associated with PE. Thereby, giving an insight into the various mechanistic pathways involved in the causation of PE. However, it is also evident that PE cannot be solely attributed to any single mechanism but is due to an interplay of different factors that have led to the development of this disease condition. Conclusion: The identified biomarkers would ultimately help in understanding this complex disease and perhaps lead to the discovery of potential effective molecular targets for clinical trials, thereby providing a valuable therapeutic option for affected pregnant women.",preeclampsia
"Background: The pregnancy pathology preeclampsia is still among the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. At the same time, its etiology is far from being identified and remains obscure in a number of facets. A number of hypotheses have been developed to explain the altered interplay between placenta and mother leading to the clinical symptoms of preeclampsia. However, none of them offers the opportunity to explain the variability of cases with late-onset versus early-onset, mild versus severe and with or without additional fetal growth restriction. Conclusion: This paper identifies the weaknesses of the most important current hypothesis and at the same time offers a set of new elucidations including maternal susceptibility, and villous/extravillous trophoblast differentiation to explain the development of preeclampsia. Such elucidations allow following new scientific routes and pathways to untangle the etiology of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Purpose of review: Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder exclusive for pregnancy. It affects women all over the world and poses a great threat to life, both for mother and child. No definitive treatment exists and placenta delivery comprises the only known cure for PE. One of the most severe complications observed in preeclamptic women is the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) later in life. Recent findings: Both PE and CVDs share some of their pathogenic pathways and gene variations. Thus far, a number of publications have examined those relationships; however, almost all of them focus only on common risk factors. The precise pathomechanism and genetic basis of PE and its associated cardiovascular complications remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of this review is to unify and clarify the current state of knowledge and provide direction for future studies, especially those regarding the genetic aspect.",preeclampsia
"Backgrounds and objectives: Preeclampsia (PE) is one of the leading causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia is associated with aberrant expression of several MicroRNAs which function as gene regulators. The present study aims to determine the expression of MicroRNA-210 and MicroRNA-155 in Preeclampsia, and to detect the association of MicroRNA-210 and MicroRNA-155 levels with the severity of Preeclampsia. Methods: The study was carried out on thirty PE pregnant women as the Preeclampsia group compared to twenty healthy pregnant women who served as the control group. The patients were chosen at labor wards from Ain Shams Maternity Hospital during the period from June to December 2016. Preeclampsia group was then subdivided into mild Preeclampsia and severe Preeclampsia subgroups according to the levels of arterial blood pressure with the presence of thrombocytopenia, impairment in liver function, progressive renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema and cerebral or visual disturbance. MicroRNA-210 and MicroRNA-155 were estimated by a quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results of this study showed that the levels of MicroRNA-210 and MicroRNA-155 detected in the Preeclampsia group are significantly higher than in the control group. Although MicroRNA-210 levels showed high significant increase in severe PE compared to mild PE cases, there were no significant differences in MicroRNA-155 levels between the two PE subgroups detected. Conclusions: MicroRNA-210 may be the noncoding RNA at the molecular level in which the increase in its level accompanies the progression of PE; and is closely associated with the severity of Preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"The maternal syndrome of preeclampsia is mediated by dysfunctional syncytiotrophoblast (STB). When this is stressed by uteroplacental malperfusion, its signaling to the mother changes, as part of a highly coordinated stress response. The STB signals are both proinflammatory and dysangiogenic such that the preeclamptic mother has a stronger vascular inflammatory response than normal, with an antiangiogenic bias. Angiogenic factors have limitations as preeclampsia biomarkers, especially for prediction and diagnosis of preeclampsia at term. However, if they are recognized as markers of STB stress, their physiological changes at term demonstrate that STB stress develops in all pregnancies. The biomarkers reveal that the duration of pregnancies is restricted by placental capacity, such that there is increasing placental dysfunction, at and beyond term. This capacity includes limitations imposed by the size of the uterus, the capacity of the uteroplacental circulation and, possibly, the supply of villous progenitor trophoblast cells. Limited placental capacity explains the increasing risks of postmaturity, including preeclampsia. Early-onset preeclampsia is predictable because STB stress and changes in its biomarkers are intrinsic to poor placentation, an early pregnancy pathology. Prediction of preeclampsia at term is not good because there is no early STB pathology. Moreover, biomarkers cannot accurately diagnose term preeclampsia against a background of universal STB dysfunction, which may or may not be clinically revealed before spontaneous or induced delivery. In this sense, postterm pregnancy is, at best, a pseudonormal state. However, the markers may prove useful in screening for women with more severe problems of postmaturity.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific condition of increased blood pressure accompanied by proteinuria, edema, or both. The incidence of preeclampsia has been reported as ranging from 2.5% to 7%. Risk factors for the development of preeclampsia include young maternal age, previous preeclampsia, twin pregnancy, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hydatidiform mole. Vasospasm is considered central to the pathologic changes of preeclampsia, and the data suggest that this process is triggered by an imbalance between prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) and thromboxane Ax, biologically active metabolites of arachidonic acid. Preeclampsia has a wide clinical spectrum ranging from mild to severe forms and, potentially, eclampsia with symptoms occurring primarily with severe disease. Preventive strategies under investigation include calcium supplementation and low-dose aspirin supplementation. Prenatal screening, monitoring, and management of preeclampsia are presented.",preeclampsia
"This concise report deals with the known effects of progestogen lack in early pregnancy with failure of implantation and blood supply to the placenta depending on proper trophoblast invasion, spiral artery remodeling, and vessel dilatation. The pathophysiology of preeclampsia will be outlined and the most recent data on the effect of dydrogesterone presented. Dydrogesterone appears to be able to reduce significantly the development of preeclampsia. The effect is related to begin with such prevention and this should be continued until 37th weeks of gestation which would also mean prevention of premature labor.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-related syndrome, which still represents one of the major causes of maternal-fetal mortality and morbidity. Diagnosis can be made difficult due to the complexity of the disorder and its wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. In order to provide an efficient diagnostic tool to the clinician, medical societies regularly rethink the definition criteria. However, there are still clinical presentations of preeclampsia that escape the frame of the definition. The present review will address atypical forms of preeclampsia, such as preeclampsia without proteinuria, normotensive preeclampsia, preeclampsia before 20 weeks of gestation and post-partum preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) constitute the most common medical condition seen during gestation, effecting 1 in 10 pregnancies in the USA. Traditionally, preeclampsia (PE) is defined as a new onset of hypertension and either proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive woman. Preeclampsia is a potentially life-threatening condition with widespread underlying endothelial dysfunction, and accompanying inflammation, vasoconstriction, and platelet activation. Women with preeclampsia are at an increased risk for life-threatening complications and progression to eclampsia. Worldwide, 10 to 15 % of maternal deaths are from preeclampsia and related complications. Traditionally, diagnosis of preeclampsia is made based upon presence of risk factors and clinical criteria. Diagnosis is challenging in asymptomatic women early in pregnancy as well as in nulliparous women as they lack obstetric history; however, it is well known that women with previous preeclampsia have a 14.7 % risk of the condition in the second pregnancy. Prediction of those at risk and early diagnosis is crucial to enable close surveillance of high-risk women in order to improve maternal and fetal outcomes. There has been much advance in our understanding of the pathogenesis of PE and in the field of angiogenic markers. However, no one test meets the criteria for a good biomarker. A multiparametric approach appears to be optimal as we await newer systems biology approaches to give us better insight into the pathogenesis of the disease.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a complication of pregnancy that is associated with substantial maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The disease presents with new-onset hypertension and often proteinuria in the mother, which can progress to multi-organ dysfunction, including hepatic, renal and cerebral disease, if the fetus and placenta are not delivered. Maternal endothelial dysfunction due to circulating factors of fetal origin from the placenta is a hallmark of pre-eclampsia. Risk factors for the disease include maternal comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, hypertension and obesity; a family history of pre-eclampsia, nulliparity or multiple pregnancies; and previous pre-eclampsia or intrauterine fetal growth restriction. In the past decade, the discovery and characterization of novel antiangiogenic pathways have been particularly impactful both in increasing understanding of the disease pathophysiology and in directing predictive and therapeutic efforts. In this Review, we discuss the pathogenic role of antiangiogenic proteins released by the placenta in the development of pre-eclampsia and review novel therapeutic strategies directed at restoring the angiogenic imbalance observed during pre-eclampsia. We also highlight other notable advances in the field, including the identification of long-term maternal and fetal risks conferred by pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: In attempt to deepen our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of preeclampsia we aimed to study the placental component and pregnancy outcomes in two consecutive pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia in the same patient. Study design: Pregnancy and placental reports of all pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia between 2008 and 2018 were reviewed. Included were only cases with recurrent preeclampsia in two consecutive pregnancies Neonatal outcomes and placental histopathology were compared between the first preeclampsia delivery (first preeclampsia group) and the subsequent preeclampsia delivery (subsequent preeclampsia group), thus each subject served as her own control in two consecutive pregnancies. Placental lesions were classified according to the current ""Amsterdam"" criteria. Adverse neonatal outcome was defined as ≥1 early neonatal complication. Results: Included in the study a total of 83 cases with recurrent preeclampsia. The first preeclampsia group delivered at an earlier gestational age (35.7 ± 3.7 vs. 36.8 ± 3.1 weeks, p = 0.03) and had higher rates of severe features (44.6% vs. 25.3%, p = 0.03), placental weight <10th percentile (44.5% vs. 26.5%, p = 0.02), maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) lesions (84.3% vs. 62.6%, p = 0.002), SGA (44.5% vs. 33.7%, p = 0.03), and adverse neonatal outcome (55.4% vs. 34.9%,p = 0.01), compared to the subsequent preeclampsia group. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, severe features (aOR = 1.36, 95%CI = 1.12-2.36), MVM lesions (aOR = 1.12, 95%CI = 1.04-1.87) and adverse neonatal outcome (aOR = 1.26 95%CI = 1.14-2.23) were found to be independently associated with the first preeclampsia group. Conclusion: The first event of preeclampsia is characterized by an earlier, more severe presentation, as well as a higher rate of MVM lesions, SGA, and adverse neonatal outcome, compared to preeclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia remains a leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. It is a pregnancy-specific disease characterised by de-novo development of concurrent hypertension and proteinuria, sometimes progressing into a multiorgan cluster of varying clinical features. Poor early placentation is especially associated with early onset disease. Predisposing cardiovascular or metabolic risks for endothelial dysfunction, as part of an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response, might dominate in the origins of late onset pre-eclampsia. Because the multifactorial pathogenesis of different pre-eclampsia phenotypes has not been fully elucidated, prevention and prediction are still not possible, and symptomatic clinical management should be mainly directed to prevent maternal morbidity (eg, eclampsia) and mortality. Expectant management of women with early onset disease to improve perinatal outcome should not preclude timely delivery-the only definitive cure. Pre-eclampsia foretells raised rates of cardiovascular and metabolic disease in later life, which could be reason for subsequent lifestyle education and intervention.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia has been recognized for at least 100 years. In the last 20 years, the consideration of the disorder as more than simply hypertension in pregnancy has led to an explosion in knowledge about preeclampsia pathophysiology. It is now evident that for most cases of preeclampsia, the root cause is the placenta. Relatively reduced placental perfusion leads to inflammation, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which converge to modify maternal physiology, with endothelium an important target. Although preeclampsia is characteristically diagnosed in the last third of pregnancy, it is evident that many of these pathophysiological changes can be detected long before clinically evident disease. Furthermore, it is evident that the ""maternal constitution,"" including genetic, behavioral, and metabolic factors, influences the maternal response to the abnormal placentation of preeclampsia. These insights would seem to provide a guide for the prediction of the disorder in early pregnancy, along with targets for intervention. However, this has not been the case. Predictive tests guided by this knowledge do not predict well and several interventions guided by the expanded understanding of pathophysiology do not prevent the disease. We propose that these failures are secondary to the fact that preeclampsia is more than one disorder. Further, we suggest that future progress toward prediction and prevention will require research guided by this concept.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia and eclampsia continue to be major contributors to maternal mortality and morbidity. Lack of appreciation for the multi-organ involvement of preeclampsia, combined with overly rigid criteria for diagnosis, may hinder early diagnosis and appropriate management. Recently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force on Hypertension in Pregnancy evaluated the evidence and formulated new recommendations for diagnosis and management. This article reviews some of these recommended changes, including the new classification of the hypertensive diseases of pregnancy. Systolic blood pressure has been shown to be as important as diastolic blood pressure in the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Changes in proteinuria are not predictive of disease severity or maternal or fetal complications; therefore, the magnitude of proteinuria or changes in the amount should not dictate diagnosis or management. Instead, symptoms of cerebral involvement, such as headache and visual changes or signs of end-organ involvement including abnormal laboratory tests (elevated serum creatinine or liver function tests, low platelet count), are evidence of preeclampsia with severe features. Immediate induction of labor is recommended for women with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia at 37 weeks' gestation or later. Pregnant and postpartum women need to know important warning signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. Prompt diagnosis of preeclampsia and appropriate management will improve the quality of care for women.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: We focus our attention on placental genes that are repressed in preeclampsia. Methods: A search was conducted through the online PubMed database. Results: A majority of the down-regulated genes appear to be evolved as the defense and protective mechanism for the mother, namely maternal fitness genes. A half of the down-regulated genes are also located within and in close proximity to known imprinted genes. Conclusion: Preeclampsia may be associated with either: (1) down-regulated expression of genes located in close proximity to known imprinted genes, (2) an imbalance in the maternal-fetal genetic response, or (3) an interaction of the two.",preeclampsia
"Women with a previous pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia have an increased risk for recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. For severe preeclamptic women in an initial pregnancy, recurrence rates for any type of preeclampsia are very high, approaching 50% in some studies. Significant maternal and fetal complications are more common in recurrent preeclampsia compared with an initial episode. For women who have experienced a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia, a systematic evaluation for underlying risk factors may identify a specific pathway suitable for a specific intervention. Although some progress has been made in developing potential therapeutic options to prevent preeclampsia recurrence, there is a great need for better data to determine who will benefit most from any specific therapy.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia is a major hypertensive disease caused by pregnancy, inducing proteinuria and increased blood pressure starting from the second half of pregnancy (early preeclampsia) or near the end of pregnancy (late preeclampsia). Pre-symptomatic diagnosis would allow for therapeutic interventions, such as with low-dose aspirin. Among non-invasive methods to explore organ physiology, Doppler ultrasonography (US) and functional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MRI (which do not need radioactive contrast agents such as gadolinium) can be used in pregnant women. Methods: In this study, we used US and BOLD MRI to finely characterize the phenotype of preeclampsia induced by the foeto-placental overexpression of the transcription factor storkhead box 1A (STOX1A) in female mice. Results: We could observe late fetal growth restriction consistent with the placental dysfunction revealed by US and the known association between preeclampsia and intra-uterine growth restriction. On US, uterine and umbilical artery as well as heart and kidney parameters were modified in preeclamptic mice. On BOLD MRI, mean T2* values revealed considerable differences between control and preeclamptic placentas, which suggests altered dynamics of oxygen release and ratio of oxyhemoglobin to deoxyhemoglobin in the model. Conclusion: These preliminary pre-clinical results suggest that BOLD MRI could be evaluated as a prognostic/diagnostic tool for preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of maternal mortality (15-20% in developed countries) and morbidities (acute and long-term), perinatal deaths, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction. Key findings support a causal or pathogenetic model of superficial placentation driven by immune maladaptation, with subsequently reduced concentrations of angiogenic growth factors and increased placental debris in the maternal circulation resulting in a (mainly hypertensive) maternal inflammatory response. The final phenotype, maternal pre-eclamptic syndrome, is further modulated by pre-existing maternal cardiovascular or metabolic fitness. Currently, women at risk are identified on the basis of epidemiological and clinical risk factors, but the diagnostic criteria of pre-eclampsia remain unclear, with no known biomarkers. Treatment is still prenatal care, timely diagnosis, proper management, and timely delivery. Many interventions to lengthen pregnancy (eg, treatment for mild hypertension, plasma-volume expansion, and corticosteroid use) have a poor evidence base. We review findings on the diagnosis, risk factors, and pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia and the present status of its prediction, prevention, and management.",preeclampsia
"The onset of preeclampsia at or near to term is associated with low maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. In contrast, those patients (1%) who suffer early onset preeclampsia engender significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Therefore, because of the lack of proven prophylaxis for preeclampsia, prediction of risk or identification of subclinical disease is desirable to identify patients for more intensive observation. There are certain at-risk groups of patients such as those with chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, multifetal gestation, and previous preeclampsia. These patients account for the majority of cases of preeclampsia in multiparas, yet only account for 14% of preeclampsia in nulliparous women. Thus, the majority of cases of preeclampsia arises from nulliparous women without medical complications at low risk. Differences in the time of onset, severity, and organ system involvement suggest there may be different underlying etiologies that ultimately lead to preeclampsia manifested as the triad of maternal hypertension, proteinuria, and edema. Distinct markers therefore may identify subgroups of at-risk patients with separate underlying causes. These markers ultimately could be used for diagnosis of disease before the clinical appearance of maternal disease (hypertension, proteinuria, and edema). Based on data from patients with established disease, with the involvement of various organ systems, potential candidate markers would include renal function (kallikrein-creatinine); coagulation and fibrinolytic systems and platelet activation (platelet volume); markers of vascular function (fibronectin, prostacyclin, thromboxane) and oxidant stress (lipid peroxides, 8-isoprostane, antioxidants, anticardiolipin antibodies, hemoglobin, iron, transferrin, homocysteine, hypertriglyceridemia, albumin isoforms); placental peptide hormones (CRH, CRHbp, activin, inhibin, hCG); vascular resistance (uteroplacental flow velocity waveforms); genetic markers; insulin resistance; and glucose intolerance. Although cross-sectional studies have identified these potential markers, they need to be evaluated in prospective longitudinal studies with rigorous definition of outcome to determine if they are useful in predicting preeclampsia and whether they can identify different subgroups of patients.",preeclampsia
"Placental growth factor (PlGF) is an increasingly important molecule in the prediction, diagnosis and treatment of pre-eclampsia. It has pro-angiogenic effects on the feto-placental circulation and supports trophoblast growth. Mechanisms by which PlGF expression is regulated continue to be investigated. Low circulating PlGF precedes the manifestation of clinical disease in pre-eclamptic pregnancies and intrauterine growth restriction. This suggests that low PlGF is a marker of abnormal placentation, but it remains uncertain whether this is a cause or consequence. Prediction of pre-eclampsia using PlGF is promising and may assist in the targeting of resources to women at highest risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Promisingly, experimental animal models of pre-eclampsia have been successfully treated with supplemental PlGF. Treatment of pre-eclampsia with PlGF is a potential therapeutic option requiring further exploration. This review focuses specifically on the role of PlGF in normal and pathological placental development and in the clinical management of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia occurs in 3-14% of pregnancies and is defined by maternal hypertension with proteinurea, generally associated with edema, coagulation abnormalities, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The conditions can lead to eclampsia, characterized by hyperreflexia and convulsions. Several organs are afflicted by the condition, most importantly the liver and kidneys. The direct cause of preeclampsia is unknown, but the initial events are linked to abnormalities of placentation. This implies abnormalities in trophoblast invasion and in physiological alterations of placental vessels required for adequate perfusion of the placenta, which leads to ischemia. The mechanisms that link the ischemic placenta to endothelial lesions and to stimulation of vasoconstrictors and inhibition of vasodilators are still subject of speculation. The only treatment of preeclampsia is delivery. Lowering of blood pressure and prevention of eclampsia with magnesium sulfate is indicated in severe preeclampsia. Despite numerous studies attempting to elucidate the exact etiopathogenesis of this complex multifactorial disease, prediction or prevention methods of preeclampsia are not available.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia/eclampsia is a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity worldwide. Although the etiology of preeclampsia is still unclear, the clinical phenotypes of preeclampsia have been demonstrated to be related to high circulating levels of anti-angiogenic proteins secreted by the placenta such as soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1) and soluble endoglin. Because, alterations in circulating sFlt1 and soluble endoglin precede the onset of clinical disease, these factors may be useful to screen or identify patients at risk for preeclampsia. Investigations are currently underway of various pharmacologic agents to counteract the effects of sFlt1 and/or sEng as a potential treatment for preeclampsia. Recently several isoforms of sFlt1 have been described, such as sFlt1-14 which is expressed only in primates, and is thought to be the primary isoform produced by the placenta in preeclamptic subjects. Although several novel pathways have been proposed to play key roles in inducing sFlt1 production, the exact role of these pathways in human preeclampsia is still not known. Women with a history of preeclampsia have an increased risk of hypertension, and cardiovascular and renal disease. Whether these long-term observations are due to persistent and subtle endothelial damage as result of preeclampsia, or simply reflect the consequences of the vascular risk factors which are more common in these women remains unknown.",preeclampsia
"Normal pregnancy requires adaptations of the maternal vasculature. During preeclampsia these adaptations are not well established, which may be related to maternal hypertension and proteinuria. The effects of preeclampsia on the maternal vasculature are not yet fully understood. We aimed to evaluate gene expression in aortas of pregnant rats with experimental preeclampsia using a genome wide microarray. Aortas were isolated from pregnant Wistar outbred rats with low-dose LPS-induced preeclampsia (ExpPE), healthy pregnant (Pr), non-pregnant and low-dose LPS-infused non-pregnant rats. Gene expression was measured by microarray and validated by real-time quantitative PCR. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed to compare the groups. Functional analysis of the aorta was done by isotonic contraction measurements while stimulating aortic rings with potassium chloride. 526 genes were differentially expressed, and positive enrichment of ""potassium channels"", ""striated muscle contraction"", and ""neuronal system"" gene sets were found in ExpPE vs. Pr. The potassium chloride-induced contractile response of ExpPE aortic rings was significantly decreased compared to this response in Pr animals. Our data suggest that potassium channels, neuronal system and (striated) muscle contraction in the aorta may play a role in the pathophysiology of experimental preeclampsia. Whether these changes are also present in preeclamptic women needs further investigation.",preeclampsia

"Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder specific to pregnancy with a high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. The cause of this disorder is unknown. Preeclampsia likely represents the clinical end point of multiple contributory factors, and it is unlikely that any single cause will be found. The blueprint for the development of preeclampsia is laid down early in pregnancy, and delivery of the fetus and placenta remains the only effective treatment. Efforts to prevent preeclampsia in women at high risk have been largely unsuccessful. Until the pathogenesis of preeclampsia is well defined, it is unlikely that effective preventive strategies will be developed.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia, a hypertensive disorder peculiar to pregnancy, is a systemic syndrome that appears to originate in the placenta and is characterized by widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction. Until recently, the molecular pathogenesis of phenotypic preeclampsia was largely unknown, but recent observations support the hypothesis that altered expression of placental anti-angiogenic factors are responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease. Soluble Flt1 and soluble endoglin, secreted by the placenta, are increased in the maternal circulation weeks before the onset of preeclampsia. These anti-angiogenic factors produce systemic endothelial dysfunction, resulting in hypertension, proteinuria, and the other systemic manifestations of preeclampsia. The molecular basis for placental dysregulation of these pathogenic factors remains unknown, and as of 2011 the role of angiogenic proteins in early placental vascular development was starting to be explored. The data linking angiogenic factors to preeclampsia have exciting clinical implications, and likely will transform the detection and treatment of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is defined by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) as ""the occurrence of new onset hypertension plus new-onset proteinuria"" [1]. Up-to-Date elaborates a little further on this by defining preeclampsia as ""the new onset of hypertension and proteinuria, or hypertension and end-organ dysfunction with or without proteinuria, after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive woman. It may also develop postpartum. Severe hypertension or signs/symptoms of end-organ injury represent the severe end of the disease spectrum"" [2] In 2013, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists removed proteinuria as a key component in the diagnosis of preeclampsia. They also removed massive proteinuria (previously, 5 g/24 hours) and fetal growth restriction as possible features of severe disease. They found that were was a poor correlation in many outcomes between massive proteinuria and fetal growth restriction when managed similarly, with or without preeclampsia as a diagnosis. Oliguria was also removed as a characteristic of severe disease. [3] There have been several cases reported in the literature as well as by Obstetricians citing the incidence of preeclampsia occurring upwards of 6 to even 12 weeks postpartum. We hope to demonstrate what we believe to be a case of postpartum preeclampsia at 89 days postpartum.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a complex clinical syndrome, with hypertension representing but one manifestation. Pathogenetically important events in the development of preeclampsia include incomplete trophoblastic invasion of the maternal spiral arteries, poor trophoblastic perfusion, elaboration of a putative endothelial cell toxin, and endothelial cell injury with resulting activation of coagulation, impairment of vasodepressor function, and altered endothelial permeability. These changes lead to the clinical signs and symptoms, which occur relatively late in the course of preeclampsia. The primary immunologic, genetic, and biochemical basis of preeclampsia remains speculative.",preeclampsia
"The maternal syndrome of preeclampsia has previously been ascribed to generalized maternal endothelial cell dysfunction. In this review we suggest that the endothelial dysfunction is a part of a more generalized intravascular inflammatory reaction involving intravascular leukocytes as well as the clotting and complement systems. We provide evidence from our recent work and that of others that not only supports this proposal but indicates that such an inflammatory response is already well developed in normal pregnancy and that the differences between normal pregnancy and preeclampsia are less striking than those between the normal pregnant and nonpregnant states. From this we argue that preeclampsia arises when a universal maternal intravascular inflammatory response to pregnancy decompensates in particular cases, which may occur because either the stimulus or the maternal response is too strong. We conclude that there is no specific cause for the disorder, which can be better considered as the extreme end of the range of maternal adaptation to pregnancy. We propose that poor placentation is not the cause of preeclampsia but is a powerful predisposing factor. We predict that a single preeclampsia gene will not be found, nor will either a single specific predictive test or single preventive effective measure be devised. Aspects of the hypothesis are testable, and future work should allow its confirmation or refutation.",preeclampsia
"The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying preeclampsia, a serious complication of pregnancy, are largely unknown. Since, on the other hand, the various risk factors are known, primary and secondary prevention with pre- and inter-pregnancy counseling should be undertaken, and a follow-up should be conducted to evaluate any long-term organic complications. There is evidence in the literature that women with preeclampsia are particularly predisposed to developing cardiovascular diseases, especially ischemia, and it is justifiably believed that preeclampsia and atherosclerosis share the same risk factors. However, further understanding is required concerning the risk of long-term dysfunctions in other organs also involved in the course of preeclampsia: the kidneys, liver and brain. Preeclampsia is, moreover, a complex multispecialist entity, and the internist and/or the intensivist can be important allies along with the obstetrician in the management of this condition.",preeclampsia
"Recent advances in the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and understanding of preeclampsia-related morbidity provide opportunities to optimize clinical management of the mother and fetus. These discoveries are timely, as contemporary data suggest that the prevalence of preeclampsia, affecting 7.5% of pregnancies globally and 2-5% in the USA, has increased by up to 30% over the last decade. Managing pregnant patients with preeclampsia can be challenging for all members of the obstetric care team due to the disease's multi-organ system maternal and fetal effects. This review presents recent updates in the definition of preeclampsia, etiology, comorbidities and therapeutic interventions and discusses how they impact the care of these high-risk patients.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Mean platelet volume (MPV) has been explored in several observational studies in the field of preeclampsia and current evidence seem to be conflicting. The purpose of the present meta-analysis is to evaluate the reported MPV differences in patients that develop preeclampsia and to compare them to those of otherwise healthy women. Design and methods: We searched the international literature using the Medline (1966-2018), Scopus (2004-2018), EMBASE (1947-2018) and Clinicaltrials.gov (2008-2018) databases. Statistical meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 5.3 software. Results: The meta-analysis was based on outcomes reported from 50 studies that included 14,614 women. MPV was significantly higher in preeclamptic than healthy pregnant women (7905 women, MD: 1.04 fl, 95% CI [0.76, 1.32]). The mean difference was less evident among women with mild preeclampsia (6604 women, MD: 0.65 fl, 95% CI [0.19, 1.11]), compared to the severe ones (6119 women, MD: 1.28 fl, 95% CI [0.75, 1.80]). The results of the univariate meta-regression analysis showed that region, sample size, time to analysis, anticoagulant, platelet count and NOS score did not affect the outcomes of the meta-analysis. Conclusions: The findings of our meta-analysis suggest that mean platelet volume represents a promising biomarker for the detection and follow-up of patients that develop preeclampsia. However, given that the available evidence is drawn from case-control studies, future cohorts are needed in this field to accurately determine optimal timing and cut-off values that may be used in the clinical setting.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disorder characterized by hypertension and excess protein excretion in the urine. It is an important cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The disease is almost exclusive to humans and delivery of the pregnancy continues to be the only effective treatment. The disorder is probably multifactorial, although most cases of preeclampsia are characterized by abnormal maternal uterine vascular remodeling by fetally derived placental trophoblast cells. Numerous in vitro and animal models have been used to study aspects of preeclampsia, the most common being models of placental oxygen dysregulation, abnormal trophoblast invasion, inappropriate maternal vascular damage and anomalous maternal-fetal immune interactions. Investigations into the pathophysiology and treatment of preeclampsia continue to move the field forward, albeit at a frustratingly slow pace.

"Preeclampsia has been recognized clinically since the time of Hippocrates: however its etiology and pathophysiology remain enigmatic. This pregnancy-specific syndrome typically presents in late pregnancy as hypertension, edema, and proteinuria. Investigations over the past 15 years have revealed that preeclampsia is associated with abnormal placentation, reduced placental perfusion, endothelial cell dysfunction, and systemic vasospasm. Since it occurs more commonly in primigravidae and in women with underlying collagen-vascular diseases, an immunological component has long been suspected. Increased prevalence in high-order and molar pregnancies and those associated with increased placental mass suggests that trophoblastic volume and fetal antigen load are correlated with the syndrome. Epidemiological reports indicate that the prevalence of preeclampsia is decreased in women who received heterologous blood transfusions, practiced oral sex, or when a long period of cohabitation preceded an established pregnancy. Conversely, the use of condoms as a primary mode of contraception is associated with a higher risk of preeclampsia. These studies suggest that prior exposure to foreign or paternal antigens imparts a protection against the likelihood of developing preeclampsia. Clinical evidence of cellular and humoral immune dysfunction is associated with the syndrome. Fibrin and complement deposition and ""foam"" cells in atherosis lesions resemble the histopathology of renal allograft rejection. Relative T-cell, natural killer cell, and neutrophil activation have been reported in preeclampsia and circulating cytokines and antiphospholipid antibodies are more prevalent in preeclampsia than in normal pregnant women. These abnormalities are consistent with the systemic endothelial cell dysfunction that has been postulated as a pathophysiological feature of preeclampsia. While such associations do not prove causality, they suggest testable hypotheses for continued basic and clinical investigation of this major complication of human pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia-eclampsia is still one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.

Despite improved prenatal care, severe preeclampsia and eclampsia still occur. Although understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders has improved, treatment has not changed significantly in over 50 years. Although postponement of delivery in selected women with severe preeclampsia improves fetal outcome to a degree, this is not done without risk to the mother.

Severe preeclampsia may be managed expectantly, in selected cases. The objective of expectant management in these patients is to improve neonatal outcome. Expectant management is based on antihypertensive treatment and prevention of end organ dysfunction. Antihypertensive treatment improves maternal outcome but has the potential to be deleterious for the foetus. Plasma volume expansion has been suggested for severe preeclampsia but trials failed to show any benefit. Magnesium sulfate is the anticonvulsivant of choice to treat or prevent eclampsia when indicated. Antenatal corticosteroids are recommended in severely preeclamptic women with 26-34 weeks gestation. Timing of delivery is based upon gestational age, severity of preeclampsia, maternal and foetal risks.",preeclampsia
"Background: Since the early 1980s, epidemiological evidence has suggested a connection between low calcium intake and preeclampsia The purpose of this meta-analysis is to summarize current evidence regarding calcium supplementation during pregnancy in predicting preeclampsia and associated maternal-fetal complications. Methods: Literature revision of all RCT (random allocation of calcium versus placebo) available in MEDLINE/PUBMED up to 2/29/2012 regarding calcium supplementation during pregnancy for preventing preeclampsia. We used the Mantel-Haenszel's Method for four subgroup of patients: Adequate calcium intake; Low calcium intake; Low risk of preeclampsia; High risk of preeclampsia. We considered p < 0.05 as significant. Results: There is no consensus in Literature about: (1) the efficacy of calcium supplementation in the prevention of preeclampsia, (2) other/adverse/long-term effects of calcium supplementation in pregnancy. Conclusions: Preeclampsia is likely to be a multifactorial disease. However, inadequate calcium intake represents a factor associated with an increased incidence of hypertensive disease. The results of our meta-analysis demonstrate that the additional intake of calcium during pregnancy is an effective measure to reduce the incidence of preeclampsia, especially in populations at high risk of preeclampsia due to ethnicity, gender, age, high BMI and in those with low baseline calcium intake.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy related condition identified by hypertension and either proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction after 20(th) week of gestation and complicates 2-8% pregnancies worldwide. Enigmatic pathophysiology and multi-system involvement hinder accurate identification and clinical management of patients. Inadequate trophoblast invasion and subsequent inflammatory response have been implicated in the onset of PE. In absence of effective treatment of preeclampsia except delivery, recent research has been focused on identification of specific and sensitive biomarkers for early prediction of PE. Several angiogenic, anti-angiogenic, inflammatory, biophysical (mean arterial pressure and uterine artery Doppler) biomarkers, alone and in combination, have been proposed for prediction but limited predictive values have hindered their use in clinical settings. Current review summarizes some of relatively new biomarkers such as corin, copeptin, microparticles and miRNA, the prognostic efficiency of which are either analyzed in associated disorders or recently discovered.",preeclampsia
"Prompt hospitalization is the optimum management of all patients with preeclampsia. Expectant management is possible in most patients remote from term. The success rate of expectant management will depend on both fetal gestational age and the state to which the disease has progressed at the time of hospitalization. Maternal and perinatal complications are increased significantly in patients with severe preeclampsia and in those with the HELLP syndrome. Thus, these patients should be managed only at tertiary care centers.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific syndrome of hypertension and proteinuria, is one of the leading causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Although the initiating factor is unknown, a clearer picture regarding the network mechanisms of preeclampsia has begun to emerge during the past few years. The pathogenesis of preeclampsia can be described as having two stages. The first stage of preeclampsia involves abnormal placental implantation, followed by transition to the second stage of endothelial dysfunction. The link bridging these two stages is considered to be oxidative stress and disrupting angiogenesis. Discovery of the fundamental molecular mechanisms causing preeclampsia may provide a potential for prophylactic intervention and symptom amelioration. In this article, the clinical syndrome and risk factors of preeclampsia will be introduced, followed by the recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and, finally, research into aberrant placentation will be discussed.",preeclampsia
"The immune maladaptation hypothesis of preeclampsia is concordant with cytokine-mediated oxidative stress, chronology of endothelial activation, lipid changes, adverse effect of changing partners, and the protective effect of sperm exposure. Genetic factors may involve underlying hereditary thrombophilic disorders and hyperhomocysteinemia, essential hypertension and/or obesity, or control of the Th1/Th2 balance and thus affect the maternal response against fetal antigens. Placental ischemia and increased syncytiotrophoblast deportation are probably end-stage disease phenomena.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a common complication of pregnancy associated with high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality especially in developing countries. There is considerable progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology and the management of the diseases, although the aetiology and primary pathology remained elusive. Integration of current evidence in the clinical management of the condition has witnessed improved maternal and fetal outcomes in many societies. In developing countries variations in management often not based on current evidence accounts for comparatively higher morbidity and mortality. This article aims to provide an overview of our present understanding of preeclampsia help care providers and our managers focus practice and policy to reflect existing evidence.",preeclampsia
"The complicated preeclamptic patient represents a challenge for the clinician faced with her antepartum or postpartum care. The most serious sequelae of preeclampsia account for a significant portion of maternal morbidity and mortality. Severe preeclampsia also results in an appreciable portion of perinatal morbidity and mortality. In this review, developing trends in the treatment of severe preeclampsia are discussed. Expectant treatment of the patient remote from term, anesthesia choices, and delivery route are reviewed. Developing trends in the pharmacological approach to complicated preeclampsia are discussed. New concepts in the treatment of cerebrovascular preeclampsia and hepatic rupture are outlined and reviewed.",preeclampsia
"In this review, the various biochemical tests that have been proposed for the prediction of preeclampsia are described and evaluated. Placenta hormone markers do not predict future disease. They denounce the early placental changes that are part of the evolving disease and only predict the imminent of preeclamptic syndrome. This explains why tests are better predictors when preeclampsia supervenes shortly, and why screening in the first trimester is unlikely to work as well as in the second trimester. The use of multiple markers in the screening should reflect different aspects of the disease process and could increase the specificity and sensitivity of the screening and work on different etiologic factors. The possible use of second-trimester biochemical screening to predict the risk of preeclampsia remains to be investigated in the high-risk population. Target audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians Learning objectives: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to list the various theories on the etiology of preeclampsia, to relate the various risk factors for the development of preeclampsia, and to describe the various screening tests for preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a leading cause of pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality in the United States. In the past 30 years, a large amount of research has been performed to investigate the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of preeclampsia, ways to treat preeclampsia, markers that can be used to predict preeclampsia, and associations with other factors, such as smoking, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. Preeclampsia has been characterized by some investigators into 2 different disease entities: early-onset preeclampsia and late-onset preeclampsia. Early-onset preeclampsia is usually defined as preeclampsia that develops before 34 weeks of gestation, whereas late-onset preeclampsia develops at or after 34 weeks of gestation. Although the presenting features overlap, they are associated with different maternal and fetal outcomes, biochemical markers, heritability, and clinical features. To date, no review has analyzed the data focusing on early- versus late-onset preeclampsia. This review summarizes the relevant research on the similarities and differences between early- and late-onset preeclampsia as it relates to pathogenesis and biomarkers, including differences in vascular endothelial growth factor, placental growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, vascular cell adhesion molecule, toll-like receptor, plasma pentraxin 3, soluble endoglin, and lipid peroxidation. Although many articles have been published regarding these 2 entities, more data regarding differences and similarities between the 2 are clearly needed. Such study should permit more effective diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients with preeclampsia. Target audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists and Family Physicians Learning Objectives: After the completing the CME activity, physicians should be better able to evaluate the role of abnormal placentation in preeclampsia. Develop a protocol for researching biomarkers relevant to early-onset and late-onset preeclampsia. To distinguish the biomarkers that are similar and different in early-onset and late-onset preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a progressive multisystem disorder that is exclusive to human pregnancy and defined as new hypertension presenting after 20 weeks with significant proteinuria. It is a multifactorial condition with a strong genetic component and several genes have been linked with this disorder. The main players implicated in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia include immune maladaptation, hemodynamics, endothelial function, thrombophilic disorders, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism. All of these mechanisms encompass genetic factors that might be responsible for the pathogenic changes taking place. Pre-eclampsia has been referred to as a primipaternity disease. A number of studies examined the contribution of paternal genes in pre-eclampsia. Although there is evidence that paternal genes significantly increase the risk of pre-eclampsia, there is still inconclusive evidence whether having the same partner is a protective factor. Gene expression, through imprinting and epistasis, also play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Pre-eclampsia remains a disease of theories. Despite the growing body of research exploring this complex disorder, the etiology of pre-eclampsia remains elusive and the struggle is still ongoing to find an effective predictive test that can detect this disorder at an early stage where intervention can prevent the progression of the disorder. Research is still ongoing. Prevention and early detection of pre-eclampsia remain the ultimate goal.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a 2-stage disorder. Stage 1 is decreased placental perfusion and generates stage 2 of the disorder, the maternal syndrome characteristic of preeclampsia. How the 2 stages are linked has been a topic of intense investigation for many years. One candidate phenomenon, which includes many other suggested linkages, is oxidative stress. This hypothesis predicts that the administration of antioxidants would decrease oxidative stress and modify stage 2. Experience with the treatment of preeclampsia including a small trial of antioxidants in women with manifest preeclampsia makes it clear that the use of any therapy once preeclampsia is evident will not be successful. Trials evaluating prophylactic aspirin and supplemental calcium from early pregnancy suggest that therapy before evident preeclampsia may be successful in selected populations. Guided by these concepts and by experience with antioxidant therapy in other settings, 1 small study (<80 women in the treatment arm) was very encouraging with an almost two-thirds reduction of the frequency of preeclampsia in high-risk women. Antioxidants currently are being evaluated in several larger trials in the United States, Canada, Mexico, England, and in several developing nations. These studies should definitively establish the efficacy and safety of this therapy for the mother and fetus.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To document the diversity of definitions and diagnoses of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy reported in major medical journals as a preliminary step from which future documents may be developed concerning the classification and diagnosis of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Methods: A systematic review was undertaken of articles published between 1997 and 1998 researching ""preeclampsia"" in nine internationally recognized journals. Each article was assessed to establish the features used by the authors to define preeclampsia and its major defining variables (i.e., proteinuria and hypertension). Documentation of aspects of the blood pressure measurement technique was also noted. Results: One hundred thirty-five articles were studied, demonstrating a wide variety in the authors' definitions of preeclampsia, ""significant"" proteinuria, and hypertension. In up to 13% of articles, one or more of these terms was not defined and documentation of the blood pressure measurement technique was generally poor. The diversity of reporting was of such magnitude that the groups of women in these studies could rarely be considered truly comparable. Conclusion: Scientific and clinical research groups are studying different preeclamptic groups as a result of using different definitions of this condition. As comparison of results among studies is fundamental to the correct elucidation of knowledge about preeclampsia, standardization of the classification and diagnostic criteria of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy should be a major priority of societies devoted to the study of these disorders.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, which account for approximately 15% of pregnancy-related deaths, represent the second-leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. New classifications recommended by the National Institutes of Health's Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy have decreased the confusion often associated with these disorders. The cause of preeclampsia-eclampsia still remains elusive, but continued research has provided hope with regard to screening, improved diagnosis, and management. Risk factors that have recently gained attention include inherited thrombophilias, inherited metabolic disorders, and lipid disorders. Treatment and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have not changed substantially in the past 50 years. Prevention of preeclampsia-eclampsia has been unsuccessful, and recurrence risks remain high. Careful diagnosis, classification, and further investigation of the causes of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are needed to achieve optimal management of affected women and their fetuses.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia and chronic hypertension with superimposed pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia complicates about 3% of pregnancies, and all hypertensive disorders affect about five to 10% of pregnancies. Secular increases in chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia have occurred as a result of changes in maternal characteristics (such as maternal age and pre-pregnancy weight), whereas declines in eclampsia have followed widespread antenatal care and use of prophylactic treatments (such as magnesium sulphate). Determinants of pre-eclampsia rates include a bewildering array of risk and protective factors, including familial factors, sperm exposure, maternal smoking, pre-existing medical conditions (such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and anti-phospholipid syndrome), and miscellaneous ones such as plurality, older maternal age and obesity. Hypertensive disorders are associated with higher rates of maternal, fetal and infant mortality, and severe morbidity, especially in cases of severe pre-eclampsia, eclampsia and haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets syndrome.",preeclampsia
"Inadequate trophoblast invasion of the spiral arteries in early pregnancy, an increased inflammatory response and changes in the immune answer to paternal antigens are considered aetiological factors in preeclampsia. Searching for factors related to these angiogenic, anti-angiogenic, immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms may provide methods to determine which patient will develop preeclampsia predating the onset of the clinical manifestations of the disease. Screening for preeclampsia in the first trimester has had Limited success. Currently, maternal characteristics, clinical history, maternal serum biochemistry and uterine artery Doppler sonography before 14 weeks are being investigated. Preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy is still the strongest predictor. In the second trimester, uterine artery Doppler has a detection rate around 60% but also a high false positive rate of 25%. First trimester uterine artery Doppler studies have high sensitivity but poor specificity with a high false positive rate. Combination of first trimester uterine artery Doppler with patient characteristics and maternal serum biochemistry, specifically placental protein 13 holds promise but further evaluation is needed. Maternal serum markers including inhibin A, activin A, soluble FMS-Like tyrosine kinase 1, endoglin, pregnancy associated plasma protein A and others, when used alone have proved poor predictors of preeclampsia. Most studies have been performed by a limited group of researchers in a population with a high risk and no validation studies of any method in other populations are available. Results are difficult to compare due to differences in methodology, and differences in the end point studied.There are still no good methods of preventing preeclampsia once a high risk has been determined.",preeclampsia
Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity/mortality. The pathogenesis of preeclampsia is still under investigation. The aim of this paper is to present the molecular mechanisms implicating in the pathway leading to preeclampsia.,preeclampsia
"It has been widely thought that the effects of hypertension in pregnancy reversed after delivery and hypertension values returned to their pre-pregnancy level as it was seen as a disease of short duration in otherwise healthy young women. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the principal underlying abnormality, endothelial dysfunction, remains in women who had preeclampsia and that it is this damage that increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in later life. The contributions of hypertension and dyslipidaemia before and during the pregnancy are also important and contribute to future risk. Serum lipids are complex and change dramatically in pregnancy. In general there is an increase in most plasma lipid components, notably triglycerides, total cholesterol and the major particles of HDL and LDL. Aberrations or exaggerations in this shift (i.e. decrease HDL and a greater increase in LDL) are associated with poor outcomes of pregnancy such as preeclampsia. Long term cardiovascular disease is influenced by preeclampsia and in part potentially by the lipid changes which escalate late in disease. Whether we can influence the risk of preeclampsia by controlling cardiovascular risk factors preceding or during preeclampsia, or cardiovascular disease after preeclampsia is yet to be determined. Ultimately, strategies to control lipid concentrations will only be viable when we understand the safety to the mother at the time of the pregnancy, and to the foetus both immediately and in the very long term. Strategies to control blood pressure are well established in the non-pregnant population, and previous preeclampsia and gestational hypertension should be considered in any cardiovascular risk profile. Whether control of blood pressure in the pregnancy per se is of any longer term benefit is also yet to be determined.",preeclampsia
"This month, the focus is on preeclampsia and specifically emphasizes three areas: prediction, clinical management, and long-term sequelae. The current reviews serve to highlight the increasing importance of this disease across the health care continuum. The complete reference for each article reviewed can be found in on this page, along with direct links to the abstracts.",preeclampsia
"In recent years, an increasing amount of literature is emerging on candidate urine and blood-based biomarkers associated with incidence and severity of preeclampsia (PE) in pregnant women. While enthusiasm on the usefulness of several of these markers in predicting PE is evolving, essentially all work so far has focused on the needs of high-resource settings and high-income countries, resulting primarily in multi-parameter laboratory assays based on proteomic and metabolomics analysis techniques. These highly complex methods, however, require laboratory capabilities that are rarely available or affordable in low-resource settings (LRS). The importance of quantifying maternal and perinatal risks and identifying which pregnancies can be safely prolonged is also much greater in LRS, where intensive care facilities that can rapidly respond to PE-related health threats for women and infants are limited. For these reasons, simple, low cost, sensitive, and specific point-of-care (POC) tests are needed that can be performed by antenatal health care providers in LRS and that can facilitate decisions about detection and management of PE. Our study aims to provide a comprehensive systematic review of current and emerging blood and urine biomarkers for PE, not only on the basis of their clinical performance, but also of their suitability to be used in LRS-compatible test formats, such as lateral flow and other variants of POC rapid assays.",preeclampsia
"Infrequently, severe preeclampsia-eclampsia with or without HELLP syndrome persists more than 24 to 48 hours into the postpartum period. Maternal morbidity and mortality is increased in these women who persist in their disease and do not rapidly resolve their hypertension, decreased urinary output, depressed platelet count, and other related abnormalities within 72 to 96 hours postpartum. When these worsen to include multiple system organ failure, infection, and fibrin consumption coagulation disorders, emergent and aggressive intervention is needed. Prophylactic treatment options to accelerate postpartum recovery include ultrasound-directed postpartum curettage and oral nifedipine therapy. In pregnancies complicated by HELLP syndrome, postpartum corticosteroids can be used to hasten the recovery from this disease. Delayed ultrasound-directed curettage and exchange plasmapheresis with fresh-frozen plasma can be used in pregnancies when evidence of recovery is absent or further deterioration is evident by 96 hours postpartum. Other specific system involvement, such as central nervous system or renal system, requires directed therapy unique to the individual condition and patient that is undertaken in association with consultants.",preeclampsia
"Purpose of review: Recent literature on the role of transthoracic echocardiography in the management of women with preeclampsia is reviewed with emphasis on recommendations for its use in the life-threatening complications of acute pulmonary edema, chest pain, and hemorrhage. Recent findings: The diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia are closer to reaching international consensus with most guidelines now removing the mandatory requirement for proteinuria. Hemodynamic findings using transthoracic echocardiography in women with untreated preeclampsia include normal or increased cardiac output, normal or increased contractility, a nondilated left ventricle, diastolic dysfunction, increased pericardial effusions, and increased left ventricular mass. Echocardiography is recommended as a diagnostic and monitoring tool for acute hemodynamic complications of preeclampsia, such as acute pulmonary edema, significant arterial hypertension, and chest pain. Despite this there has been limited uptake of transthoracic electrocardiography into routine clinical practice in women with preeclampsia. Summary: The role of transthoracic echocardiography in the management of women with preeclampsia is emphasized by international groups. Research into the hemodynamics in preeclampsia, which demonstrates preserved ejection fraction, and diastolic dysfunction highlights its utility and acceptability by pregnant women with preeclampsia. Training of obstetric anesthesiologists in echocardiography is necessary to enable more widespread implementation of this important technology.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia has traditionally been viewed as one of several forms of hypertension complicating pregnancy. More recently, the multisystem nature of this unique gestational disorder has been emphasized. Pathophysiologic events, including abnormal placentation and heightened vascular reactivity, may occur weeks or months prior to clinical recognition of the disease. Although most frequently presenting as hypertension and proteinuria, hepatic (abdominal pain and elevation of transaminases) and hematologic (intravascular hemolysis and thrombocytopenia) involvement may be important features of the disease. Current theories suggest that multiorgan dysfunction may be caused by widespread vascular endothelial dysfunction, vasospasm, and variable activation of coagulation mechanisms. Pending delivery, which is the only definitive therapy for preeclampsia, maternal complications of intracerebral hemorrhage and eclampsia may be prevented with judicious use of antihypertensive medication (e.g., hydralazine) and magnesium sulfate, respectively. Finally, data from a number of small trials suggest that low-dose aspirin (60-100 mg/d) may reduce the incidence of preeclampsia in patients at high risk without adversely affecting the fetus or newborn; however, it is recommended that aspirin not be used as a routine prophylactic intervention until publication of results of several ongoing large multicenter trials, which will help to more fully clarify the benefits and risks of this approach.",preeclampsia
"Although there is substantial evidence that preeclampsia has a genetic background, the complexity of the processes involved and the fact that preeclampsia is a maternal-fetal phenomenon does not make the search for the molecular basis of preeclampsia genes easy. It is possible that the single phenotype 'preeclampsia' in fact should be divided into different sub-groups on genetic or biochemical level. In the present review, the preeclampsia phenotype and its pathophysiologic features are discussed. Family studies and postulated inheritance models are summarized. A systematic overview is given on the numerous candidate gene studies and gene-expression studies performed so far and on the currently available genome-wide scan data. Despite extensive research the molecular genetic basis of preeclampsia remains unclear. Future studies will hopefully enhance our insights in the molecular pathogenesis of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"In the present study, the impact of the potential perinatal epidemiological factors on preeclampsia development was assessed. This clinical study included 55 pregnant women with preeclampsia and control group of 50 healthy pregnant women. Positive family history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or thromboembolic disease was recorded in 50% of women with preeclampsia versus 28% of control group women. Positive personal history of this disease was recorded in 15% of women with preeclampsia, whereas all control group women had negative personal history of preeclampsia. Dietary habits, i.e. the intake of meat and meat products, fruit and vegetables, coffee and alcohol drinks were similar in the two groups, without statistically significant differences. The women with preeclampsia and control women reported comparable habits; there was no difference in the consumption of meat, fruit, vegetables, coffee and alcohol, smoking, use of folate and oral hormonal contraception before pregnancy, or in physical activity as the potential risk factors for preeclampsia in current pregnancy. However, personal and family history of vascular disease proved to be significant risk factors for the occurrence of preeclampsia, emphasizing the need of lifestyle and dietary modifications with healthy dietary habits, while avoiding adverse habits in pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-associated disease with maternal symptoms, but placental origin. Although clinical symptoms are late, systemic and maternal, the origin of preeclampsia is early, local and placental. Despite that various protein biomarkers display changed levels in maternal serum at presymptomatic stages, they lack discriminative and predictive power in individual patients. In contrast to protein markers, placental RNA analyzed in maternal plasma permits rapid screening of novel biomarkers including markers not accessible by antibody based assays. This includes transcription factors, non-coding RNA, epigenetic features, as well as genes functionally or genetically linked with preeclampsia. By reviewing genes with placental expression in the Human SymAtlas and comparison with proven qualifiers, a large set of RNA biomarkers was targeted for use in maternal plasma. These biomarkers qualify as novel RNA biomarkers for the presymptomatic detection in first trimester of pregnancy-associated diseases with placental origin and/or dysfunction such as pregnancy-induced hypertension without or with proteinuria (preeclampsia), the HELLP syndrome, and intrauterine growth restriction.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia is the major problem and the main leading cause of fetal and maternal mortality worldwide. The early prediction of preeclampsia in pregnant women is required to prevent the occurrence of preeclampsia. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and roll-over test (ROT) are the combination of measurement which can be used to predict preeclampsia. On the contrary, Ajwa dates were reported to have an enormous activity which contributes to its role in improving health conditions. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of daily consumption of seven Ajwa dates on prevention of preeclampsia, through MAP and ROT changes. Methods: Forty pregnant women (n = 40) were randomly assigned into the control group (n = 10) and the intervention group which received a daily intake of Ajwa dates (n = 30). The MAP and ROT were assessed before and after the 8-week intervention period. Results: The intervention group showed the significant reduction in MAP and ROT following the 8-week intervention period (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Daily consumption of seven Ajwa dates has a remarkable potential to decrease the MAP and ROT in pregnant women at risk of developing preeclampsia, and thus, it can contribute to prevent the development of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia (PE) is a multisystem disease characterized by the development of hypertension and proteinuria. Although PE etiology is not fully known, the placenta seems to play a central role in the development of disease. The inadequate placentation process results in a change in angiogenic factors levels, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble form of endoglin (s-Eng) and soluble form of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 1 (sFlt-1). Objective: The aim of this review was to clarify if the imbalance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors is associated with PE. Conclusion: It is known that inadequate placentation process is the primary mechanism suggested for PE occurrence and angiogenic factors are involved in this process. The state-of-the-art suggests that progress in grasp the imbalance of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors is essential for the improvement of knowledge about PE. The development of prospective, longitudinal studies with serial determinations of these factors throughout pregnancy is needed to better assess the relevance of these markers for understanding the etiology, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of this challenging disease.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-related disease afflicting 3-7% of pregnancies worldwide and leads to maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. The disease is of placental origin and is commonly described as a disease of two stages. A variety of preeclampsia animal models have been proposed, but all of them have limitations in fully recapitulating the human disease. Based on the research question at hand, different or multiple models might be suitable. Multiple animal models in combination with in vitro or ex vivo studies on human placenta together offer a synergistic platform to further our understanding of the etiology of preeclampsia and potential therapeutic interventions. The described animal models of preeclampsia divide into four categories (i) spontaneous, (ii) surgically induced, (iii) pharmacologically/substance induced, and (iv) transgenic. This review aims at providing an inventory of novel models addressing etiology of the disease and or therapeutic/intervention opportunities.",preeclampsia
"Due to the high risk of morbidity and mortality from unrecognized and untreated pre-eclampsia, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion to evaluate, treat and monitor patients presenting with signs concerning for pre-eclampsia. Early blood pressure management and seizure prophylaxis during labor are critical for maternal safety. Intrapartum, special anesthetic considerations should be employed to ensure the safety of the parturient and fetus. Patients who have pre-eclampsia should be aware that they are at high risk for the future development of cardiovascular disease.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy, which is the cause of 60 000 maternal deaths annually worldwide. In addition to the well-known maternal risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, obesity, aging, and multiple pregnancies, recent studies have identified the role of genetic and immunological factors in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. In particular, imbalance between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors, anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor antibodies and dysregulation of oxygen supplies can cause preeclampsia. A group of biomarkers have been introduced for diagnosis of preeclampsia. Chief among them is the ratio of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 to placental growth factor, which can be used in clinical practice. Recent studies have shown high specificity and sensitivity of these markers for early diagnosis of preeclampsia, which is critical for prevention of fetal and maternal complications.",preeclampsia
"The past decade saw the advent of a number of promising biomarkers to detect pregnancies at risk for preeclampsia (PE), the foremost being those associated with an imbalance of angiogenic factors. In late pregnancy, these are useful for the detection of imminent cases of PE, while earlier they were more predictive for early- than late-onset PE. This suggests that there may be fundamental differences between the underlying pathology of these two PE forms. Therefore, it is possible that such a biological premise may limit the development of biomarkers that will permit the efficacious detection of both early- and late-onset PE via an analysis of first-trimester maternal blood samples. Consequently, a significant increase in our understanding of the underlying pathology of PE, using a variety of approaches ranging from systems biology to animal models, will be necessary in order to overcome this obstacle.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a disease characterized by hypertension and proteinuria in the third trimester of pregnancy. Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal mortality, and fetal death, especially in developing countries, but its aetiology remains unclear. Key findings support a causal role of superficial placentation driven by immune mal maladaptation, which then lead to reduced concentrations of angiogenic growth factors and to an increase in placental debris in the maternal circulation resulting in a maternal inflammatory response. Epidemiological research has consistently demonstrated a substantial familial predisposition to preeclampsia. Unfortunately, the conquest of the genes explaining such a individual susceptibility has been proved to be a hard task. However, genetics will also inform us about causality of environmental factors, and then serve as a tool to prioritize therapeutic targets for preventive strategies.",preeclampsia
"Segregation of preeclampsia into early-onset, placental and late-onset, maternal subtypes along with the acknowledgement of the contribution of epigenetics in placentally expressed genes proved to be a key first step in the identification of essential gene variants associated with preeclampsia. Application of this insight to other populations and related pregnancy-induced syndromes, such as HELLP, and acknowledgment of the features shared between chromosomal loci associated with preeclampsia in different populations provide the rationale for new strategies for the identification of susceptibility genes and for new and more effective diagnostic strategies.",preeclampsia
"On September 21 and 22, 2006, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development of the National Institutes of Health sponsored a 2-day workshop titled ""Preeclampsia--A Pressing Problem."" The purpose of the workshop was to bring together leaders in the field to present and discuss their diverse research areas, which ranged from basic science to clinical trials and management, and to identify scientific gaps. This article is a summary of the proceedings of that workshop. Although much progress is being made in understanding the underpinnings of preeclampsia, a number of research gaps are identified that, if filled, would hasten progress in the field. It is the overall consensus that preeclampsia is a multifactorial disease whose pathogenesis is not solely vascular, genetic, immunologic, or environmental but a complex combination of factors. In addition, a number of specific scientific gaps are identified including insufficient multidisciplinary and collaborative research, clinical trials and studies of patient management, and a lack of in-depth mechanistic research. The research community needs to focus on these gaps to better understand the disease, with the ultimate goal of preventing the disorder.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a complex multisystem disorder exclusively seen in human species that is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. This disorder has the highest maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality of all pregnancy-related complications. Growing evidence suggests that placental oxidative stress is involved in the etiopathogenesis of preeclampsia. Reduced perfusion as a result of abnormal placentation leads to ischemia reperfusion injury to the placenta. Placental oxidative stress, which results from the ischemia reperfusion injury, is being increasingly reported to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of preeclampsia. It has been proposed as a promoter of lipid peroxidation and the endothelial cell dysfunction that is commonly seen in this condition. Although preeclampsia is characterized by increased lipid peroxidation and diminished antioxidant capacity, there is no consensus regarding causality of lipid peroxidation in preeclampsia. In this article, we address the question of the biologic association of lipid peroxidation and preeclampsia. Lipid peroxidation and leukocyte activation may play a pivotal role in endothelial cell dysfunction. We also review the different factors that have been proposed to cause endothelial cell dysfunction in preeclampsia, trials investigating the role of antioxidant supplementation in preeclampsia, and the lack of consensus among the trials. Additional longitudinal studies are necessary to determine if the various oxidative stress biomarkers estimated early in pregnancy can be narrowed to a single marker for predicting preeclampsia. Target audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians. Learning objectives: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to recall that placental oxidative stress is involved in the etiopathogenesis of preeclampsia, state that placental oxidative stress results from ischemic reperfusion injury, and explain that ischemic reperfusion injury is a promoter of lipid peroxidation and endothelial cell dysfunction seen in preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"In this speculative paper, I consider the relationship between oxidative stress and the evolution of placentation in eutherian mammals. I argue that epitheliochorial placentation, in which fetal tissues remain separated from maternal blood throughout gestation, has evolved as a protective mechanism against oxidative stress arising from pregnancy, particularly in species with unusually long gestation periods and unusually large placentas. Human beings comprise an unusual species that has the life history characteristics of an epitheliochorial species, but exhibits hemochorial placentation, in which fetal tissues come into direct contact with maternal blood. I argue that the risk of preeclampsia has arisen as a consequence of the failure of human beings to evolve epitheliochorial placentation.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: Review of public health perspectives of preeclampsia in developing countries and implications for health system strengthening. Methods: Literature from Pubmed (MEDLINE), AJOL, Google Scholar, and Cochrane database were reviewed. Results: The prevalence of preeclampsia in developing countries ranges from 1.8% to 16.7%. Many challenges exist in the prediction, prevention, and management of preeclampsia. Promising prophylactic measures like low-dose aspirin and calcium supplementation need further evidence before recommendation for use in developing countries. Treatment remains prenatal care, timely diagnosis, proper management, and timely delivery. Prevailing household, community, and health system factors limiting effective control of preeclampsia in these countries were identified, and strategies to strengthen health systems were highlighted. Conclusion: Overcoming the prevailing challenges in the control of preeclampsia in developing countries hinges on the ability of health care systems to identify and manage women at high risk.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a devastating complication of pregnancy which is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria in pregnant women. Pre-eclampsia is important as it is the leading cause of death. Moreover, untreated pre-eclampsia might lead to other lethal complications, for both fetus and mother. Pre-eclampsia can also affect the quality of life in affected women. Despite a large number of risk factors for pre-eclampsia, these risk factors are able to detect just 30% of women who are susceptible to pre-eclampsia. Heterogeneous manifestations of pre-eclampsia necessitate the discovery of potential biomarkers required for its early detection. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of RNA which are more abundant, specific, and highly organized compared with other types of RNA. Accordingly, circRNAs have been suggested as one of the potential biomarkers for different diseases. Recently, researchers have shown interest in the effects of circRNAs in pre-eclampsia, although the current evidence is limited. The majority of obstetricians are probably not aware of circRNAs as a useful biomarker. Here, we aimed to summarize recent supporting evidence and assess the mechanisms by which circRNAs are involved in pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Abnormal placental implantation presumed to be secondary to maternal genetic susceptibility or immune maladaptation is considered to be fundamental to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. The reduced placental perfusion resulting in placental ischemia is hypothesized to cause the known endothelial dysfunction, which leads to the clinical manifestations of this disease. Oxidative stress is a postulated linking factor, an aberration that possibly has its genesis via cytokines released from the abnormally implanted and perfused placenta. Clearly the maternal pathophysiologic changes that subsequently produce what is recognized as preeclampsia are present long before the disease makes its clinical appearance.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive disorders related to pregnancy and particularly preeclampsia are leading reasons for perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. The symptoms of preeclampsia are occurring during the second part of pregnancy, while the pathogenic processes start developing even in first trimester. This refers to the searching for the most reliable markers, that could prove those pathological processes happened and the combination of those markers in panel for early screening in order to predict the increased risk for developing of preeclampsia. Among multiple studied markers the most promising seam to be Doppler velosimetry of uterine arteries, PIGF, sFlt-1, sEndoglin, PAPP-A, PP-13. Their combined measurement increases the predictive rate and decreases the false positive results, but is also economically irrelevant. There are researches with different medications in order to argue their preventive effect in preeclampsia developing.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is defined as gestational hypertension plus proteinuria (≥ 300 mg/day). It is a common disorder during pregnancy, accounting for about 20% of fetal mortality occurring after the 20th week of gestation. Preeclampsia is considered severe when it involves severe gestational hypertension and/or proteinuria ≥ 5 g/day, or when it is associated with pulmonary edema, oliguria, thrombocytopenia, elevation of liver enzymes, or involvement of the central nervous system. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is at present considered one of the predisposing conditions for the occurrence of severe preeclampsia. This review provides an update of the best available treatments to prevent the evolution of APS towards severe preeclampsia. The proposed pharmacological approach, based on the use of low-dose salicylate alone or combined with low molecular-weight heparin, is titrated against different subsets of clinical and laboratory data. Thorough treatment and close surveillance of patients suffering from APS during pregnancy requires the expertise of a joint team consisting of gynecologists, neonatal doctors, nephrologists, anesthesiologists, and rheumatologists.",preeclampsia
"Various hypotheses as to the origin of preeclampsia have been explored over time. Diseases of pregnancy are difficult to study for several reasons. One limitation is due to the fact that preeclampsia and associated diseases clinically present in the second and third trimenon, but seem to originate early in pregnancy. Comparisons with animal models are difficult due to the unique human nature of the disease. The creation of new methods including proteomics, genomics, lipidomics, metabolomics or mRNA microarray techniques supplement the traditional type of research access to approach mother and fetus. The clinical course will be discussed and pregnancy-related processes, which are thought to contribute to the disease. This includes implantation of the placenta/fetus, the adaptation of the endothelial activity to the pregnancy with respect to relaxin, matrix metalloproteinases and endothelin, nitric oxide, angiogenetic factors and TGF-b in normal and preeclamptic pregnancies. Furthermore, oxidative stress, genetics and hypothesis-generating molecular approaches are considered.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) represent 10% of human births globally and the major complication preeclampsia has a 3-5% prevalence. The etiology of HDP remains uncertain; however, major advances have been made over the last 25 years. The Seventh International Workshop on Reproductive Immunology, Immunological Tolerance and Immunology of Preeclampsia 2010 celebrated its 12th Anniversary in Tioman Island in 2010. Over this period, these seven workshops have contributed extensively to immunological, epidemiological, anthropological, and even vascular debates. The defect of trophoblastic invasion encountered in preeclampsia, intra-uterine growth restriction, and to some extent preterm labor, was understood only at the end of the 1970s. On the other hand, clinical and epidemiological findings at the end of the 20th century permitted us to apprehend that ""preeclampsia, the disease of primiparae"" may well be a disease of first pregnancy for a couple. Among the important advances, reproductive immunology is certainly the topic where knowledge has exploded in the last decade. This paper relates some major steps in the comprehension of this disease and provides a review of epidemiological studies on the ""primipaternity paradigm"". It focuses on the relevance of new developments and new concepts in immunology. At the beginning of the 21st century we are possibly closer than ever to understanding the etiology of this obstetrical enigma and also the pathophysiology of global endothelial inflammation in preeclamptic women. In this quest, reproductive immunology will certainly emerge as one of the main players.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a disorder that uniquely affects pregnancy and profoundly alters the short- and long-term health of the mother and fetus. The pathophysiologic processes that underlie preeclampsia can be thought of in two stages: stage 1, reduced placental perfusion, and stage 2, the maternal clinical syndrome. Multiple pathophysiologic processes influence stage one, affecting trophoblast invasion and placental function. These processes in some women result in stage two, with subsequent maternal inflammatory, metabolic, and thrombotic responses, converging to alter vascular and endothelial health. An increasingly comprehensive understanding of these factors is emerging, which we will introduce in this chapter and which will be detailed in the chapters that follow. The translation of this understanding into clinical trials and ultimately into effective preventive and therapeutic measures remains the ultimate goal of preeclampsia research.",preeclampsia
"Problem: Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific hypertensive syndrome, is one of the leading causes of premature births as well as fetal and maternal death. Preeclampsia lacks effective therapies because of the poor understanding of disease pathogenesis. The aim of this paper is to review molecular signaling pathways that could be responsible for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Method of study: This article reviews the English-language literature for pathogenesis and pathophysiological mechanisms of preeclampsia based on genome-wide gene expression profiling and proteomic studies. Results: We show that the expression of the genes and proteins involved in response to stress, host-pathogen interactions, immune system, inflammation, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, growth and tissue remodeling was increased in preeclampsia. Several significant common pathways observed in preeclampsia overlap the datasets identified in TLR (Toll-like receptor)- and RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products)-dependent signaling pathways. Placental oxidative stress and subsequent chronic inflammation are considered to be major contributors to the development of preeclampsia. Conclusion: This review summarizes recent advances in TLR- and RAGE-mediated signaling and the target molecules, and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy characterized by hypertension, edema and proteinuria, beginning after 20 weeks of gestation. Six percent of the pregnant women in North America develop this disease, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality for the mother and her baby. The physiopathology remains uncertain despite many research efforts. Actual hypotheses seek to explain the vasospasm that characterizes the disease. Among the many factors influencing vascular reactivity and possibly implicated are: the renin-angiotensin system, prostaglandins, progesterone and its metabolites, calcium, magnesium, digoxin-like immunoreactive substance(s), auricular natriuretic factor, substances secreted by platelets and leukotrienes. Prevention of the disease is limited by the absence of a biological or clinical marker with good sensitivity and appropriate specificity. Many biochemical or hematological parameters have been reported: uric acid, calcium, magnesium, proteinuria, blood iron, hematocrit, platelet count, antithrombin III, estrogen and progesterone. The combination of several tests could be superior to the use of each test individually, providing a better sensitivity and improving the positive predictive value. With early detection, new therapies for the prevention of the disease could be experimented on the higher risk women before the apparition of clinical symptoms or signs. Furthermore, those tests could be used in the study of the pathophysiology and in the choice of the best therapy.",preeclampsia
Preeclampsia remains an important cause of avoidable maternal morbidity and mortality. Publication of guidelines and monitoring adherence to life-saving therapies should be prioritized. Prediction of fluid responsiveness requires individual hemodynamic investigation. Future studies are required to determine the optimal early warning system and monitoring tools for providing early and non-invasive hemodynamic assessment.,preeclampsia
"Placental ischemia is the background of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. It is mainly - but not exclusively - caused by an immunological conflict between maternal NK cells of the decidua and of the uterine junctional zone, and the HLA-C antigens shared by interstitial trophoblast. The maternal disease is the consequence of the placental ischemia, and is characterized by an inflammatory syndrome with an oxidative stress and an endothelial cell dysfunction. Genetics play an essential part in each of these steps.",preeclampsia
"Understanding the mechanisms of disease responsible for the syndrome of preeclampsia as well as early risk assessment is still a major challenge. The concentrations of circulating proteins in maternal blood such as placental growth factor, soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 and soluble endoglin are altered weeks before the onset of clinical symptoms of the syndrome. Recently, other proteins in maternal serum, such as activin A, inhibin A, PAPP-A, and PP13 have been suggested to be of value in first trimester risk assessment. Since preeclampsia is a syndrome, it seems unlikely that a single test will predict all forms of preeclampsia. This realization has led to the formulation of a new conceptual framework suggesting that a combination of markers (biochemical and/or biophysical) may be required to conduct comprehensive risk assessment for the syndrome.",preeclampsia
Preeclampsia is pregnancy-induced hypertension. The hypoxia at high altitude increases the incidence of preeclampsia. Endothelin is released in response to hypoxia and is associated with other hypertensive states at high altitude. Endothelin may play a major role in preeclampsia for individuals residing at high altitude. Endothelin antagonists may prove useful in the treatment of preeclampsia.,preeclampsia
"The current approach to screening for pre-eclampsia is based on guidelines that rely on medical and obstetric history in early pregnancy to select a high-risk group that might benefit from low-dose aspirin. However, combined screening tests with the addition of biophysical and biochemical measurements have shown significantly better detection rates for preterm pre-eclampsia. Furthermore, the administration of aspirin for the 10% screen-positive group can lead to a significant reduction in severe and preterm forms of pre-eclampsia. This review aims to answer frequently asked questions related to the clinical implementation of screening and the management of screening results.",preeclampsia
Hypertensive disorders are frequent during pregnancy and are related with an important morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this review we aim to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview of the clinical aspects of and the diagnostic tools used in the primary assessment and the (long term) follow-up of preeclampsia. The focus in this review will lay on the clinical follow-up of both the mother and the fetus aiming at the prevention of severe maternal complications as well as preventing growth restriction and prematurity in the child.,preeclampsia
"The cause of preeclampsia remains unknown. The disease manifests itself across a broad clinical spectrum from mild to severe, conferring vastly different morbidities and suggesting possibly different disease processes. Oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, maternal-fetal immune incompatibility, and abnormal placental implantation are among the suggested causes. The need for a marker or set of markers that allow for definitive diagnosis and assessment of future risk of preeclampsia is tremendous. Ultrasound techniques and several markers have been identified that are increased among patients with preeclampsia, but no test is highly sensitive. In the future, a combination of markers likely will be used to assess risk and, establish the diagnosis, and test treatment strategies. Such an approach would allow for more refined treatment studies of patients who are at highest risk for preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Severe preeclampsia can have a catastrophic effect on maternal-fetal outcome; therefore, perinatal nurses must have a working knowledge of related pathophysiologic processes to perform advanced assessment and interpret data. Technologic adjuncts developed over the past decade, such as the fiberoptic pulmonary artery catheter, allow more precise assessment of maternal hemodynamic status and oxygenation for some patients. With such information, the health-care team can guide therapy to promote optimal outcomes.",preeclampsia
"The benefit of the early administration of aspirin to reduce preterm pre-eclampsia among screened positive European women from multivariate algorithmic approach (ASPRE trial) has opened an intense debate on the feasibility of universal screening. This review aims to assess the new perspectives in the combined screening of pre-eclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy and the chances for prevention using low-dose aspirin with special emphasis on the particularities of the Asian population. PubMed, CENTRAL and Embase databases were searched from inception until 15 November 2017 using combinations of the search terms: preeclampsia, Asian, prenatal screening, early prediction, ultrasonography, pregnancy, biomarker, mean arterial pressure, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, placental growth factor, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A and pulsatility index. This is not a systematic review or meta-analysis, so the risk of bias of the selected published articles and heterogeneity among the studies need to be considered. The prevalence of pre-eclampsia and serum levels of biochemical markers in Asian are different from Caucasian women; hence, Asian ethnicity needs to be corrected for in the algorithmic assessment of multiple variables to improve the screening performance. Aspirin prophylaxis may still be viable in Asian women, but resource implication needs to be considered. Asian ethnicity should be taken into account before implementing pre-eclampsia screening strategies in the region. The variables included can be mixed and matched to achieve an optimal performance that is appropriate for economical restriction in individual countries.",preeclampsia
"Hundreds of reports deal with the subject of preeclampsia. A review of the world literature highlights the confusion and controversy regarding terminology, blood pressure measurements, diagnosis, and populations studied. More than 100 clinical, biophysical, and biochemical tests have been recommended to predict the future development of the disease. Results of the pooled data and the wide scatter therein suggest that none of these tests is sufficiently sensitive or specific for use as a screening test in clinical practice. There is some evidence that nutritional supplementation or antithrombotic agents might reduce the incidence of preeclampsia, but the data are not conclusive. In addition, the data do not suggest any benefit in perinatal outcome from the use of antihypertensive therapy in such pregnancies. The findings suggest that there is a definite need for standardization regarding definition, terminology, and diagnosis and for large multicenter clinical trials. Finally, there is an urgent need to identify a marker of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Severe preeclampsia is a major contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. This review was performed to assess the fetal and maternal benefits of allowing women presenting with severe preeclampsia between 24 and 32-34 weeks of amenorrhea to continue their pregnancy following antihypertensive treatment. After ultrasound scanning to assess growth and biophysical state of the fetus, patients without deteriorating maternal conditions, were managed with volume expansion, antihypertensive drugs (as hydralazine, labetalol, nifedipine), anticonvulsants and prophylactic steroids to promote fetal pulmonary maturity. Previous studies have indicated that this conservative management is also possible with the HELLP syndrome, without an increase in maternal morbidity.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia or toxaemia of pregnancy is a multi-organ disorder in the second half of pregnancy. Approximately 1-3% of all pregnancies in the Netherlands are complicated by this condition. The disease is characterised by vascular damage resulting in hypertension and proteinuria with high morbidity for both mother and child. The underlying cause is a poorly developed placenta. To date the only real treatment comprises medicinal protection against complications and the disorder can be cured only through termination of pregnancy. Complications range from severe hypertension to maternal mortality due to cerebral haemorrhage. Long-term consequences can be severe for both mother and child. For instance, the risk of cardiovascular disease in mothers in later life is significantly increased. Many risk factors have been identified, including diabetes, BMI and an age of above 40. The association between periodontal disease and pre-eclampsia emphasises the importance of good oral hygiene in the periconceptional period.",preeclampsia
"Background and purpose: Preeclampsia, a common disorder of unknown origin, presents with signs and symptoms that can be subtle, making assessment and intervention challenging. The purpose of this study was to refine the psychometric properties of an instrument designed to assess a comprehensive range of preeclampsia symptoms. Methods: Testing of the Preeclampsia Prenatal Symptom-Monitoring Scale (PPSMC) was accomplished through a retrospective, correlational, and comparative study of 100 postpartum women with preeclampsia and gestational hypertension. Results: The initial 17-item Cronbach's alpha was .73; reliability of the current 11-item PPSMC increased to .77. Content validity index for the PPSMC (17 items) was .88; for the PPSMC (11 items), .93. Exploratory factor analysis, known group comparisons, and predictive validity lend beginning support of the instrument's construct validity. Conclusion: This instrument may be useful in examining in greater detail the symptomatology of women with preeclampsia in practice and research settings.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in mothers, fetuses, and neonates worldwide, with 5%-10% of human births being affected. The cause is still uncertain, and many controversies exist concerning its management. Preeclampsia-eclampsia is due to the failure of extra-villous cytotrophoblast to invade the maternal uterine spiral arteries to a sufficient depth, inducing poor vascular exchanges between the mother and the placenta. This physiological endovascular trophoblast invasion represents a remarkable immunological placental-maternal interaction. Recent data strongly indicate an important role for the male partner in the causation of this common pregnancy disorder. This review aims to discuss the relevant literature and to explain how paternal, relational and sexual factors play an important role in the etiology of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia develops as a consequence of an exceptionally complex interaction between a multiplicity of factors that originate in 2 genetically different individuals (the mother and the fetus). Oxidative stress/oxidative lipid derivatives may represent one group of such factors. The evidence for a role of oxidative stress/oxidative lipid derivatives in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia may be summarized as follows: In women with established preeclampsia there is good evidence of increased oxidative stress/oxidative lipid derivatives in the decidual-placental tissues. Likewise, in the systemic circulation of women with established preeclampsia most of the studies although not all, indicate elevated levels of oxidative lipid derivatives and reduced anti-oxidative capacity. Because almost all studies on the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia have been among women with established preeclampsia, it remains uncertain whether enhanced oxidative stress is present before clinical signs of preeclampsia develops. One controlled randomized study in which antioxidants were used to treat severe preeclampsia showed nonsignificant differences in clinical outcomes in favor of antioxidants. Controlled studies on the effectiveness of antioxidants in preventing preeclampsia are lacking. Such studies are of major interest in order to evaluate more definitely the role of oxidative stress/oxidative lipid derivatives in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
Preeclampsia is a disease unique to pregnancy. Treatment for the disease has remained suboptimal because of the unknown etiology of the disease. Preventive strategies have been suggested and have provided new ways to approach the patient at risk for developing preeclampsia.,preeclampsia
"Platelet activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia as demonstrated by reduced platelet count, increased mean platelet volume and elevated plasma concentrations of beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 in pre-eclamptic patients. Thrombocytopenia precedes the onset of clinical symptoms of pre-eclampsia. Possibly an enhanced activation state of the platelets in the circulation is present some time before the onset of pre-eclampsia: platelet activation might then be used to predict pre-eclampsia. Flow cytometry is considered the most sensitive technique at this moment to measure the activation of platelets. Fluorescent-labelled antibodies are used to detect antigens that appear on the platelet surface or change their conformation upon activation. During the first and second trimester of pregnancy pre-eclamptic patients have an increased expression of some antigens on the surface of their platelets, such as CD63. There is no reliable platelet test yet to predict the onset of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"The cause of preeclampsia remains elusive in spite of many attempts to understand its biologic characteristics and to characterize its predictors. We suggest that there are distinct origins of preeclampsia, each with its own pathologic characteristics and natural history. One genesis is the result of reduced placental perfusion, which we will call placental, and another results from maternal disorders preexisting (but sometimes not evident before) pregnancy. These preexisting maternal disorders comprise predisposing factors for cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, renal disease, overweight, and diabetes. A critical review of the epidemiologic and pathologic literature is presented, which supports the hypothesis that preeclampsia is the result of heterogeneous causes. The implications of this hypothesis are discussed, particularly its impact on the development of rules to predict the occurrence of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"The early recognition of elevated blood pressure in pregnancy is still considered the most critical step in preventing the maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality associated with preeclampsia-eclampsia. The recognition of hypertension is enhanced by an initial assessment of a women's risk for developing high blood pressure during pregnancy, correct blood pressure measurement, and early prenatal care. The care of the woman with hypertension preceding a pregnancy or during a previous pregnancy includes not only early prenatal care but also pre- or interconceptual care that might minimize the risk of further blood pressure elevation during pregnancy, as well as later in life. Tests to predict preeclampsia, such as the ""roll"" test and the use of the mean arterial pressure during midpregnancy, have been found to be invalid because of poor predictive validity. Relative increases in blood pressure during pregnancy are also no longer considered diagnostic for preeclampsia, however, consideration of relative increases is still ""prudent"" in assessing signs and symptoms of this disease. The development of preeclampsia is thought to occur very early in pregnancy as a result of imbalances between vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory factors, probably accompanying implantation and placentation. The use of aspirin to prevent the development of hypertension and preeclampsia is currently being studied because it has been shown to shift the balance toward the metabolism of the vasodilatory prostaglandin, prostacycline. At this time, aspirin is only advised for women at high risk for developing preeclampsia. Calcium may also be a preventative mineral, and a diet that is adequate during pregnancy is advised.",preeclampsia
"Aims: To deduce the origin of preeclampsia characterized by hypertension and proteinuraia on the basis of results from animal studies and its therapeutic strategies. Methods: Sympathetic and parasympathetic zones of female non-pregnant rabbit brain were stimulated electrically with Kurotu's electrodes. Systolic blood pressure, urine volume, and proteinuria were evaluated before and after the stimulation of autonomic zones. Results: Excitation, hypertension, urine reduction, cloudy urine, and proteinuria were observed following stimulation of the sympathetic zone. A stable state, low blood pressure, increased urine volume, and no proteinuria were observed following stimulation of the parasympathetic zone. Conclusion: Hypertension and proteinuria in preeclampsia are caused by continuous stimulation of the sympathetic nervous center in the hypothalamus through the innervation between the enlarged uterus and hypothalamus in the latter stages of pregnancy or in a complete hydatidiform mole. Future studies are needed to address the potential of pharmacological suppression of an overactive sympathetic nerve system.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia has been called a disease of theories. One theory proposes a complex relationship between nutritional imbalance and the pathophysiology of this disease. The theoretical importance of selected nutrients is considered through reference to several recent basic research studies and clinical trials. With the clinical prevention of preeclampsia as a focus, suggestions for outpatient nutritional counseling, dietary alteration, and nutrient supplementation will be offered.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: To investigate the role of LPL-Ser447Ter and Asn291Ser polymorphisms in the predisposition to different types of preeclampsia, as well as the contribution to the lipid profile and the prognosis of preeclampsia. Methods: 125 women with preeclampsia and 131 normal pregnant women were genetically screened using PCR-restriction enzyme analysis. Results: We found an increased risk for mild and severe preeclampsia in carriers of the negative Ser447/Ser447 genotype. An increased risk for severe preeclampsia in carriers of the Asn291Ser polymorphism was seen. In mild and severe preeclampsia, carriers of the negative Ser447/Ser447 genotype had increased TG and LDL-C levels and decreased HDL-C levels as compared with carriers of the Ser447Ter polymorphism. The presence of the Asn291Ser polymorphism influenced the higher TG and LDL-C levels and the lower HDL-C levels in mild preeclampsia and the higher TG and LDL-C levels in severe preeclampsia. Women with severe preeclampsia, carriers of the Ser447/Ser447 genotype and women with mild preeclampsia, carriers of the Asn291Ser polymorphism, delivered at a lower gestational age neonates with a lower birth weight compared to women carriers of this polymorphism. Conclusions: The LPL variants are associated with severe preeclampsia and influence the lipid profile and pregnancy outcome in mild and severe preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Endothelial dysfunction is the final common pathway in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Future therapeutic modalities aimed at preventing or treating preeclampsia should either reduce the extent of (or even prevent) endothelial cell dysfunction (primary prevention) or should reduce the consequences of endothelial cell dysfunction (secondary and tertiary prevention). Relevant potential and promising directions for further research will be discussed. Part I of this review concerns the primary prevention of preeclampsia. The etiology of preeclampsia is still unknown. The 4 hypotheses that are the most popular currently are the placental ischemia hypothesis, the immune maladaptation/spiral artery-decidual ¿toxin' hypothesis, the VLDL (very low density lipoproteins)/TxPA (toxicity preventing activity) hypothesis, and the genetic hypothesis. For the near future only the disturbed VLDL/TxPA balance and the imbalance between free radicals and scavengers appear to be amenable for clinical research purposes.",preeclampsia
"Genuine preeclampsia is a disease of first pregnancies. The protective effect of multiparity, however, is lost with change of partner. Also, exposure to semen provides protection against developing preeclampsia. Analogous to altered paternity, artificial donor insemination and oocyte donation are reported to result in a substantial increase of preeclampsia. Thus, epidemiologic studies strongly suggest that immune maladaptation is involved in the etiology of preeclampsia. Although the exact etiology of preeclampsia remains unknown, the conclusions derived from epidemiologic studies may have consequences for practicing physicians: 1) according to the primipaternity concept, a multiparous women with a new partner should be approached as being a primigravid women; 2) artificial donor insemination and oocyte donation are associated with an increased risk of developing pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders; 3) a more or less prolonged period of sperm exposure provides a partial protection against pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders. In the 1990s, all women with changing partners are strongly advised to use condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. However, a certain period of sperm exposure within a stable relation, when pregnancy is aimed for, is associated with a partial protection against preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"This workshop had four main objectives: (A) Trying to look at the preeclampsia (PE) problem ""from the Space Shuttle"": why preeclampsia has emerged in humans (a specific human reproductive feature among 4300 mammal species)? (B) Epidemiology: there are major geographical differences concerning early onset PE and late onset PE throughout the world. (C) Vascular: The very promising use of pravastatin in the treatment of the vascular maternal syndrome (based on the metabolism of carbon monoxide (CO), the role of inositol phosphate glycans P-type (IPG-P), a major role in comprehending the insulin resistance phenotype in preeclampsia. (D) Immunology: the specialty of these workshops since their start in 1998; our understanding of the role of the immune system and the regulation of the deep implantation of the human trophoblast (and the obligatory compromises between the fetal/placental unit and the mother) have reached a kind of ""maturity,"" following the pivotal studies exploring the biology of repetitive sperm exposure in the female genital tract. The meeting of people who never meet each other in the course of their normal professional lives (obstetricians, evolutionists, geneticists, immunologists, fundamentalist vascular biologists, epidemiologists, anthropologists, neonatologists, etc.) permitted some fruitful reflections to be made again this year.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a complex pathophysiological state where regulatory systems of inflammation and endothelial function are stimulated beyond the physiological limits of normal pregnancy. Different lines of evidence indicate that abnormal lipid metabolism is not a mere manifestation but is also involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Lipid-mediated oxidative stress is likely to contribute to endothelial hyperstimulation leading to dysfunction and damage. Maternal predisposing factors seem to be essential to explain why some pregnant women develop a systemic syndrome such as preeclampsia and why others do not. Preliminary evidence suggests that abnormal lipid metabolism could be one of these factors. In this review the evidence for the contribution of lipid oxidation in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, the similarities between preeclampsia and lipid-mediated chronic vascular disease will be summarized, and the reasons to believe that constitutional lipid abnormalities could be one of the maternal predisposing factors for developing the disease will be examined and will be discussed.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia is associated with both maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is a protein interacting with angiogenesis, coagulation, and inflammatory responses, processes known to be altered in preeclamptic pregnancies. Significantly lower levels of HRG have been demonstrated as early as in the first trimester in women later developing preeclampsia compared with normal pregnancies. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the combination of HRG and uterine artery Doppler ultrasonography can be used as a predictor of preeclampsia. Methods: A total of 175 women were randomly selected from a case-control study; 86 women had an uncomplicated pregnancy and 89 women later developed preeclampsia. Blood samples and pulsatility index (PI) were obtained from both cases and controls in gestational week 14. Results: HRG levels were significantly lower in women who developed preterm preeclampsia compared with controls, but not for women developing preeclampsia in general. PI was significantly higher in the preeclampsia group compared with controls, especially in preterm preeclampsia. The combination of HRG and PI revealed a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 62% for preterm preeclampsia. Conclusions: The combination of HRG and uterine artery Doppler may predict preterm preeclampsia in early pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"In a population-based sample, the authors examined the validity of preeclampsia and related diagnoses recorded in a mandatory Danish national hospital discharge registry and in a standardized telephone interview of women who gave birth between 1998 and 2002. Using a ""gold standard"" for preeclampsia defined in accordance with the guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the authors reviewed hospital charts of 3,039 women and found that 61 of 88 preeclampsia cases (69.3%) and 24 of 55 cases of serious subtypes of preeclampsia (43.6%) were recorded as such by the registry. A total of 21 of 2,951 women without preeclampsia (0.71%) had a preeclampsia diagnosis in the registry. All registrations of serious subtypes of preeclampsia reflected true cases. The positive predictive value of a preeclampsia diagnosis in the registry was 74.4%. Including interview data reduced the sample size to 2,307 women. In this sample, of 62 women with preeclampsia, 45 (72.6%) reported in the interview to have had preeclampsia. Of 2,245 women with no preeclampsia, 31 (1.4%) reported to have had preeclampsia. The positive predictive value of the women's own report on preeclampsia was 59.2%. The authors conclude, for the purpose of etiologic studies, that the registry had acceptable validity, whereas the usefulness of self-reported information may be limited.",preeclampsia
"Point shear wave elastography is an ultrasonography technique used to evaluate tissue elasticity. We examined whether placental elasticity is useful for predicting the onset of pre-eclampsia. Two hundred twenty-one participants were divided into two groups: one group at low risk (n = 185) and the other at high risk (n = 36) for pre-eclampsia. The two groups were compared with respect to shear wave velocity (SWV) of the placenta. Use of SWV as a predictor of pre-eclampsia was also investigated by creating a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve was used to set a cutoff SWV value for predicting pre-eclampsia. The SWV of the high-risk group was significantly higher than that of the low-risk group (p < 0.001). Thirteen participants developed pre-eclampsia after SWV measurements, and the SWVs of these participants were significantly higher than those of participants in who pre-eclampsia did not develop. The cutoff value and area under the ROC curve were 1.188 m/s and 0.9118, respectively. Placental elasticity was significantly increased even before the onset of pre-eclampsia onset and, thus, may be a parameter used to predict the onset of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"We hypothesize that regular exercise enhances antioxidative enzymes in pregnant women, which reduce oxidative stress and, thus, the incidence of preeclampsia. Oxidative stress with enhanced lipid peroxide formation could lead to endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia. Other conditions, such as increased transferrin saturation and decreased iron-binding capacity, directly and indirectly promote the process of oxidative stress and subsequent endothelial dysfunction. Exercise increases oxidative metabolism and produces a prooxidant environment. This acidic environment during exercise (at or beyond anaerobic threshold) promotes oxygen release from hemoglobin and increases in PO(2) in tissues, as well as releases iron from transferrin. When exercise is repeated regularly, the body promptly adjusts so that oxidative stress is eliminated or reduced. The body's adaptations to a regular exercise habit seem to have an antioxidant effect. In humans, training effects have been identified with an enhanced activity of antioxidative enzymes. Another concerted adaptation that regular exercise brings to women's bodies is resistance against production of prooxidants by increasing the number of mitochondria. Equally important is a training effect that decreases susceptibility to lipid peroxidation. Evidence suggests that physically active women are less likely to develop preeclampsia. In theory, intracellular and extracellular conditions resulting from regular exercise should counteract the enhancement of oxidative stress, thus interfering with the process leading to endothelial dysfunction. This position paper describes a hypothesis and includes a brief review of exercise physiology and biochemical research in preeclampsia. Unlike other preventive treatments, such as aspirin or calcium supplements, a regular exercise habit leads to a positive and healthy lifestyle without concern of side effects.",preeclampsia
"An antiangiogenic state might constitute a terminal pathway for the multiple aetiologies of pre-eclampsia, especially those resulting from placental abnormalities. The levels of angiogenic and antiangiogenic proteins in maternal blood change prior to a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, correlate with disease severity and have prognostic value in identifying women who will develop maternal and/or perinatal complications. Potential interventions exist to ameliorate the imbalance of angiogenesis and, hence, might provide opportunities to improve maternal and/or perinatal outcomes in pre-eclampsia. Current strategies for managing pre-eclampsia consist of controlling hypertension, preventing seizures and timely delivery of the fetus. Prediction of pre-eclampsia in the first trimester is of great interest, as early administration of aspirin might reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, albeit modestly. Combinations of biomarkers typically predict pre-eclampsia better than single biomarkers; however, the encouraging initial results of biomarker studies require external validation in other populations before they can be used to facilitate intervention in patients identified as at increased risk. Angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors might also be useful in triage of symptomatic patients with suspected pre-eclampsia, differentiating pre-eclampsia from exacerbations of pre-existing medical conditions and performing risk assessment in asymptomatic women. This Review article discusses the performance of predictive and prognostic biomarkers for pre-eclampsia, current strategies for preventing and managing the condition and its long-term consequences.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To present a review of literature and to present our experiences of patients with preeclampsia. Design: Review article. Setting: Second Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Medical Faculty of the Safarik University and L. Pasteur's Hospital, Kosice, Slovak Republic. Methods: Compilation of data from scientific literature. Results and conclusion: The etiology of preeclampsia is still unknown. The 4 hypotheses currently accepted are the placental ischemia hypothesis, genetic hypothesis, the immune maladaption and hypothesis of the imbalance between free oxygen radicals and scavengers in favor of oxidants. At the present is most popular the theory of oxidative stress, that lead to increased production of lipide peroxides, tromboxane A2 and decreased level of prostacyclin. This imbalance triggers endothelial dysfunction and its clinical manifestation. Scavenging antioxidants have protective effect in this process.",preeclampsia
"Nurses are increasingly encountering pregnant/postpartum women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, of which preeclampsia is one of the most common. The Joint Commission published a Sentinel Event Alert in 2010 on prevention of maternal death. This report notes that one of the 5 leading causes of pregnancy-related mortality between 1991 and 1997 was ""hypertensive disorder."" Preeclampsia presents significant risk to the health of the mother and the fetus. Clearly, nurses must understand the pathophysiology, assessment, management, recurrence risk, and long-term implications of preeclampsia to participate fully in a management plan that promotes safe patient care.",preeclampsia
"The objective of this review was to provide a comprehensive and practical concept on the pathogenesis of preeclampsia on the basis of the currently available scientific evidence. A MEDLINE search was performed of English-language articles published between 1966 and 1997, supplemented with references cited in relevant research articles. Using our data sources, we developed a scheme describing the sequence of events between implantation and the time of manifest clinical disease characterized by generalized endothelial cell dysfunction. A yet unidentified toxic circulating factor released by the ischemic placenta, is held responsible for the impaired endothelial cell function. Particularly, epidemiological studies point to a concept in which immune maladaptation to the fetal allograft plays a key role in causing defective placentation leading to placental ischaemia. The incidence of preeclampsia in sisters and daughters of women who had had preeclampsia is raised. Disease states with vascular involvement, like chronic hypertension and diabetes mellites, are associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia. Recently subclinical abnormalities in hemostasis, metabolism and volume homeostasis have been described in patients with a history of preeclampsia. Placental ischemia secondary to defective placentation, a prerequisite for the development of preeclampsia, has a multifactorial origin consisting of three major components: immune maladaptation, genetic predisposition, and vascular mediated factors. Probably, a summation of these factors will determine whether a pregnant woman is to develop the syndrome. The recently described subclinical abnormalities in hemostasis, metabolism, and vascular function in patients with a history of preeclampsia might give the clinician the opportunity to reduce the recurrence risk by pharmacotherapeutic intervention.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a hypertensive, multisystem disorder of pregnancy whose etiology remains unknown. Although management is evidence-based, preventative measures/screening tools are lacking, treatment remains symptomatic, and delivery remains the only cure. Past hypotheses/scientific contributions have influenced current understanding of preeclampsia pathophysiology and guided management strategies and classification criteria. To provide insight into how past hypotheses/scientific contributions have shaped current practice trends, this article provides a historical overview of preeclampsia-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. It remains a management challenge despite recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition and its prevention, and it remains a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The hallmarks of preeclampsia are proteinuria and edema in a woman who is hypertensive. Current theories suggest altered prostaglandin synthesis, inappropriate sensitivity to angiotensin II and immunologic factors as etiologies of preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin therapy and high-dose calcium supplementation show promise in preventing preeclampsia and reducing its severity when it occurs. However, aggressive antenatal maternal and fetal assessment, magnesium sulfate therapy and early delivery are the standards of preeclampsia management.",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy complication affecting both mother and fetus. Although there is no proven effective method to prevent pre-eclampsia, early identification of women at risk of pre-eclampsia could enhance appropriate application of antenatal care, management and treatment. Very little is known about the cost effectiveness of these and other tests for pre-eclampsia, mainly because there is no clear treatment path. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing evidence on the health economics of screening, diagnosis and treatment options in pre-eclampsia. Methods: We searched three electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library) for studies on screening, diagnosis, treatment or prevention of pre-eclampsia, published between 1994 and 2014. Only full papers written in English containing complete economic assessments in pre-eclampsia were included. Results: From an initial total of 138 references, six papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Three studies were on the cost effectiveness of treatment of pre-eclampsia, two of which evaluated magnesium sulphate for prevention of seizures and the third evaluated the cost effectiveness of induction of labour versus expectant monitoring. The other three studies were aimed at screening and diagnosis, in combination with subsequent preventive measures. The two studies on magnesium sulphate were equivocal on the cost effectiveness in non-severe cases, and the other study suggested that induction of labour in term pre-eclampsia was more cost effective than expectant monitoring. The screening studies were quite diverse in their objectives as well as in their conclusions. One study concluded that screening is probably not worthwhile, while two other studies stated that in certain scenarios it may be cost effective to screen all pregnant women and prophylactically treat those who are found to be at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Discussion: This study is the first to provide a comprehensive overview on the economic aspects of pre-eclampsia in its broadest sense, ranging from screening to treatment options. The main limitation of the present study lies in the variety of topics in combination with the limited number of papers that could be included; this restricted the comparisons that could be made. In conclusion, novel biomarkers in screening for and diagnosing pre-eclampsia show promise, but their accuracy is a major driver of cost effectiveness, as is prevalence. Universal screening for pre-eclampsia, using a biomarker, will be feasible only when accuracy is significantly increased.",preeclampsia
"This review summarizes the literature to date on the subject of the chronobiology of blood pressure in pregnancy, and more specifically, in the common disease state of high blood pressure in pregnancy or preeclampsia. While the guidelines for treating hypertension in pregnancy use absolute measures to start treatment, they do not take into account the important rhythms of hypertension including nighttime and daytime readings. These variations are likely to have strong impacts on pregnancy outcomes, risk and long-term hypertension risk.",preeclampsia
"There is little published data on the incidence of remote hypertension, microalbuminuria (a possible marker of remote cardiovascular events) and diabetes following preeclampsia. This is of particular importance in Pacific Island populations as they have a high rate of preeclampsia, non-insulin dependent diabetes and cardiovascular related deaths. The aim of this study was to compare the rate of microalbuminuria and hypertension in 50 Samoan women with past preeclampsia (cases) with 50 Samoan women who did not have past preeclampsia (controls). Forty per cent of cases were hypertensive at follow-up compared to 2% in the control group (p < 0.0001). Microalbuminuria or proteinuria occurred in 40% of women with past preeclampsia and 18% of controls (p < 0.02). Half of the cases with microalbuminuria were hypertensive. No case or control had an elevated fructosamine, suggesting that current diabetes was an unlikely explanation for the microalbuminuria. We conclude that Samoan women with past preeclampsia are at increased risk of developing chronic hypertension and microalbuminuria. The significance of the microalbuminuria after preeclampsia is not known, but it may be a marker of either remote cardiovascular morbidity or non-insulin dependent diabetes. This study raises longterm health implications for women with preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Contemporary scientific data show that there is a link between insulin resistance and preeclampsia. Many features of the insulin resistance syndrome are common with this condition. These include hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, obesity and lipid abnormalities. The women with preeclampsia are more insulin resistant than those with normal pregnancy. The surrogate markers of insulin resistance like leptin, TNF-alpha, tissue plasminogen activator, SHBG etc are also changed in preeclampsia. Whether these changes are connected with etiology or with the pathogenesis of preeclampsia is still not clear.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia (PE) is one of the most severe complications of pregnancy. PE is responsible for the highest rates of morbidity and mortality for both pregnant women and the neonate. In this review, we first address general aspects of PE and its diagnosis, along with some epidemiological aspects of this disease in the mexican population, in particular the experience from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social. Even though over the last 20 years a great deal of evidence has accumulated regarding PE's pathophysiology, an exact mechanism to explain its etiology has not been established. This review aims to cover the status of two of the most important hypotheses in the etiology of PE: the immunological and the placental ischemia hypotheses. Recent data suggest that Natural Killer cells (NK) play a major role in the decidual spiral arteriole remodeling and in normal placental development. In genetic studies, KIR receptors present in NK cells have been involved in the susceptibility for the disease. In this review, we discuss data of our group regarding the presence of NK cells in the decidua, at the end of pregnancy and the genotypes of KIR receptors in normal and preeclamptic Mexican population. PE is characterized by abnormal placentation and hypoxia with an increase of anti-angiogenic factors; the Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alfa (HIF1-alfa) is over expressed in PE. In this review, we also included some of our results concerning the polymorphisms and regulation of HIF in preeclamptic women.",preeclampsia
"Many markers have been proposed to identify the pregnant woman at risk to develop preeclampsia, without finding at the moment the gold standard. Objective: The main purpose of the present study was to know if the detection of microalbuminuria in early stages of pregnancy is a good predictor of preeclampsia. Methods and material: One hundred and two women (102) were studied. All of them had risk factors for preeclampsia with a pregnancy between 16 and 18 weeks, an evaluation of microalbuminuria was done through a clean-catch dipstick of the first miction of the day, excluding patients with urinary tract infections and nephropaty, > 20 mg/L was considered a positive value. Diagnosis data of preeclampsia were recopilated from the clinical chart of each patient after the pregnancy was resolved. Results: Of the 102 patients, 53 had a negative microalbuminuria, 6 (11%) developed preeclampsia and 47 (88%) did not. Forty nine women had positive microalbuminuria and 23 (46.9%) of them developed preeclampsia and 26 (53%) did not. The sensitivity was 79%, specificity 63%, the positive predictive value was 46% and the negative predictive value was 88%. Conclusions: The detection of microalbuminuria in early stages of pregnancy could be a good predictor of preeclampsia, moreover it is a simple and feasible procedure to do by the obstetrician.",preeclampsia
"Although the precise pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia remains unknown, this condition continues to be a major cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. Early prediction of pre-eclampsia would allow for timely initiation of preventive therapy A combination of biophysical and biochemical markers are superior to other tests for early prediction of the development of pre-eclampsia. This article reviews the current research of the most important strategies for prediction of pre-eclampsia, including the use of maternal risk factors, mean maternal arterial pressure, ultrasound parameters, and biomarkers.",preeclampsia
"Lipid accumulation - in hepatoytes (both subclinically and in acute fatty liver of pregnancy), in the endothelium of placental vessels (""acute atherosis""), and in the bloodstream - has been well established to be a consequence of preeclampsia. Hyperlipidemia (specifically hypertriglyceridemia) has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for the development of preeclampsia. These lipid-related aspects of preeclampsia may appear unrelated, but all are here demonstrated to provide evidence for a causative role for endothelin in the etiology of preeclampsia. Evidence for the potential of endothelin to cause lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and in endothelial cells, by means of activating G protein cascades in these cells, is presented. The capacity of typical free fatty acid constituents of triglycerides to ""drive"" interacellular G protein cascade-related events is also discussed - which, in this scheme, offers a plausible explanation for hypertriglyceridemia's role as a risk factor for developing preeclampsia. Additional evidence is provided which substantiates endothelin's capacity to cause most of the observed aberrations known to occur in preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Purpose: Increased inflammatory response and cytokines are claimed to play a significant role in the etiology of preeclampsia. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine. Limited number of studies evaluating IL-6 levels in preeclamptic patients have produced conflicting results. Therefore, the present study sought to compare maternal and umbilical cord serum levels of IL-6 in early- and late-onset preeclamptic pregnancies as well as in normal pregnancies. Materials and methods: A total of 69 participants were enrolled in the study. The control group consisted of 24 participants with normal pregnancies. Preeclampsia group consisted of 45 participants. The preeclampsia group was further classified into the subgroups of early- and late-onset preeclampsia. Late-onset preeclampsia group consisted of 24 women whereas early-onset preeclampsia group consisted of 21 women. Serum and umbilical cord samples of IL-6 were compared. Results: There was no significant difference between maternal and umbilical cord serum IL-6 concentrations between the preeclampsia and control group. No significant difference was observed in maternal and umbilical cord serum IL-6 levels between early- and late-onset preeclampsia groups. Conclusion: Our results do not support an increase in IL-6 levels in patients with early- and late-onset preeclampsia. The clinical relevance of our findings needs to be further investigated.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a life-threatening perinatal complication with unknown etiology. Microarray technology has characterized global gene expression in complex disorders such as preeclampsia. Nursing research and future practice may incorporate findings from microarray analyses to identify susceptibility to and prevent disease, to diagnose early, and to design and monitor personalized therapies. This overview of microarray technology, with emphasis on how it can inform genomics of preeclampsia, may provide concepts to improve future maternal-neonatal nursing care.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a syndrome characterized by hypertension, proteinuria and edema in a pregnant female after 20 weeks of gestation, including occurring in the postpartum period. Delivery of the infant is usually considered the definitive treatment for preeclampsia. Preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy. However, it is unusual for preeclampsia to resolve with delivery of the infant and then recur in the same pregnancy in the postpartum period. We present here a case report of a woman who had antepartum preeclampsia treated with delivery. She then had a recurrence of the classic signs of preeclampsia in the postpartum period. Ultimately she was admitted and treated with magnesium with a final diagnosis of recurrent preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"The successful anesthetic management of women with preeclampsia requires familiarity with the pathophysiology and hemodynamic changes characteristic of the disease process. Currently, overwhelming laboratory and clinical evidence attests to the safety and benefits of continuous lumbar epidural anesthesia in women with preeclampsia. For women with the milder form of the disease process, routine anesthetic care is sufficient. In those with severe preeclampsia, blood pressure should be controlled and intravascular volume status optimized with the aid of invasive monitoring. It is important to remember that decreased plasma proteins and presence of hepatic and renal dysfunction can influence maternal responses to drug therapy. The use of short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as esmolol, and calcium entry-blocking agents, such as nifedipine, for blood pressure control before anesthetic induction and the role of epidural morphine and clonidine for postcesarean section pain relief are currently under investigation.",preeclampsia
"The purpose of this article is to review recent epidemiologic and pathophysiologic findings that advance the understanding of preeclampsia for the nurse in perinatal practice. Preeclampsia is different from other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Risk factors for preeclampsia and recent findings regarding normal and aberrant implantation are presented. Abnormal implantation and resulting poor placental perfusion may be the impetus for endothelial changes evidenced in preeclampsia; pathophysiology is described in relation to this event. The interaction of maternal factors, reduced placental perfusion, and endothelial cell dysfunction provides an explanation for the occurrence of preeclampsia and provides a basis for nursing practice and research. Implications for nursing care for women of childbearing age before, during, or after pregnancy may include (a) preconception or post-delivery counseling to reduce modifiable risk factors such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle, or high fat intake, (b) assessment of risk factors and increased surveillance when risk factors are present, and (c) surveillance of blood pressure changes of > 30 mmHg systolic or > 15 mmHg diastolic in advance of the third trimester of pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"The signs and symptoms of preeclampsia become apparent at a relatively late stage in pregnancy (third trimester). However, the disorder results from abnormal interaction between fetal and maternal tissue much earlier in pregnancy (first trimester). For this reason, numerous methods have been proposed for the early detection of preeclampsia with considerable disagreement regarding their sensitivity and predictive values. Various reports suggest that preeclampsia is caused by an abnormal maternal immune response to antigenic challenge by the fetoplacental allograft. Moreover, since cytokines are involved in the control of immune response and also have a role in fetal development, their release from the placenta as a consequence of the abnormal maternal immune response, may precede the consequential cascade of pathophysiological reactions shown in preeclampsia. These assumptions may suggest that plasma cytokines' measurements may be used for the early detection of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Although pre-eclampsia affects 5-10% of pregnancies globally and is responsible for substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, currently there is no cure other than delivery of the baby. Predictive screening tests based on clinical risk factors, with or without the addition of biomarkers and imaging, have been developed, but adoption into clinical practice is limited by suboptimal test performance. Once established pre-eclampsia is diagnosed, a woman is usually managed expectantly prior to 37weeks' gestation to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality associated with iatrogenic prematurity until maternal or fetal triggers for delivery mean that risks of pregnancy prolongation outweigh the benefits. Associated fetal growth restriction is a common feature of pre-eclampsia, particularly with early-onset disease, and will influence decisions for delivery and subsequent neonatal course. Prematurity and fetal growth restriction both have potential short and long-term consequences for the infant and child.",preeclampsia
"We investigated coagulation/fibrinolysis parameters for significant differences between patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia (< 32 weeks gestation, wG) and those with late-onset severe preeclampsia (> or = 32 wG). A decrease in antithrombin (AT), protein C (PC), and free protein S (PS) activities and an increase in plasmin-alpha2-plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC), thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), and FDP D-dimer (D-dimer) were observed. However, there were no statistical differences between the two groups. Once preeclampsia occurred and it developed severe, the changes in coagulation/fibrinolysis parameters became more severe in spite of early-onset preeclampsia or late-onset preeclampsia. We also investigated coagulation/fibrinolysis abnormalities in 101 patients with severe preeclampsia. A significant increase in WBC, RBC, Hb, Ht, TAT, PIC, and D-dimer and a significant decrease in platelet (Plt) counts and AT activity were observed. deltaPlt (the difference between platelet counts in early gestation and before delivery) was -5.0 x 10(4)/microL in cases with severe preeclampsia. Among patients with severe preeclampsia, coagulation/fibrinolysis changes before delivery were typical for patients with cesarean section compared with those with successful vaginal delivery. These facts suggest that an excessive hypercoagulable state is associated with the termination of pregnancy resulting from the aggravation of preeclampsia. From the viewpoint of coagulation/fibrinolysis changes, the termination of pregnancy could be recommended when the levels of parameters exceed the following values; deltaPlt > -6.0 x 10(4) microL, D-dimer > 4 microg/mL, AT activity < 79%, TAT > 26 ng/mL, and PIC > 1.2 microg/mL. Particularly, deltaPlt and D-dimer are useful bedside predictive markers in order to decide the optimal time for the termination of pregnancy in patients with severe preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Introduction: Pre-eclampsia is a hypertensive gestational disorder that affects approximately 5% of all pregnancies. Objectives: As the pathophysiological processes of pre-eclampsia are still uncertain, the present case-control study explored underlying metabolic processes characterising this disease. Methods: Maternal peripheral plasma samples were collected from pre-eclamptic (n = 32) and healthy pregnant women (n = 35) in the third trimester. After extraction, high-resolution mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics was used to profile polar and apolar metabolites and the resulting data were analysed via uni- and multivariate statistical approaches. Results: The study demonstrated that the metabolome undergoes substantial changes in pre-eclamptic women. Amongst the most discriminative metabolites were hydroxyhexacosanoic acid, diacylglycerols, glycerophosphoinositols, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide metabolites, bile acids and products of amino acid metabolism. Conclusions: The putatively identified compounds provide sources for novel hypotheses to help understanding of the underlying biochemical pathology of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia remains the second leading direct cause of maternal death, >99 % of which occurs in less developed countries. Over 90 percent of the observed reduction in pre-eclampsia-related maternal deaths in the UK (1952-2008) occurred with antenatal surveillance and timed delivery. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, disease prediction models, prevention and management of pre-eclampsia. The Pre-eclampsia Integrated Estimate of RiSk (PIERS) models and markers of angiogenic imbalance identify women at incremental risk for severe pre-eclampsia complications. For women at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia, low doses of aspirin (especially if started <17 weeks) and calcium are evidence-based preventative strategies; heparin is less so. Severe hypertension must be treated and the Control of Hypertension In Pregnancy (CHIPS) Trial (reporting: 2014) will guide non-severe hypertension management. Magnesium sulfate prevents and treats eclampsia; there is insufficient evidence to support alternative regimens. Pre-eclampsia predicts later cardiovascular disease; however, at this time we do not know what to do about it.",preeclampsia
Background: The aim of our study was to evaluate the number of women with hypertensive complications during pregnancy in a southern province in Zimbabwe and to examine the annual change in the incidence of preeclampsia. Methods: In three different hospitals the preeclamptic women who were treated between January 1992 and August 1995 were counted. This data was compared with the amount of rainfall obtained from the local meteorological stations. Results: A distinctive change in the incidence of preeclampsia during the year could be observed. These changes go along with the seasonal variation in precipitation: at the end of the dry season and in the first months of the rainy season there is an increase in the incidence. Conclusions: The relationship between climate and occurrence of preeclampsia raises new questions in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Possible explanations could be the impact of humidity and temperature on vessels or the production of vasoactive substances. Dry and rainy seasons influence the agricultural yields and therefore the nutritional status could also play a role in the pathophysiology.,preeclampsia
"Objective: To identify symptoms that prompted a group of women readmitted for postpartum severe preeclampsia or eclampsia to seek medical care. Design: Retrospective, case-control. Setting: Tertiary-care teaching hospital. Subjects: The study group consisted of 53 women readmitted in the postpartum period with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia. The control group was matched two-to-one with an index study participant and consisted of 106 women who had intrapartum severe preeclampsia or eclampsia. Main outcome measures: Patient symptoms, physical findings, laboratory assays. Results: Neurologic complaints, malaise, and nausea and vomiting were reported more often in women who were readmitted than in mothers with intrapartum preeclampsia (all p values less than .001). Headaches were positively correlated with systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure in women who were readmitted (all p values less than .05), although there was no relationship between blood pressure and headaches in the control group. In addition, multivariate analysis revealed that study participants were more likely to deliver at full term, have headaches and malaise, have normal platelet values, and develop seizures than mothers in the control group, chi 2 = 155.7, p < .001. Conclusions: Women readmitted for postpartum severe preeclampsia or eclampsia have a clinical presentation that differs from that of intrapartum preeclampsia or eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Background: Hypertensive complications contribute to maternal and fetal morbidity. Hypertensive diseases in pregnancy comprise various disorder from transient hypertension to the dangerous preeclampsia/eclampsia. Diagnosis of these diseases requires an understanding of the normal physiological adaptations during pregnancy. Pathogenesis: The primary cause of preeclampsia/eclampsia is a disturbed growth of throphoblast cells, probably induced by an altered maternal immunotolerance. The consequence is a dysfunction of endothelial cells with a decrease in perfusion of the uterus and placenta. The normal balance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators is changed in favor of vasoconstrictors. Complex changes in the renin-angiotensin system have been detected resulting in an increased angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction. The reduction in perfusion of the uterus and placenta eventually leads to preeclampsia/eclampsia and growth retardation of the fetus. Manifest preeclampsia/eclampsia is characterized by disturbed microcirculation of target organs such as brain, liver and kidney. An involvement of the liver causes the HELLP syndrome. Therapy: Various pharmacological approaches to prevent preeclampsia/eclampsia showed disappointing results, but patients with a risk for the eventual development of preeclampsia/eclampsia should be identified, closely monitored, and hypertension should be treated. A systolic blood pressure > 170 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure > 100 mm Hg should be treated. Drugs such as alpha-methyldopa and dihydralazine that are well-characterized in their fetal effects are the primary choice for the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy. ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists are absolutely, diuretics are relatively contraindicated. The causal therapy for preeclampsia/eclampsia is delivery. Gravida before the 33th week of pregnancy should be admitted, hypertension should be treated, and the fetus should be monitored by duplex ultrasound and cardiotocography. New data suggest that early treatment with glucocorticoids may prevent the manifestation of HELLP syndrome. Hypertensive pregnant patients should be treated in tertiary centers with an interdisciplinary approach involving obstetricians, neonatologists, and nephrologists.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia which affects approximatively 2% of pregnancies is a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia is nowadays increasingly understood. It implies multiple actors and biomarkers appear to be playing a major role. New uses of those biomarkers for risk stratification and diagnosis of predisposed preeclamptic patients followed by obstetricians is an hot topic. The combined approach of biomarkers, medical history and obstetrical ultrasounds enables risk estimation in the first quarter and later on. A better understanding of this risk would enable better monitoring of obstetrical patients and reduce the occurrence of adverse complications for them and for the fetal well-being.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Preeclampsia occurs in some twin gestations in association with a placental disorder of one but not both fetuses, thereby placing both at risk. We investigated a novel method of treating preeclampsia in these pregnancies. Study design: Three patients with second trimester preeclampsia linked to a lethal condition in one twin were treated with selective fetocide in an effort to reverse preeclampsia. Two patients presented with twins discordant for severe fetal growth restriction, and 1 patient presented with Ballantyne syndrome and twins discordant for fetal hydrops. Results: Preeclampsia resolved in all 3 patients, allowing continuation of the pregnancy for an additional 9 to 23 weeks before delivery of the remaining fetus. Resolution of preeclampsia occurred in a timeframe consistent with placental involution documented in similar clinical circumstances. Conclusion: Selective fetocide may be an option for treating preeclampsia in some twin pregnancies, presumably by causing involution of the pathologic placenta. Delivery is not the only cure for preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"In the western world, pre-eclampsia, diagnosed in 3-5% of pregnant women, is a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Once pre-eclampsia is diagnosed, the only effective treatment is delivery. There are known historical risk factors for the development of pre-eclampsia, however only 30% of the women who will develop pre-eclampsia are identified based on their presence. Recently, new first trimester algorithms for the prediction of pre-eclampsia were developed, based on the observation that pregnant women who develop pre-eclampsia have imbalanced placental angiogenic factors and that failure of the trophoblastic migration may change the flow in the uterine arteries. These algorithms include maternal history and demographics, biochemical and clinical markers (mean arterial pressure, uterine artery flow PLGF, PAPP-A, PP-13). The combination of early diagnosis of a high risk group together with promising evidence that simple preventive measures, such as low-dose aspirin and calcium supplements may prevent pre-eclampsia or change its appearance leads to the idea that we are on the verge of a new era regarding detection and prevention of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"From the clinical point of view proteinuric hypertension or preeclampsia is the most important form of hypertension in pregnancy and carries the greatest risks for mother and foetus. The syndrome 'preeclampsia' differs from other types of hypertension and its effects on mother and foetus are not clearly benefited by lowering the blood pressure with drugs. The characteristic morphological changes and altered vascular reactivity which develop in preeclampsia commence at about 14 weeks gestation, long before hypertension or proteinuria appear. Many abnormalities in coagulation mechanisms appear in preeclampsia and some may play an important part in pathogenesis. Increased plasminogen activator inhibitor may play a key role. Antihypertensive drugs used during pregnancy may reduce foetal mortality and the incidence of preeclampsia. Calcium supplementation and aspirin may reduce the incidence of preeclampsia in high risk subjects. Heparin and dipyridamole may reduce the risk of preeclampsia in high risk patients with renal disease.",preeclampsia
"Once classified as a seizure disorder and later as a hypertensive condition, preeclampsia is actually a multisystem disease. It remains a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity. Clinical challenges include identifying patients who are at risk of serious complications and deciding whether it is safer for the fetus to be delivered or to remain in the uterus.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria with or without oedema. Material and methods: The authors highlight some aspects of preeclampsia: epidemiology, classification, clinical evaluation and treatment. Results: The condition may be classified as light or severe. Preeclampsia can induce damage to the placenta, liver, kidneys and brain, in addition to complications like the HELLP syndrome, placental abruption and eclampsia. Thrombocyte activation may cause activation of the coagulation system and thrombocytopenia. Early onset preeclampsia (< 34 weeks) is often associated with placental infarcts and reduced fetal growth. Interpretation: We focus on early signs and close clinical surveillance. The diastolic blood pressure should be estimated with Korotkoffs' phase V. Patients with early onset preeclampsia should be hospitalized, as should women with hypertension and newly developed proteinuria. Antihypertensive treatment is discussed. Cases with reduced fetal growth and those with severe preeclampsia should in most cases be delivered preterm. Vaginal delivery is preferable. Labour may be induced by oxtocin, following cervical prostaglandin stimulation as indicated. In such cases cardiotocography surveillance during labour should be performed. Caesarean section may be performed in selected cases. Patients with mild preeclampsia can await spontaneous vaginal delivery at term, but delivery should be induced if they proceed past term.",preeclampsia
"Background: To describe maternal characteristics and blood pressure behavior in the puerperium of women admitted, during pregnancy, with diagnosis of severe preeclampsia. Methods: A cohort study was conducted including pregnant women with gestational age of 28 weeks or more, with diagnosis of preeclampsia, not in labor, at the Instituto Materno Infantil Professor Fernando Figueira (IMIP) from November 2006 to September 2007. Patients with chronic hypertension, autoimmune diseases, gestational diabetes, multiple pregnancy and signs of clinical instability were excluded. Biological, demographic and obstetrical characteristics were analyzed, as well as the behavior of systolic and diastolic blood pressure post partum. Results: 154 patients with severe preeclampsia were included. The mean maternal age was 25.1 + 6.5 years. Regarding education only 45.5% had completed 11 years of schooling. Only 20.1% of deliveries were vaginal and preterm newborns occurred in 59.8% of cases. Two cases of eclampsia, eighteen cases of HELLP syndrome and 43 cases of oliguria were registered. Length of post partum hospital stay varied from one to 30 days, and 45% of patients were in hospital until the seventh day after delivery. Hypertensive emergencies were registered in 53.9% of the patients during puerperium and use of antihypertensive drugs was maintained in 76.5% of the women. Conclusions: Preeclamptic women tend to have controlled blood pressures after the third day of puerperium and are likely to be discharged from hospital still using anti-hypertensive drugs. Key-words: Severe preeclampsia, post partum period complications.",preeclampsia
"We performed a prospective, controlled, masked study designed to evaluate the ocular manifestations of preeclampsia in 56 patients, including 25 control, 17 mild preeclamptic, and 14 severe preeclamptic patients. There was a statistically significant correlation between the reduction in arteriole to vein ratio and a diagnosis of severe preeclampsia (r = -.32, P = .004). There was also a significant correlation between the number of focal constrictions and a diagnosis of severe preeclampsia (r = .34, P = .005). The arteriole to vein ratio and number of focal constrictions did not differ significantly between normal and mild preeclamptic patients. None of the patients showed background changes of hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and exudates, or evidence of choroidal ischemia (including Elschnig's spots and retinal detachment). In contrast to previous reports, the role of the ophthalmologist in the diagnosis and management of preeclampsia appears to be limited.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia continues to be a challenge--to understand the underlying pathogenesis and to prevent or treat in the clinical setting. One area of potential therapies opening up is treatment of maternal lipids and clinical trials are underway using statins in early pre-eclampsia. At present, most potential therapies to treat lipids cannot be recommended for general use in pregnancy and if we were to target maternal lipids to reduce rates of pre-eclampsia, very large numbers of women may need to be treated. Prior to reaching that point, we first need to understand whether maternal lipids are pathogenic in the processes underlying pre-eclampsia. The aim of this review is to examine the role of lipids in the pathogenesis and outcomes of pre-eclampsia, how abnormal lipid genes may be implicated and consider whether treatment of hyperlipidemia has a more general place in the prevention or treatment of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Incomplete spiral artery remodelling is the first of two stages of pre-eclampsia, typically of early onset. The second stage comprises dysregulated uteroplacental perfusion and placental oxidative stress. Oxidatively stressed syncytiotrophoblast (STB) over-secretes proteins that perturb maternal angiogenic balance and are considered to be pre-eclampsia biomarkers. We propose that, in addition and more fundamentally, these STB-derived proteins are biomarkers of a cellular (STB) stress response, which typically involves up-regulation of some proteins and down-regulation of others (positive and negative stress proteins respectively). Soluble vascular growth factor receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1) and reduced growth factor (PlGF) then exemplify positive and negative STB stress response proteins in the maternal circulation. Uncomplicated term pregnancy is associated with increasing sVEGFR-1 and decreasing PlGF, which can be interpreted as evidence of increasing STB stress. STB pathology, at or after term (for example focal STB necrosis) demonstrates this stress, with or without pre-eclampsia. We review the evidence that when placental growth reaches its limits at term, terminal villi become over-crowded with diminished intervillous pore size impeding intervillous perfusion with increasing intervillous hypoxia and STB stress. This type of STB stress has no antecedent pathology, so the fetuses are well-grown, as typifies late onset pre-eclampsia, and prediction is less effective than for the early onset syndrome because STB stress is a late event. In summary, abnormal placental perfusion and STB stress contribute to the pathogenesis of early and late onset pre-eclampsia. But the former has an extrinsic cause - poor placentation, whereas the latter has an intrinsic cause, 'microvillous overcrowding', as placental growth reaches its functional limits. This model explains important features of late pre-eclampsia and raises questions of how antecedent medical risk factors such as chronic hypertension affect early and late sub-types of the syndrome. It also implies that all pregnant women may be destined to get pre-eclampsia but spontaneous or induced delivery averts this outcome in most instances.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia (PE) is a deadly gestational disease affecting up to 10% of women and specific of the human species. Preeclampsia is clearly multifactorial, but the existence of a genetic basis for this disease is now clearly established by the existence of familial cases, epidemiological studies and known predisposing gene polymorphisms. PE is very common despite the fact that Darwinian pressure should have rapidly eliminated or strongly minimized the frequency of predisposing alleles. Consecutive pregnancies with the same partner decrease the risk and severity of PE. Here, we show that, due to this peculiar feature, preeclampsia predisposing-alleles can be differentially maintained according to the familial structure. Thus, we suggest that an optimal frequency of PE-predisposing alleles in human populations can be achieved as a result of a trade-off between benefits of exogamy, importance for maintaining genetic diversity and increase of the fitness owing to a stable paternal investment.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although knowledge of the precise aetiology remains uncertain a number of risk factors have been described. Thrombophilias have been associated with pre-eclampsia in a number of studies and it is biologically plausible that they may contribute to the uteroplacental thrombosis that is frequently seen in pre-eclampsia. If this association is confirmed, there is the potential to investigate preventive treatments, including low-molecular-weight heparins, aspirin and folate.",preeclampsia
"This study analyzes 13 cases of pregnant women affected by varying degrees of preeclampsia, and correlates the patients' data (height, weight, preeclampsia symptoms according to intensity and time of onset) to the amount of mean daily intake of nutrients (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, starch, total calories, Na). The amount of nutrients was obtained processing with a special computer software the patients' weekly dietary diaries. The analysis of the data shows the correlation between the onset of preeclampsia symptomatology and the excess of certain nutrients: excess in calories and/or proteins, and/or lipids, and/or simple sugars, and/or sodium. A reduction in the amount of these nutrients, especially proteins and Na when applied during the early stage of preeclampsia symptoms, favours the disappearance of the clinical signs of the disease.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia affects two patients, the mother and the fetus. Traditionally, women with severe preeclampsia have been delivered without delay, regardless of fetal considerations. Although delivery is appropriate therapy for the mother, aggressive management with immediate delivery of a fetus remote from term leads to high neonatal mortality and morbidity resulting from prematurity. Recent studies have shown favorable neonatal outcomes after conservative management of severe preeclampsia. Candidates for conservative management should be selected carefully and managed with intensive maternal and fetal monitoring at a tertiary perinatal center.",preeclampsia
"Although the precise pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia remains unknown, this condition continues to be a major cause of maternal and fetal mortality. Early prediction of pre-eclampsia would allow for timely initiation of preventive therapy. A combination of biophysical and biochemical markers are superior to other tests for early prediction of the development of pre-eclampsia. Apart from the use of parameters in first-trimester aneuploidy screening, cell-free fetal DNA quantification is emerging as a promising marker for prediction of pre-eclampsia. This article reviews the current research of the most important strategies for prediction of pre-eclampsia, including the use of maternal risk factors, mean maternal arterial pressure, ultrasound parameters, and biomarkers.",preeclampsia
"Hypertension occurs in 6-8% of pregnancies, preeclampsia in 2%, found to be ""severe"" in 0.6%. Preeclampsia remains a major cause of foetal, and even maternal, mortality. Two different aspects are described: ""maternal"" preeclampsia is related to pre-existent vascular lesions in the mother, ""placental"" preeclampsia is due to a primary defect in early placentation. The earliest disorder seems to be a ""materno-foetal immune maladaptation"", characterized by a defective cooperation between uterine NK cells and foetal HLA-C. Defective angiogenesis is also involved, which has been accounted for by an abnormal production of soluble receptors for angiogenic factors and TGF-beta. The resulting placental ischemia is responsible for an increased shedding of trophoblastic debris in the maternal circulation, an inflammatory syndrome, and finally generalized endothelial dysfunction, which is the clue to maternal symptoms. Clinical presentations range from benign isolated hypertension to life-threatening severe preeclampsia, which entails a major risk of maternal complications and foetal death. Antihypertensive treatment does not improve the foetal or maternal prognosis, in spite of blood pressure lowering. Very early preventive treatments have been developed, which seem largely more promising. Research is very active in this field. Finally, women who had preeclampsia are more prone to future hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or coronary disease.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a disease of unknown etiology and a major contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. With severe preeclampsia, numerous factors including intravascular volume depletion and susceptibility of developing pulmonary edema complicate anesthetic management. Invasive monitors such as CVP or PA pressure measurements are often required for guiding fluid management. When possible, lumbar epidural blockade is the preferred method for providing analgesia and anesthesia. Under all circumstances, a collegial and collaborative approach between obstetrician and anesthesiologist facilitates optimum patient care.",preeclampsia
"Mitochondria are extensively identified for their bioenergetic capacities; however, recently these metabolic hubs are increasingly being appreciated as critical regulators of numerous cellular signalling systems. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species have evolved as a mode of cross-talk between mitochondrial function and physiological systems, to sustain equipoise and foster adaption to cellular stress. Redox signalling mediated by exaggerated mitochondrial-ROS (reactive oxygen species) has been incriminated in a plethora of disease pathologies. Excessive production of mitochondrial ROS is intrinsically linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction is a key facilitator of oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and metabolism. These are key pathogenic intermediaries of pre-eclampsia, hence we hypothesize that mitochondrial dysfunction is a pathogenic mediator of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. We hypothesize that mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants may restrain production of ROS-mediated deleterious redox signalling pathways. If our hypothesis proves correct, therapeutic strategies directly targeting mitochondrial superoxide scavenging should be actively pursued as they may alleviate maternal vascular dysfunction and dramatically improve maternal and fetal health worldwide.",preeclampsia
"Women who have or develop high blood pressure during pregnancy are all at increased risk of complications antenatally, intrapartum and in the puerperium. The increased risk applies to the mother as well to the fetus. Preeclampsia is the most serious form of hypertensive pregnancy complications. Preeclampsia is, however, not primarily a hypertensive disease but a disorder induced by factors dependent on the presence of placenta. The prime target of the placenta dependent factors is the vascular endothelium. Therefore the complications are associated with the vascular system, i.e. intravascular coagulation, bleeding and organ failure following poor perfusion. The fetus is at increased risk due to growth retardation and hypoxia following placental damage. Treatment of the hypertension is first indicated if the blood pressure rises to a level of increased risk of cerebral vascular complications, i.e. above 105-110 mmHg. Delivery is the only causal treatment and is always indicated if severe maternal or fetal complications develop.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a multisystemic disorder of human pregnancy, clinically characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, oedema and platelet aggregation; the syndrome includes vasoconstriction, resulting in maternal hypertension, reduced uterine blood flow, impairment of placenta-vascular endothelial integrity with increased permeability and activation of the coagulation cascade. The aetiopathogenesis of PE remains still unknown, although the central role played by the placenta seems to be crucial. To date, increasing efforts are trying to create an unique and robust biochemical pattern in serum to predict PE. Although the recent data, the definition of an early biochemical pattern in serum to predict PE is still far from reaching the final shape. This stalemate could be due, at least in part, to lack of robust and reproducible methodology (inclusion/exclusion criteria during enrolment, period and type of sample collection, type of sample analysis and interpretation of results) across the different studies. Considering these assumptions, the aim of the current paper is to review the available data about early serum markers of PE.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy specific syndrome that is a principal cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, accounting for almost 15% of pregnancy associated deaths, and is one of the major causes of iatrogenic prematurity among new born babies. The mild form of pre-eclampsia most commonly presents with the features of maternal hypertension and proteinuria, but can swiftly and unpredictably become severe with numerous multisystem complications involving the maternal liver, kidneys, lungs, blood and platelet coagulation and nervous systems. The diverse symptoms of pre-eclampsia have made it a difficult disease not only to define, but also to identify a causative agent for the symptoms. This review examines the complex endocrinological mechanisms believed to be responsible for the extensive complications of pre-eclampsia from the role of placental and endothelial dysfunction, to the causes of the oxidative stress and the ensuing general inflammation. It also highlights current endocrine findings that exhibit the potential for clinical application, as either potential markers or novel therapeutic targets, with the aim of either preventing or altering the course of this life-threatening disease of pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"Is preeclampsia a new cardiovascular and end-stage renal diseases risk marker? Preeclampsia is a major obstetrical problem leading to high maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria occurring after 20 weeks of gestation. Increasing evidence indicates that preeclampsia is not just a pregnancy disease that resolves at the time of delivery, but represent a risk marker of cardiovascular and end-stage renal diseases later in life. The underlying link between preeclampsia and cardiovascular disease is unclear. Women with early onset/severe preeclampsia, recurrent preeclampsia, or preeclampsia with onset as a multipara appear to be at highest risk of cardiovascular disease later in life, including during the premenopausal period.",preeclampsia
"The focus of this article is to review and challenge some current concepts surrounding the diagnosis and management of pre-eclampsia as well as considering where our management might head in the future. Pre-eclampsia is a syndrome defined by the new onset of hypertension in the 2nd half of pregnancy that is generally, but not always, accompanied by proteinuria. Whilst in recent times our understanding and management of this condition have improved there are some areas where evidence and opinions differ. In this review we will discuss the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and the concept of the 'atypical' presentation. We will outline how to identify those women with pre-eclampsia who will have a poorer pregnancy outcome. We will address the question of when to deliver and how to treat if we decide to prolong the pregnancy. Finally we acknowledge that pre-eclampsia is more than a disorder of pregnancy and has lifelong implications for the mother and infant.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia remains a major burden of disease, accounting for approximately 50,000-70,000 maternal deaths each year worldwide. Frustratingly, the management of pre-eclampsia has remained essentially unchanged for much of the last century and focussed primarily on maternal blood pressure control to allow fetal maturation. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia and the elucidation of distinct underlying mechanisms offer the genuine prospect of new and effective therapies that may transform outcomes for millions of women and their babies.",preeclampsia
"Objective: The aim of our study was to determine if fetal DNA is present in the maternal circulation in early pregnancy before the clinical manifestation of preeclampsia, and if this could be predictive of the development of preeclampsia. Study design: Blood were obtained from patients attending for a first antenatal visit. Cases were asymptomatic women who subsequently developed preeclampsia matched to control women for parity and gestational age. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using TaqMan primers and probes directed against SRY gene sequences quantified fetal DNA in the maternal circulation. Results: There were 88 cases of women with preeclampsia and 176 control women, both sampled at a mean gestation (+/-SD) of 15.7 +/- 3.6 weeks. The presence of fetal DNA in the maternal circulation in early pregnancy is associated with an 8-fold increased risk of developing preeclampsia. Conclusion: Increased fetal DNA is present in the maternal circulation in early pregnancy in women who subsequently develop pre-eclampsia and there appears to be a graded response between the quantity of fetal DNA and the risk of developing pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a common and potentially dangerous disorder of human pregnancy. The maternal syndrome of hypertension, proteinuria and oedema is part of a severe systemic inflammatory response that includes leukocyte and endothelial cell activation. Although the origins of pre-eclampsia remain unclear, a major cause is the failure to develop an adequate blood supply to the placenta, leading to placental oxidative stress. This results in the excess release of placental factors, such as syncytiotrophoblast debris or soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), the soluble receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), into the maternal circulation, where they trigger an inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction. Alternatively, pre-eclampsia can develop in the presence of a normal placenta in women that are susceptible to systemic inflammation, such as with chronic cardiovascular disease or diabetes. While clinical management of pre-eclampsia does not currently include anti-inflammatory agents, current research is focusing on ways to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To examine the management of early-onset preeclampsia and its maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Design: Retrospective cohort study of 49,812 births at a university teaching hospital between June 1986 and March 1997. Seventy-one women were identified with a diagnosis of preeclampsia with an onset at less than 30 completed weeks of gestation. Results: The incidence of very preterm preeclampsia was 1 in 682 total births. The mean diagnosis to delivery interval (range) was 14 days (0-49 days). There were no maternal deaths. Fifteen women (21%) had developed HELLP/ELLP syndrome, 9 (13%) had renal failure, 1 (1.4%) had eclampsia, and 11 (15%) had an abruption. Five women (7%) had a termination of pregnancy, 57 (80%) were delivered by cesarean section, and 4 (5%) required a classical incision. There were 12 intrauterine deaths (16%), 9 neonatal deaths (12%), and 52 neonatal survivors (72%). Two of the survivors were known to have neurological impairment at the 2-year follow-up. Conclusions: A conservative approach to the management of early-onset preeclampsia results in a good obstetric outcome for the majority of fetuses, but this must be balanced against the significant risk of morbidity to the mothers.",preeclampsia
"1. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder of human pregnancy with a genetic predisposition. It occurs more commonly in first pregnancies and primarily affects maternal renal, cerebral, hepatic and clotting functions while elevating blood pressure. The foetus is affected through placental insufficiency arising from abnormal 'placentation', that is, failure to adequate trophoblast invasion of maternal vasculature, and possible from abnormal autacoid production. 2. Pre-eclampsia is caused by the placenta; delivery of the placenta is the only known cure. Its manifestations are considered secondary to organ hypoperfusion which arises as a result of vasoconstriction, intravascular coagulation and reduced maternal blood volume. 3. Current hypotheses propose that pre-eclampsia is due to widespread maternal endothelial cell damage, perhaps secondary to a cytotoxic factor released by the placenta. This hypothesis has gained wide acceptance, but scientific evidence is lacking. 4. Defining the abnormal balance of vasoactive factors in pre-eclampsia has proved a difficult task. There is enhanced pressor activity to infused angiotensin II (AII) despite reduced plasma concentrations of AII, renin and aldosterone. Prostacyclin production appears reduced, and the balance of thromboxane/prostacyclin favours vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. There is no convincing evidence for enhanced endothelin or reduced nitric oxide production. Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide are paradoxically elevated in the face of plasma volume contraction. An intriguing observation, which remains unexplained, is why some vascular beds are affected predominantly in one patient (eg. hepatic ischaemia) while another has a similar degree of hypertension but involvement of a different organ system (eg. renal insufficiency yet normal liver function). 5. Volume homeostasis is disturbed with redistribution of intravascular volume to the interstitial fluid space due to increased capillary permeability and in some cases reduced plasma oncotic pressure. This redistribution is not always clinically apparent as peripheral oedema. Whether this change in volume is compensated for by venoconstriction and maintenance of adequate cardiac output is undetermined. 6. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia is necessary to allow better clinical management of this serious disorder.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia is a progressive, multisystem disorder characterised by hypertension and proteinuria. A body of evidence suggest a genetic basis; it is generally accepted that the underlying pathological processes are in the placenta. Material and methods: This article is a review of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia based on literature mainly obtained through PubMed and Medline searches. Results: A poorly perfused placenta, secondary to defective placental invasion of the spiral arteries, may lead to hypoxia and insufficient perfusion and cause release of cytokines which damage endothelial cells and cause dysfunction. Women with preeclampsia have markedly elevated concentrations of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Lipid peroxidation also causes endothelial dysfunction and thus contributes to preeclampsia. Placenta is one source of the lipid peroxides. Antioxidant deficiency is also a predisposing factor. Hyperhomocysteinaemia, protein S and protein C deficiency, and activated protein C resistance appear to be involved in the pathophysiology of severe preeclampsia and early onset preeclampsia. Interpretation: The new information about mechanisms for development of preeclampsia gives a basis for new treatment modalities.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia, a syndrome of pregnant women, is one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Despite active research, the etiology of this disorder remains an enigma. Recent work has, however, provided promising explanations for the causation of the disorder and some of its phenotypes. Evidence indicates that the symptoms of hypertension and proteinuria, upon which the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is based, have several underlying causes. Nevertheless, the treatment of pre-eclampsia has not changed significantly in over 50 years. This review describes the most recent insights into the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia from both basic and clinical research, and attempts to provide a unifying hypothesis to reconcile the abnormalities at the feto-placental level and the clinical features of the maternal syndrome. The novel findings outlined in this review provide a rationale for potential future prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the western world. Due to advancements in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment, cardiovascular mortality has fallen in recent years. Previous studies have evaluated the impact of traditional risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia and smoking. However, limited studies have been conducted to evaluate sex discrepancies among patients with cardiovascular disease. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem placentally mediated disease, which usually arises after 32 weeks of gestation and classically presents with hypertension and proteinuria. Pre-eclampsia affects 2% to 8% of all pregnancies worldwide and is often complicated by fetal growth restriction. Women with a history of pre-eclampsia are at increased risk of future cardiovascular complications. Therefore, this topic is of significance to the cardiovascular health of over 300 million women worldwide. The goal of this review is to determine the association of pre-eclampsia and future cardiovascular risk and to explore the potential management options for these high-risk women.",preeclampsia
Cranial nerves palsy associated with preeclampsia is reported in literature. Facial and abducens palsies were the most nerve disorders described. Only eleven cases have been reported in the literature. We report the case of a 27-years-old patient who presented abducens nerve palsy in immediately after the delivery of severe pre-eclampsia. No specific pathology was found. Symptoms of abducens nerve palsy have resolved spontaneously by controlling blood pressure after delivery.,preeclampsia
"Despite being one of the leading causes of maternal death and a major contributor of maternal and perinatal morbidity, the mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia have yet to be fully elucidated. However, it is evident that this is a complex disorder involving multiple organ systems, and by using integrative approaches, enormous progress has been made towards understanding the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. Growing evidence supports the concept that the placenta plays a central role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia and that reduced uteroplacental perfusion, which develops as a result of abnormal cytotrophoblast invasion of spiral arterioles, triggers the cascade of events leading to the maternal disorder. Placental ischaemia leads to release of soluble placental factors, many of which are classified as anti-angiogenic or pro-inflammatory. Once these ischaemic placental factors reach the maternal circulation, they cause widespread activation and dysfunction of the maternal vascular endothelium that results in enhanced formation of endothelin-1 and superoxide, increased vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II and decreased formation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide. This review highlights these links between placental ischaemia, maternal endothelial activation and renal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of hypertension in pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a disease of many risk factors and theoretical speculations. It is, for unknown reasons, more prevalent among primiparous women. Some observations show that a change of sexual partner before the next pregnancy increases the risk, but this association disappears when correction is made for time interval since the last birth. Risk factors may be pregnancy-specific, such as twinning or mole, whereas others are linked to the woman, such as obesity and diabetes. Genetic risk factors are being searched for, but as yet with relatively little success. A previous pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia is probably the strongest risk factor. For practical purposes, women at increased risk can be identified and should be followed closely. No effective primary preventative action is available. Prevention of the serious consequences of pre-eclampsia still relies on early detection of increases in blood pressure and proteinuria.",preeclampsia
"The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) remain one of the major causes of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Many international guidelines exist for the classification and assessment of women with hypertension in pregnancy, but definitions and recommendations within these documents are variable. Many recommended investigations do not actually correlate with increased risk of adverse outcomes, making it difficult to determine true prognosis. Although standardised assessment and surveillance has been shown to improve outcomes, the application of these monitoring strategies in many areas of the world is not possible owing to the cost associated with them. Not all of the tests recommended for surveillance of women with pre-eclampsia are independently predictive of adverse outcomes, and many unnecessary tests could be avoided if those tests that are most informative where identified. The Pre-eclampsia Integrated Estimate of RiSk study has identified a group of tests that can be used to predict risk of outcomes accurately up to 7 days after admission to a tertiary hospital with pre-eclampsia. This model needs to be validated in new populations and in different clinical settings before it can be implemented into clinical practice. Until this happens, clinicians should consider the whole clinical picture when assessing women with pre-eclampsia and making decisions around expectant management compared with stabilisation and delivery. Future research in the area of prognosis should focus on women with variable definitions of pre-eclampsia and the other HDP. All studies reviewed were limited to cases of severe pre-eclampsia, and results may not be generalisable across the spectrum of the disorder.",preeclampsia
"The pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia remains poorly understood. Moreover, there is no reliable predictive test and no effective prophylactic therapy for this disease. Advances have, however, recently been made in our understanding of the genetics of pre-eclampsia and in the processes which lead to abnormal trophoblastic invasion in pre-eclampsia. Prediction and prevention are intimately linked, and both problems will only be solved by further unravelling of the complex pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a condition that complicates 3-6% of pregnancies. At present, there is no FDA approved diagnostic method to evaluate risk or progression. We would like to report our observation of elevated levels of the spiral steroid phosphoester precursor in patients with pre-eclampsia. Samples from 20 normotensive pregnant women and from 20 women with pre-eclampsia were purchased from Global Alliance for the Prevention of Prematurity and Stillbirth (GAPPS). After addition of miltefosine (hexadecyl phosphocholine) as an internal control, each sample was extracted and evaluated by tandem MS. The method detected 2 spiral steroid phosphoesters and their common precursor. For each mass ion, the ion counts obtained were compared to the ion counts of miltefosine. The samples from the normotensive women were used to establish the mean and standard deviation. Then, Z-scores were determined for each of the serum components. Of the samples from the women with pre-eclampsia, 12 of 19 (63%) samples had Z-scores over 2.0 for at least one of the steroid phosphoesters. In contrast, current markers under development for risk of pre-eclampsia have prediction scores ranging from 8 to 33%. As the spiral steroids are lactones, similar to spironolactone and related compounds, they could function as endogenous potassium sparing hormones. However, as only about half of the affected patients had elevated levels of the spiral steroids, it may not be the only underlying pathology. Parturition would end transfer of placental spiral steroids and account for the termination of the symptoms of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia. Previous investigators have proposed inadequate placental function as the critical pathology of pre-eclampsia, but it is hard to imagine how inadequate placental function leads to the maternal pathology without invoking an endogenous potassium sparing hormone originating in the placenta.",preeclampsia
"Background: One of the challenges for treating pre-eclampsia and preventing further deterioration is determining how best to enable early detection. If women or their partners and families are able to raise early warnings about potential signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia in pregnancy, birth and in the postnatal period, women may be able to receive earlier intervention to prevent severe pre-eclampsia from developing. The aim of this study was to improve understanding of factors affecting the ability of women to recognise symptoms and signs of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia and seek appropriate medical help and factors affecting health care professionals' responses to women and their families who 'speak up' about early warning signs and symptoms. Methods: A narrative synthesis was conducted of evidence relevant to address the research question. The following electronic data bases were searched for qualitative studies which met inclusion criteria from January 1980 to April 2016; Medline, CINAHL, HMIC, PsycINFO, Embase, BNI, ASSIA, Scopus, Maternity and Infant Care, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Cochrane, JBI and IBSS with the support of an Information Service Consultant. Results: Following thematic analysis, three themes were identified; 1: Women's understanding and knowledge of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia; 2: Factors affecting help seeking behaviour from perspectives of women and their families'; 3: Factors affecting staff response. There was widespread lack of knowledge and understanding of signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia among women and their families, with some women not exhibiting signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia or unable to distinguish them from 'normal' pregnancy changes. Conclusions: Women and their families not only need to be made aware of signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia but also require information on the most effective ways to seek urgent medical assessment and care. Some women did not experience prodromal signs and symptoms, which raises concerns about how women and families can detect early onset, and is an issue which needs further exploration. There is very limited research exploring clinical staff response to women who raise concerns about their health when experiencing symptoms and signs of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia with further research needed if safety and quality of care are to be improved.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia remain one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. They also contribute to perinatal morbidity and mortality as well. Multiple strategies have been proposed for the prevention of pre-eclampsia, with mixed results. Likewise, different strategies for the management of pre-eclampsia have been proposed, also with mixed results. While the prevention of pre-eclampsia remains unachievable, meticulous medical management of mother and fetus will contribute to an overall lowering of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia's contribution to perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality.",preeclampsia
"Purpose: Hypertension occurs in 10 to 15 p cent of pregnancies. Among them, 10 to 20% also have proteinuria. This situation defines preeclampsia, and involves a serious threat on fetal and even maternal prognosis. Presence of the hepatic (HELLP) syndrome still severely worsens the prognosis. Current knowledge and key points: Pathophysiology of preeclampsia is based on a very early abnormality of placentation, leading to insufficient blood supply to the feto-placental unit. At the maternal level, the main consequence of placental ischemia is generalized endothelial dysfunction, responsible for systemic vasoconstriction and clotting abnormalities. In such a context, lowering blood pressure with drugs is quite inefficient, or even harmful. The prognosis of this disease is mainly related to the pertinence of obstetrical management. Future prospects and projects: An early preventive strategy is the most logical approach of preeclampsia, its modalities remain under discussion.",preeclampsia
"The incidence of pre-eclampsia ranges from 3% to 7% for nulliparas and 1% to 3% for multiparas. Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, preterm birth, perinatal death, and intrauterine growth restriction. Unfortunately, the pathophysiology of this multisystem disorder, characterized by abnormal vascular response to placentation, is still unclear. Despite great polymorphism of the disease, the criteria for pre-eclampsia have not changed over the past decade (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg and 24-hour proteinuria ≥ 0.3 g). Clinical features and laboratory abnormalities define and determine the severity of pre-eclampsia. Delivery is the only curative treatment for pre-eclampsia. Multidisciplinary management, involving an obstetrician, anesthetist, and pediatrician, is carried out with consideration of the maternal risks due to continued pregnancy and the fetal risks associated with induced preterm delivery. Screening women at high risk and preventing recurrences are key issues in the management of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Selected articles on hypertensive diseases in pregnancy from the past year are highlighted. The concept that endothelial cell dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia has been strengthened. The initial inciting event is still unclear, but inadequate implantation and decreased antioxidant activity may play a role. Magnesium sulfate is still the anticonvulsant of choice for seizure prophylaxis, but the exact mechanism of its action remains controversial. The ideal screening test to identify those patients likely to develop preeclampsia is still lacking, and the side effects and risks of aspirin prophylaxis are not yet known. The results from the National Institutes of Health-sponsored multicenter trial on this subject should be forthcoming.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia-eclampsia is a syndrome which covers the area of influence belonging to gynecologists-obstetricians. However the internists, especially those who work as consultants in obstetric departments, are interested in diagnostics and therapy of this problem as well. Though internists working in the outdoor-departments do not face the problems of preeclampsia so often, it will be usefull to inform them about the latest trends in diagnostics and therapy ofthis syndrome, which may be very risky in pregnancy. The physicians in general (except the gynecologists) consider preeclampsia mostely as one form of hypertension that appears sometimes during gravidity and they do not realy appreciate the complex danger ofthis illness for the both, mother and child. The objective ofthis paper is to inform the general medical public, especially the internists and general practitioners about the modern view ofthe main problems of preeclampsia e.g. the pathogenesis, diagnostics and the up to day therapy of this high risky syndrome joined with pregnancy.",preeclampsia
Three cases of myasthenia gravis in pregnancy are presented. In 2 cases there were moderately severe hypertension or preeclampsia and difficulty in controlling the myasthenia symptoms. The other case was uncomplicated. The possible relationship between myasthenia gravis and preeclampsia is discussed.,preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a frequent, unpredictable syndrome which is dangerous for both mother and foetus. The concept of placental ischemia has gained wide acceptance among the numerous theories put forward to explain the illness. The setting up of preeclampsia seems to be scheduled in two steps: (1) an absolute or relative placental ischemia due to vascular diseases or hypertrophic placenta, or most often secondary to implantation defect, particularly anomaly with the invasive trophoblast; (2) a diffuse endothelial disease. The connection between these two steps is incompletely disclosed. The authors demonstrate that the maternal immune system which is strongly stressed during all the stages of normal gestation is implicated in pre-eclampsia. Its role is probably not univocal. Foeto-trophoblastic antigens could be poorly recognised. This defect of recognition could lead to the abnormalities of trophoblastic invasion observed in pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia does not seem to be accompanied by an immunological rejection of the foetus. Some genetically predisposed patients do not have a sufficiently competent immune system to neutralise one or more of the toxic products released by the ischemic placenta. Certain types of pre-eclampsia could be auto-immune, with the auto-antibodies directed against certain types of phospholipids or trophoblastic constituents. A disequilibrium between oxidation and anti-oxidation mechanisms involving neutrophils could lead to aggression of the endothelium which is observed in pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia could represent a form of immuno-dystrophy, with the excessive production of adverse cytokines locally, directed against the trophoblast. Without directly implicating the immune system as the trigger of pre-eclampsia, it seems that its role is unclear. In some cases it develops protective mechanisms which, when overwhelmed or inadequate, allows pre-eclampsia to occur. In other cases it can form part of the cascade of aggressions leading to the abnormalities encountered. The integration of these abnormalities in the pathophysiological models, could help improve the classification of pre-eclampsia. This attempt will lead to a more adapted preventive and therapeutic management of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"After more than a century of intensive research, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia remain an enigmatic set of conditions. Aberration of the interaction between placental and maternal tissue is probably the primary cause, but the exact nature of the differences from normal pregnancy remain elusive. In this review attempts to understand the sequence of physiological changes have concentrated on vascular endothelium and oxidative stress issues. There are genetic components to susceptibility, but the relative contributions of maternal and fetal genotypes are still unclear. Whole-genome mapping could ultimately define the causative genes.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The exact prevalence, however, is unknown. The majority of pre-eclampsia related deaths in LMIC occur in the community and therefore, interventions must be focused at this level. There are a number of unique challenges facing LMIC but the principles of care for women with pre-eclampsia remain the same as in well resourced settings. Three primary delays lead to an increased incidence of maternal mortality from pre-eclampsia- delays in triage, transport and treatment. There are a number of other challenges facing LMIC and the health care worker shortage is particularly significant. Task shifting is a potential strategy to address this challenge. Community health care workers, specifically lady health care workers, are an integral part of the health care force in many LMIC and can be employed to provide timely care to women with pre-eclampsia. Prevention strategies should be applied to every pregnant woman since we cannot predict who will develop pre-eclampsia given the limitation in resources. Aspirin and calcium are the only two recommended therapies at this time. Measuring blood pressure and proteinuria is challenging in LMIC due to financial cost and lack of training. A detection tool that is affordable and can be easily applied is needed. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclampsia but it is underutilized due to barriers on multiple levels.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is usually defined on the basis of new onset hypertension and albuminuria developing after 20 weeks of pregnancy. There are difficulties with measurement of these variables. Conventional sphygmomanometry remains the gold standard for blood-pressure measurement. The value of ambulatory blood-pressure measurement has yet to be established. Oedema is now omitted from all definitions of preeclampsia, although the finding of widespread severe oedema of sudden onset should not be ignored for clinical purposes. Definitions of pre-eclampsia based solely on hypertension and proteinuria ignore the wide clinical variability in this syndrome. Women with no proteinuria but who do have hypertension and other features such as severe headache or other symptoms, thrombocytopenia, hyperuricaemia, disordered liver function, and fetal compromise are likely to have pre-eclampsia. This notion is accepted in the new Australasian definition of pre-eclampsia and more than hinted at in the new American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' definition. Definitions used for clinical purposes should be as safe as practical; they are likely to include a considerable number of false positives. Most research studies are weakened if patients without the disease are included. Therefore, a separate stringent research definition of pre-eclampsia we also suggest.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is associated with increased maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Early recognition of women at risk of pre-eclampsia will enable the identification of high-risk women who may benefit from enhanced surveillance and prophylaxis. In this chapter, we summarise the accuracy of various tests used to predict the onset of pre-eclampsia and the effectiveness of preventative treatment. The tests used to predict pre-eclampsia include clinical history, examination findings, laboratory and haemodynamic tests. In general, tests in early pregnancy for predicting later development of pre-eclampsia have better specificity than sensitivity, as Body Mass Index greater than 34, alpha-fetoprotein, fibronectin and uterine artery Doppler (bilateral notching) all have specificities above 90%. Only uterine artery Doppler resistance index and combinations of indices have a sensitivity of over 60%. Test such as kallikreinuria not used in clinical practice, has shown high sensitivity above 80%, without compromising specificity, and require further investigation. None of the tests are sufficiently accurate to recommend them for routine use in clinical practice. The various treatment options for preventing pre-eclampsia include pharmacological agents, dietary supplementation and lifestyle modification. Antiplatelet agents, primarily low-dose aspirin, reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia by 10% (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97). Calcium effectively prevents pre-eclampsia (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.65); the beneficial effect being observed in the high-risk group (RR 0.22; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.42) and in the group with low nutritional calcium intake (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.65). Pharmacological agents, such as low molecular weight heparin, progesterone, nitric oxide donors, anti-hypertensive medication and diuretics are not effective in preventing pre-eclampsia. Dietary supplements, such as magnesium, anti-oxidants, marine oils and folic acid, do not reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia. Evidence is lacking to support lifestyle preventative interventions for pre-eclampsia, such as rest, exercise and reduced dietary salt intake.",preeclampsia
"Systemic inflammation and abnormal/poor placentation represent hallmarks of pre-eclampsia. Accumulating evidence suggests that infectious agents might increase the risk of pre-eclampsia; the innate immune defense mechanisms may interact with pro-inflammatory pathways, and contribute to the development of pre-eclampsia. The evidence for this has been supported by indirect epidemiologic and clinical studies, as well as by some direct support from experimental studies. Recent data directly implicate signaling by Toll-like receptors in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia, and establish a crucial link between pre-eclampsia and defense against both foreign pathogens and endogenously generated inflammatory ligands. Here, we review the rapid progress in this field, which has improved our understanding of the interplay between pathogen invasion, innate immune defense mechanisms, and pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia remains an important cause of maternal and perinatal mortality. The ability to predict the most severe forms of pre-eclampsia would allow closer surveillance and earlier intervention to improve outcomes. Although no definitive preventative treatment has been found to date, it is likely that prospective treatments would need to start early in pregnancy to alter pathogenesis. Following recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of this complex syndrome, new predictive tests are being evaluated. The most promising models incorporate biochemical and biophysical tests that combine assessments of placentation and maternal disease susceptibility.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder of pregnancy usually associated with raised blood pressure (BP) and proteinuria. The pathogenesis is not understood despite decades of research. Abnormal placentation related to immune mechanisms and maladaptation of the placenta may be the first step in the development of the disease. Although there are a number of risk factors and new innovatory tests (e.g., uterine artery Doppler) which can be used to predict pre-eclampsia, none fulfils standard diagnostic criteria. Of possible prophylactic value are antiplatelet agents, calcium supplementation and vitamins C and E. Prevention of eclampsia with magnesium sulfate is the subject of a current international randomised controlled trial (RCT), known as MAGPIE. Therapeutic strategies include avoidance of hypertensive injury and delivery of the baby and placenta. Further research into specific antihypertensive agents and conservative management strategies is required.",preeclampsia
"Gordon Smith argues for more and better research in screening for pregnancy outcomes, using the example of previous trials in pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia complicates around 5% of pregnancies and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are responsible for over 60,000 maternal deaths worldwide annually. Identifying women with pre-eclampsia is a major goal of antenatal care in order to target increased surveillance, allow stabilizing therapies to be implemented and to enable timely delivery. Current risk assessment is based on clinical history, imperfect assessment of clinical signs (e.g., hypertension and proteinuria) and nonspecific biochemical markers, all of which are subject to considerable error. This is further confounded by underlying maternal disease such as chronic hypertension or renal pathology. Angiogenic factors reflect the underlying pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia and there is emerging evidence that they can now be used for more accurate risk assessment. The most promising of these factors include placental growth factor and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1. Used at point of care, these can accurately discriminate true disease in suspected cases and subsequent need for delivery.",preeclampsia
"Introduction: Pre-eclampsia and related sequelae are a leading cause of severe maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. A significant proportion of these poor outcomes may be preventable with improvements along the continuum of maternal and neonatal care. Aims: The aim of this study was to review cases of pre-eclampsia resulting in severe maternal morbidity, describing the maternal and neonatal outcomes and the potential preventability of severe maternal morbidity (SMM). Materials and methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of cases of SMM associated with severe pre-eclampsia - a subset of a national SMM review study. Inclusion criteria for this subset were women who were pregnant or within 42 days of delivery with severe pre-eclampsia as the main reason for admission to an intensive care unit or high dependency unit in New Zealand between 1 August 2013 and 31 January 2015 inclusive. A multidisciplinary expert panel reviewed cases for preventability using a validated preventability tool. Results: Of the 89 severe morbidities that were reviewed, 10 had eclampsia (11%) and there were four neonatal mortalities (4.3%). Multidisciplinary committees assessed the severe morbidity as potentially preventable in 31% (28) of cases with the majority due to delays in diagnosis and suboptimal treatment. Conclusion: We found a high level of preventable morbidity in cases of severe pre-eclampsia with a concerning number of preventable eclampsia. Implementation of evidence-based guidelines reinforced with education would assist clinicians to improve risk recognition, timely diagnosis and treatment and decrease potentially preventable severe morbidity associated with pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre‑eclampsia is a common complication during pregnancy, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. The pathogenesis of pre‑eclampsia is not fully understood. Studies on the maternal spiral artery have led scientists to consider that the ineffective infiltration of placental trophoblast cells may be a primary cause of pre‑eclampsia. The present study aimed to investigate the differences in the profiles of long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) between the placentas of patients with pre‑eclampsia and those of healthy pregnant women. The involvement of the differentially expressed lncRNAs in the biological activity of trophoblast cells was also assessed. A total of 26 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified between the pre‑eclampsia and healthy groups. Upregulation of NR_002794 was found in tissues from patients with pre‑eclampsia. In SWAN71 trophoblast cells, NR_002794 had suppressive effects on proliferation and migration, and resulted in an increased rate of apoptosis. Furthermore, lncRNA NR_002794 had no effect on the phagocytosis of trophoblast cells. The present study suggested that abnormal levels of NR_002794 may lead to atypical conditions in trophoblast cells, which may be associated with the failure of maternal spiral artery remodeling during pregnancy and, consequently, with the development of pre‑eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"One of the most frequent causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity is represented by hypertensive disorders during pregnancy. Women at high risk must be subjected to a more intensive antenatal surveillance and prophylactic treatments. Many genetic risk factors, clinical features and biomarkers have been proposed but none of these seems able to prevent pre-eclampsia onset. English literature review of manuscripts focused on calcium intake and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy was performed. We performed a critical analysis of evidences about maternal calcium metabolism pattern in pregnancy analyzing all possible bias affecting studies. Calcium supplementation seems to give beneficial effects on women with low calcium intake. Some evidence reported that calcium supplementation may drastically reduce the percentage of pre-eclampsia onset consequently improving the neonatal outcome. Starting from this evidence, it is intuitive that investigations on maternal calcium metabolism pattern in first trimester of pregnancy could represent a low cost, large scale tool to screen pregnant women and to identify those at increased risk of pre-eclampsia onset. We propose a biochemical screening of maternal calcium metabolism pattern in first trimester of pregnancy to discriminate patients who potentially may benefit from calcium supplementation. In a second step we propose to randomly allocate the sub-cohort of patients with calcium metabolism disorders in a treatment group (calcium supplementation) or in a control group (placebo) to define if calcium supplementation may represent a dietary mean to reduce pre-eclampsia onset and to improve pregnancy outcome.",preeclampsia
"Studies investigating the association between maternal adiposity and risk of pre-eclampsia showed contradictory results. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to estimate the effect of maternal adiposity on pre-eclampsia. We reviewed 1,286 abstracts and finally included 29 prospective cohort studies with 1,980,761 participants and 67,075 pre-eclampsia events. We pooled data with a random-effects model, and obtained risk estimates for five predetermined bodyweight groups: low, normal-weight (reference), overweight, obese and severely obese. In the cohort studies that unadjusted for pre-eclampsia risk factors, the pooled unadjusted relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for pre-eclampsia of overweight, obese and severely obese women were 1.58 (95% CI 1.44-1.72, P < 0.001), 2.68 (95% CI 2.39-3.01, P < 0.001) and 3.12 (95% CI 2.24-4.36, P < 0.001), respectively. In those cohorts that adjusted for pre-eclampsia risk factors, the pooled unadjusted RRs for pre-eclampsia of overweight, obese and severely obese women were 1.70 (95% CI 1.60-1.81, P < 0.001), 2.93 (95% CI 2.58-3.33, P < 0.001) and 4.14 (95% CI 3.61-4.75, P < 0.001), respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed maternal adiposity was associated with increased risk of pre-eclampsia in both nulliparous and multiparas women. In conclusion, overweight or obese pregnant women have a substantially increased risk of pre-eclampsia, and maternal adiposity is an independent risk factor of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Recent observations indicate that pre-eclampsia is a disease, which occurs because of a partially defective maternal immune response against the fetal (paternal) antigen expressed on trophoblast tissue. The resulting defective or insufficient placentation can cause ischaemic changes, which seem to act in a harmful way on the vascular endothelium, initially locally in the utero-placental circulation, but later with universal systemic effects. The resulting endothelial dysfunction and concommitant thrombocyte activation seems to account for an important part of the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. Hypertension is presumably a secondary phenomenon. The definitive treatment of pre-eclampsia is delivery, which is always indicated in cases of severe pre-eclampsia after 32 weeks of pregnancy. In milder cases and before 32 weeks it is reasonable to await delivery, if necessary starting anti-hypertensive treatment. Treatment of hypertension has to balance the risks of maternal cerebral complications against the risks of reduced utero-placental bloodflow with resulting intra-uterine growth retardation. Low-dose acetylsalicylic acid treatment could in theory constitute a prophylactic principle, but the results of new, large, well-conducted, randomised trials advise against using such treatment prophylacctically at present. The effect of fish-oil supplements is not yet clarified, whereas mineral supplements such as calcium and magnesium are unlikely to have prophylactic effects on the development of pre-eclampsia, at least not in western industrialized society.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy deserve special attention in the setting of global public health. Currently, they represent the third cause of maternal mortality in the world and first in Brazil. From a practical standpoint, pre-eclampsia remains a syndrome that leads to serious repercussions on maternal and fetal mortality and its etiology is not well known. Currently, the best treatment for forms of pre-eclampsia is being discussed at different times in pregnancy and puerperium, with the objective to reduce the high rates of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Considering the pathophysiology of the event, anticipation of delivery is the best treatment for pre-eclampsia. The use of magnesium sulfate is recommended in all cases of severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia for prevention and treatment of seizures. Likewise, treatment of hypertensive crises is recommended. Hydralazine, nifedipine and labetalol have been the most commonly used drugs for this purpose, but their use depends on the familiarity of the treating physician. Antenatal corticoid therapy is indicated whenever there is an imminent risk of preterm delivery between 24 and 34 weeks. In contrast, there is insufficient evidence to recommend bed rest and routine plasma volume expansion, and there is an urgent need for randomized clinical trials to determine whether maintenance antihypertensive treatment in pregnant women has benefits or risks for mothers and fetuses in all clinical forms of disease, particularly in cases of pure pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is more than pregnancy induced hypertension. The emerging view described in this presentation is that pre-eclampsia is secondary to the interactions of reduced placental perfusion with diverse maternal factors that alter endothelial function. The maternal contribution is from factors that antedate pregnancy and are influenced by the usual metabolic adaptations of pregnancy. The endothelium and other targets for the effects of these interactions are more sensitive to insults during pregnancy because of activation of the inflammatory cascade as a normal part of pregnancy. At least part of the response to reduced placental perfusion may be a fetal adaptive response to attempt to overcome the reduced delivery of nutrients. A reasonable convergence point for the interaction is at the level of oxidative stress. This hypothesis has both encouraging and discouraging corollaries. The diversity of maternal factors argues that there will be no single gene to explain the disorder and no single 'magic bullet' to treat the disorder. However, it is encouraging that the recognition of maternal predisposition to the disorder directs therapy to prevent pre-eclampsia at a specific target in subsets of women. Finally, the suggestion that some of the maternal alterations are due to fetal adaptive responses encourages careful choices of agents and meticulous infant follow up in well planned clinical trials.",preeclampsia
"Understanding the mechanisms of disease responsible for the syndrome of pre-eclampsia (PE) as well as early risk assessment is still a major challenge. Risk factors for PE are nulliparity, a family or own history of PE, pre-existing diabetes or increased body mass index, multiple pregnancy, maternal age, renal disease, hypertension or raised blood pressure at booking and chronic autoimmune disease. Other factors are thrombophilias and insulin resistance together with obesity. On the other hand identification of predictors of the development of pre-eclampsia would enhance the ability to diagnose women likely to develop pre-eclampsia before the onset of the disease and would improve their monitoring and enable to convey them to randomized trials for evaluating prophylactic treatment. A number of biochemical agents have been assessed as markers for predicting pre-eclampsia. None of them has been proved to be of clinical value yet. Much effort has been put into evaluating novel potential markers and their combination with other screening methods such as Doppler sonography. The most promising biochemical markers, to date, are placenta protein 13 (PP-13) as well as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng). These markers allow screening at a relatively early stage and, most importantly, show relatively high predictive values and improved diagnostic performance if combined with first trimester Doppler sonography. However, until now, too little data are available to justify the clinical use of these markers. Large-scale prospective studies, assessing these markers, are important to advance progress in reducing maternal and perinatal morbidity and relieving the heavy burden of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is a multisystem disease with life-threatening complications requiring expert nursing and medical management. Nurses caring for critically ill patients with this disease must be knowledgeable about the pathophysiologic occurrences of PIH as well as the protocols for anticonvulsant and antihypertensive therapy. This article presents the hemodynamic alterations of preeclampsia, the pathophysiology of the disease, and principles of acute management.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a multi-system disorder of human pregnancy, characterised by hypertension and proteinuria. Although the pathogenesis of PE is not fully understood, predisposition to endothelial dysfunction is thought to play a crucial part. Despite intensive research there is no reliable test for screening purposes or to inform decision making towards effective treatment for PE. Understanding the link between PE, abnormal haemostatic activation and inflammation may help to elucidate some of the patho-physiology of the disease; primary preventative measures and targeted therapies at an early stage of the disease could then be considered. In the present paper we discuss potential causal links between PE, haemostasis and inflammation. The potential implications of such interaction on the pathogenesis of PE are also addressed.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia, a life-threatening disease during pregnancy, is a leading cause of global maternal mortality. Although there is substantial evidence of a genetic background, the complexity of the processes involved and nature of the maternal-fetal phenomenon do not make the search for the causative genes easy. Recent retrospective studies on the subject suggest the heritable allelic variations, particularly the utero-placental renin-angiotensin system with defective placental vascular development, could become the cornerstone for the genetics of pre-eclampsia and hence might well be associated with such defective development. Moreover, the role of immune mechanisms (immune maladaptation) deserves not to be ignored. Large-scale studies entailing genomewide scanning, sib-pair linkage analysis, and family-based association studies with appropriate power to detect genes with a lower relative risk are necessary to understand the puzzle of the disease. Moreover, recently, the importance of epigenetic features and the effect of imprinted genes related to trophoblast growth as well as fetal development on hypertension in pregnancy have been highlighted. All these possibilities are intuitively attractive and are supported by some circumstantial evidence. Although the consistent tenor of a series of papers instill some confidence, we need meticulously designed larger-scale investigations including large numbers of affected women and their babies to provide the analytic stringency essential to study the polygenic multifactorial basis of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"The success of pregnancy is a result of countless ongoing interactions between the placenta and the maternal immune and cardiovascular systems. Pre-eclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication that arises from multiple potential aberrations in these systems. The pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia is established in the first trimester of pregnancy, when a range of deficiencies in placentation affect the key process of spiral artery remodelling. As pregnancy progresses to the third trimester, inadequate spiral artery remodelling along with multiple haemodynamic, placental and maternal factors converge to activate the maternal immune and cardiovascular systems, events which may in part result from increased shedding of placental debris. As we understand more about the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia, it is becoming clear that the development of early- and late-onset pre-eclampsia, as well as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), does not necessarily arise from the same underlying pathology.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia has been dubbed as 'a disease of primiparity'. However, the effects and mechanisms of the association of primiparity with pre-eclampsia have not been clearly defined. We conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating the effect of primiparity on the risk of pre-eclampsia, and studies (published between January 1966 and July 2005) on the mechanisms underlying such an association. A total of 26 original studies were identified and a meta-analysis carried out for the risk of pre-eclampsia among primiparous vs. multiparous women. Variably (1.4-5.5 times) higher risks of pre-eclampsia were observed in primiparous women in all studies, with a summary odds ratio (OR) of 2.42 [95% CI 2.16, 2.71]. The adjusted ORs were larger than crude ORs in all but one study after various adjustments. Except for abundant epidemiological evidence in support of the immune maladaptation theory, only four original studies examined the actual mechanisms of such primiparity-associated risk. Two (small) studies suggested differences in immunological responses in the aetiology of pre-eclampsia in primiparous vs. multiparous women. Two recent studies indicated that differences in angiogenic factor profile or reactivity to insulin resistance in early pregnancy may explain the elevated pre-eclampsia risk in first pregnancies. In conclusion, primiparity is associated with approximately 2.4-fold elevated risk of pre-eclampsia. Although immune maladaptation is generally considered as the basis to explain such an elevated risk, few data are available on immune maladaptation parameters in primiparous vs. multiparous pregnancies. Available data are insufficient to interpret the mechanisms of such primiparity-associated excess risk of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Despite decades of intense research on the problem, pre-eclampsia remains one of the great mysteries of medical science. This paper is an overview of the existing knowledge on the disease that unifies the essential and validated findings of past and current scientific investigation. A key focus has been an attempt to distinguish foundationally pathogenic mechanisms from multiple epiphenomena that continue to be elucidated. The hypothesis was developed after taking into consideration the various known risk factors for pre-eclampsia, epidemiologic trends, and the most available research to date regarding the pathogenesis of the disease. In summary, it may be stated that pre-eclampsia is a systemic disease of maternal endothelial cell dysfunction, resulting from a deficient endovascular invasion of fetal extravillous cytotrophoblasts into the maternal spiral arterioles--a process facilitated by cytokine and angiogenic factor producing uterine/decidual CD56bright Natural Killer (NK) cells and impeded by the more cytotoxic peripheral CD56dim NK cells of the innate immune system. Therefore, the disease process appears to be fundamentally one of a unique variant of immune maladaptation at the level of the maternal-fetal interface in the setting of more or less susceptible persons caused by a mixture of both insufficient maternal tolerance induction to the paternal antigens and unfavourable combinations of genetically determined maternal leukocyte receptors and fetal antigens.",preeclampsia
"We have proposed that the maternal syndrome of pre-eclampsia is caused by a systemic inflammatory response involving both leucocytes and endothelium. This inflammatory response is present also in normal pregnancy, but in a milder form. The inflammatory stimulus is most likely to come from the placenta. Syncytiotrophoblast apoptotic debris, which is shed into the maternal circulation in normal pregnancy and in increased amounts in pre-eclampsia, may be the stimulus for this response. It may also contribute to the suppression of Th1 responses seen in pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia (PE) and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a leading cause of adverse outcomes. Their pathophysiology remains elusive, hampering the development of efficient prevention. The onset of HDP and PE and the severity of their clinical manifestations are heterogeneous. The advent of preventive measures, such as low-dose aspirin that targets high-risk women, emphasizes the need of better prediction. Until recently, only environmental information and maternal risk factors were considered, with equivocal predictive value. No validated screening procedures were available to identify at-risk women despite the emergence of Doppler ultrasonography parameters for the uterine artery (e.g., pulsatility index and bilateral notching) and pathophysiological biochemical markers (e.g., angiogenesis, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction). Owing to its heterogeneity and lack of specific, sensitive markers among those studied so far (>200), PE is unlikely to be detected early by a single predictive parameter. Systematic reviews have concluded that no single test fulfilling World Health Organization criteria for biomarker selection can diagnose/predict a disease. However, by combining antenatal risk factors, clinical parameters, as well as biophysical and biochemical markers into multivariate algorithms, the risk of PE can be estimated with performance levels that could reach clinical utility. Performance characteristics of selected algorithms will be presented and discussed with respect to transferability to different geographic and healthcare environments.",preeclampsia
"The reason pre-eclampsia matters so much to maternity care providers is that adverse maternal and perinatal events cluster around the diagnosis of proteinuric gestational hypertension. While that is true, most pre-eclampsia is mild and evanescent, resolving rapidly postpartum. Therefore, every effort must be made to identify those women at greatest personal risk, and those bearing fetuses at greatest risk, so that they can be offered closer surveillance and lower thresholds for the use of effective interventions, such as delivery and the use of MgSO(4). Conversely, as delivery remote from term can increase perinatal risks and as liberal MgSO(4) use is associated with maternal morbidity, it may be as important to identify those women who have ""mild"" disease and bear little personal and/or fetal actuarial risk. For women with ""mild"" disease at presentation, expectant management remote from term or nonuse of MgSO(4) would be appropriate. Through the PIERS (Pre-eclampsia Integrated Estimate of RiSk) model research program, we have determined that most criteria for ""severe"" disease perform poorly when operationalized to predict adverse maternal and/or perinatal outcomes. However, with standardized assessment and surveillance of women with suspected and confirmed pre-eclampsia it is possible to lower maternal risks both within individual institutions and across regions. In addition, the PIERS group developed, and is currently validating, 2 outcome prediction models (full-PIERS and mini-PIERS) that we hope will provide an evidence base for the definition of ""severe"" disease and guide clinical decision-making, especially remote from term when potential perinatal gains are so great.",preeclampsia
"Interest has been renewed over the role of uric acid in the pathogenesis of hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and renal dysfunction, which are all features of pre-eclampsia. Uric acid is not a consistent predictive factor for the development of pre-eclampsia but its levels generally increase once the disease manifests, and plasma levels of uric acid approximately correlate with disease severity. Hyperuricemia in pre-eclampsia was once thought to result solely from reduced renal clearance, but levels of uric acid are now also thought to increase through increased uric acid production caused by trophoblast breakdown, cytokine release and ischemia. Uric acid can promote endothelial dysfunction, damage and inflammation, which leads to oxidation. Pre-eclampsia, which is characterized by widespread endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, might be propagated by uric acid through these known in vitro activities. Of note, however, uric acid can also act as a scavenger of oxygen free radicals. Plasma urate measurements are currently used to support the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. As further studies define the role of uric acid in the development of pre-eclampsia, monitoring levels of this factor may again become essential to the future treatment of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To study the relationship between maternal smoking and preeclampsia and whether this association differs between primiparous and multiparous women. Study design: We conducted a population-based, retrospective, cohort study of 58,216 singleton pregnancies from northern and central Alberta, Canada, between 1995 and 1997. Multivariate logistic regression was used to control for maternal alcohol consumption, drug dependence, maternal age, maternal weight, prior intrauterine growth restriction and other confounders. Results: Maternal smoking was associated with a significantly reduced overall risk of preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: .61; 95% confidence interval [CI]: .50-.75; P < .01). Stratified analyses showed that in primiparous pregnancies, maternal smoking was associated with a significantly decreased risk (aOR: .63; 95% CI: .50-.80; P < .01); in multiparous women, maternal smoking was not associated with a statistically significant decreased risk of preeclampsia (aOR: 0.72; 95% CI: .51-1.02; P > .05). Conclusion: Maternal smoking is protective against preeclampsia. Understanding the underlying biologic mechanisms of this protective effect may advance our knowledge of the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease with an incidence of about 5% in primigravidas and, being common, it significantly contributes to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The primary cause remains unknown but might be immunologic, since immunologic aberrations are described in preeclampsia. Activation of the complement system in pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease has been discussed during the last 60 years. It is now strongly indicated that complement activation occurs in preeclampsia. The complement system is very potent and one of the major effector pathways of the process of inflammation. The pathological manifestations, endothelial damage and microvascular injury, and thereby the clinical findings in preeclampsia, may be explained by complement activation, resulting in the direct vascular effects of biological active complement components and complement-mediated activation of leukocytes, with release of potent inflammatory mediators. This new etiological hypothesis might give other options in therapy and prevention of pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a common complication of pregnancy and often manifests in severe cases with neurological symptoms. We present the first documented case of preeclampsia associated with third nerve palsy. A 19-year-old primigravida presented at 31 2/7 weeks' gestation with preeclampsia. In addition to classic preeclampsia symptoms, the patient had atypical visual disturbances. Exhaustive neurological and ophthalmological examinations revealed a third nerve palsy with no etiology other than preeclampsia. Deteriorating renal function necessitated preterm delivery. She ultimately underwent a cesarean section. Two months postpartum, the patient has shown complete spontaneous resolution of third nerve palsy. In this case of severe preeclampsia manifested by third nerve palsy, we hypothesize that the mechanism is attributed to vasospasm of the vessels supplying the oculomotor nerve.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-specific syndrome of unknown etiology, defined by clinical findings of elevated blood pressure combined with proteinuria and oedema. The decidual portion of the spiral arteries of women who later develop pre-eclampsia does not undergo the normal pregnancy-induced remodelling that converts these vessels to high volume-low resistance conduits. We have postulated that this failure leads to vascular spasm, restricted blood flow, placental ischaemia and the release of toxic substances that enter the maternal circulation, resulting in multi-organ disease. The complex and interwoven pathways of endocrine, paracrine and autocrine factors appear to result in a vicious cycle of endothelial cell dysfunction, which is expressed clinically as pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia complicating 3% of all births is an important cause of maternal death and is associated with an increased risks of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Among the numerous theories proposed to explain this syndrome, the concept of placental ischaemia resulting in a generalized disturbance of endothelial physiology is receiving increasing support. Maternal immunological systems is often solicited during normal pregnancy. Most likely the immunological system is implicated in preeclampsia. Its responsibility is protean. Trophoblastic antigens may not be properly recognized by maternal immunologic system, resulting in a defect of trophoblastic invasion of the myometrial segment of the spiral arteries. Preeclampsia does not seem to be accompanied with trophoblast immunological rejection by the mother. Some cases of preeclampsia are associated with autoimmune phenomena. The autoantibodies could be directed against phospholipids or/and trophoblastic membrane components. Activated neutrophils release a variety of substances, capable of mediating vascular damage. An imbalance between the protective antioxidant activity and aggressive oxidant mechanisms could initiate the endothelial lesions. Preeclampsia could be one presentation of immunodystrophism with local excess of harmful cytokines. The immunologic system is probably not the initiator of preeclampsia, but its role is ambiguous: either the protective immunologic mechanisms usually operating during pregnancy can be surpassed, or immunologic responses are inadequate and directly aggressive. A better understanding of the underlying immunologic anomalies will improve the nosologic classification of preeclampsia syndrome.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia remains one of the major obstetrical problems in less-developed countries. The causes of this condition are still unknown, thus effective primary prevention is not possible at this stage. Research in the past decade has identified some major risk factors for pre-eclampsia, and manipulation of these factors might result in a decrease in its frequency. In the early 1990s aspirin was thought to be the wonder drug in secondary prevention of pre-eclampsia. Results of large trials have shown that this is not the case: if there is an indication for using aspirin it is in the patient at a very high risk of developing severe early-onset disease. The calcium story followed a more or less similar pattern, with the difference that existing evidence shows that women with a low dietary calcium intake are likely to benefit from calcium supplementation. Proper antenatal care and timed delivery are of utmost importance in tertiary prevention of pre-eclampsia. There is evidence to suggest that the intrinsic direct effect of moderate degrees of maternal hypertension is beneficial to the fetus. Severe hypertension needs treatment. If antihypertensive is indicated, there is no clear choice of a drug. Hydralazine should no longer be thought of as the primary drug, most studies show a preference for calcium channel blockers.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a potentially life-threatening disease of women during pregnancy leading to hypertension and proteinuria. It affects 1 in 15 pregnancies but, despite intense research efforts, the cause of the disease remains mysterious. Because pre-eclampsia only occurs during pregnancy and its symptoms resolve after delivery, factors from the placenta are thought to be involved. The role of the placenta could be production of 'abnormal' factors that initiate widespread inflammation and vaso-constriction. Alternatively, because the placenta normally contributes to maternal cardiovascular adaptations of pregnancy, it may be that normal placental functions fail in pre-eclampsia or that susceptibilities in the mother to hypertensive, vascular and/or renal disease prevent the appropriate normal responses to them. The potential contributions of both maternal and fetal genes to the onset of the disease have complicated the genetic analysis of the disease in humans. Recent studies have identified strains of transgenic and mutant mice that develop the hallmark features of pre-eclampsia-like disease - gestational hypertension, proteinuria and kidney lesions (glomerulosclerosis). Comparison of three different mouse models suggests that pre-eclampsia can be initiated by at least three independent mechanisms: pre-existing borderline maternal hypertension that is exacerbated by pregnancy (BPH/5 strain of mice), elevated levels of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II in the maternal circulation by placental over-production of renin (renin/angiotensinogen transgenic mice), and placental pathology (p57Kip2 mutant mice). These findings imply that the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia cannot be explained by a single mechanism. Therefore, segregation of the human disease into different subtypes may be a key first step in identifying genetic risk factors.",preeclampsia
"The venous compartment has an important function in regulation and control of cardiac output. Abnormalities of cardiac output have been found in early gestational stages of both early- and late-onset pre-eclampsia. The venous compartment also maintains the balance between circulating and non-circulating blood volumes and regulates the amount of reserve blood stored in the splanchnic venous bed. It is well known that adaptive regulation of maternal blood volume is disturbed in pre-eclampsia. Abnormal venous hemodynamics and venous congestion are responsible for secondary dysfunction of several organs, such as the kidneys in cardiorenal syndrome and the liver in cardiac cirrhosis. Renal and liver dysfunctions are among the most relevant clinical features of pre-eclampsia. Doppler sonography studies have shown that the maternal venous compartment is subject to gestational adaptation, and that blood flow characteristics at the level of renal interlobar and hepatic veins are different in pre-eclampsia compared with uncomplicated pregnancy. In comparison to late-onset pre-eclampsia, in early-onset pre-eclampsia venous Doppler flow abnormalities are more prominent and present up to weeks before clinical symptoms. This paper reviews the growing evidence that dysfunction of maternal venous hemodynamics is part of the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia and may perhaps be more important than is currently considered. Doppler sonography is a safe and easily performed method with which to study maternal venous hemodynamics. Therefore, exploring the role of maternal venous hemodynamics using Doppler sonography is an exciting new research topic for those who are interested in cardiovascular background mechanisms, as well as prediction and clinical work-up of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Physiological adaptations of pregnancy are summarised. Maternal consequences of pre-eclampsia, eclampsia and HELLP syndrome are described. Goals of ITU management are outlined. Directions for future management/therapies are included. The need to integrate technological expertise with sensitive nursing care is emphasised.",preeclampsia
"The etiology of pre-eclampsia, a disorder specific to pregnancy, has not yet been clearly established. Generalized endothelial dysfunction is thought to occur. Inadequate trophoblast invasion at the feto-maternal junction has also been postulated as the cause. However, recent findings are more suggestive of an inappropriate maternal inflammatory response within the framework of placentation, the innate immune system being primarily involved. This exaggerated maternal intravascular inflammatory reaction to the invading trophoblast leads to the manifestations of pre-eclampsia in the mother and feto-placental unit. The extent of the inflammatory reaction, which is also present in normal pregnancy, is probably determined by genetic factors and any pre-existing disorder affecting the mother or fetus. The process is very complex and cannot be attributed to any one single cause.",preeclampsia
"We report a case of preeclampsia presenting initially as a moderate hypertension, and complicated over a ten-day period by eclampsia, retinal hemorrhage, cerebral and hepatic subcapsular hematomas, HELLP syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation and renal failure. Fatal outcome was related to cerebral death and rupture of the liver hematoma. The case analysis points out inaccurate initial management: probable misdiagnosis of epigastric pain related to subcapsular hematoma, ineffective antihypertensive therapy, aspiration of the gastric content after benzodiazepine treatment of eclampsia, transfer of the patient without stabilisation of her clinical status.",preeclampsia
"Developing countries have had persistently higher rates of maternal and child mortality due to pre-eclampsia in comparison with developed countries. Moreover, evidence from studies of interventions to prevent pre-eclampsia have given contradictory results. In this review, we discuss the underlying causes of pre-eclampsia, and the results of clinical trials performed to prevent this disease, that support the proposal that the causes and strategies to prevent pre-eclampsia are different in developed and developing countries. We also suggest that the establishment of an adequate prenatal care is the only effective way to reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia in populations from developing countries, especially in women at high risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension.",preeclampsia
"The central role of the placenta in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia is undisputed. The evidence that maternal syndrome of pre-eclampsia is caused by a maternal systemic inflammatory response (MSIR) is reviewed. The polymorphic nature of the inflammatory network explains the diversity of the varied signs of this condition. A key observation is that an MSIR is also a feature of normal third trimester pregnancy, but less severe than in pre-eclampsia. Hence pre-eclampsia is simply the extreme end of a continuum common to all pregnancies, with multiple contributing factors. Evidence is presented that apoptotic or necrotic debris shed from the syncytial surface of the placenta constitutes the inflammatory stimulus in all pregnancies. This model explains many features of pre-eclampsia including its occurrence with either larger placentae or small oxidatively stressed placentae. The clinical implications are that in terms of diagnosis or prediction there can never be a clear distinction between normal and abnormal. No test, predictive or diagnostic, can be expected to distinguish absolutely between different degrees of a problem that is common to all pregnancies. The possibility that the MSIR associated with third trimester pregnancy is nothing more than the maternal price for sustaining gestation is considered. Insulin resistance is a feature of normal pregnancy and also of systemic inflammatory states in non-pregnant individuals. It has been previously proposed that the insulin resistance of pregnancy is an important adaptation to divert maternal glucose to meet the needs of the foetus. Hence the MSIR, by causing maternal insulin resistance, may have substantial foetal advantages so long as it is not too severe.",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia is strongly associated with hyperuricemia, and in some studies the increase in serum uric acid has been found to correlate with both maternal and fetal morbidity. The hyperuricemia is believed to result primarily from the decreased renal excretion that occurs as a consequence of the pre-eclampsia, and as such is widely viewed as a marker for pre-eclampsia as opposed to having a role in the pathogenesis. Hypothesis: We present the hypothesis that hyperuricemia may also have a contributory role in the development of hypertension and renal disease in these patients, and we review recent experimental data that would support this hypothesis. Recommendation: We suggest that studies addressing the role of uric acid in pre-eclampsia may provide new insights into both the pathogenesis and treatment of this condition.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-associated disease of the second part of the pregnancy, occurring mainly after 20th weeks gestation. The prevalence of hypertension in pregnancy is between 5 to 11% and affects mainly women under 20 years of age. An inadequate invasion of trophoblasts with consequential placental ischemia as a result of insufficiently dilated uterine spiral arteries is thought to be an initial cause in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The clinical symptoms of pre-eclampsia, such as loss of intravascular volume and edema, are caused by generalized endothelial dysfunction. These symptoms are potentiated by hypertension and reduced colloid osmotic pressure in the plama. The organs being affected by pre-eclampsia are those of the vascular-, hepatic-, renal-, cerebral- and coagulatory systems. The prognosis is much more severe when pre-eclampsia develops very early in the pregnancy. The symptoms include elevated blood pressure (over 140 mmHg systolic, 90 mmHg diastolic) combined with proteinuria. Frequent symptoms are hyperreflexia and edema. The etiology of pre-eclampsia has not been clearly defined. Risk factors/triggers for the development of pre-eclampsia can include chronic hypertension, advanced maternal age at first pregnancy (over 35 y), nephropathy, thrombophilia (heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, antiphospholipid syndrome, heterozygous prothrombin mutation and homozygous MTHFR), multiple gestation and prior pregnancy with preeclampsia. The incidence of preeclampsia is higher in nulliparous than multiparous women. In many countries pre-eclampsia is still most frequent cause of maternal perinatal mortality. HELLP-Syndrome (haemolysis-elevated liver enzyme- low platelets) is a severe progressive course of this disease. Eclampsia, characterized by generalized tonic-clonic convulsion, is the most dangerous complication of pre-eclampsia, and may develop before or after delivery. This form of pre-eclampsia is associated with higher maternal and fetal mortality. Constant maternal hypertension potentially alter vascular integrity of the placenta with further consequences in fetal blood supply leading to growth restriction or zero growth and subsequently resulting in low birth weight or fetal death. The sooner the disease is detected and confirmed, the better the maternal and fetal prognoses are. This is the reason why it is major importance, together with the employment of preventive measures, to identify patients with risk factors with pre-eclampsia though an adequate screening method, thereby detecting the disease earlier and ensuring better pregnancy outcomes for both mother and child.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a common, pregnancy-induced, multisystem disease leading to severe complications in the mother and foetus. The aetiology of pre-eclampsia remains a mystery, but a growing body of evidence suggests that a mitochondrial defect might cause the impairement of differentiation and invasion of the trophoblast that leads to this disorder. This hypothesis is the topic of ongoing studies that, if confirmed, would be highly relevant to preventative strategies for this disease.",preeclampsia
"Despite much research, and clear improvement in our understanding of risk factors and pathogenetic mechanisms, the exact etiology of pre-eclampsia remains unknown. The immune maladaptation hypothesis has been challenged recently by several large epidemiological studies. One of the explanations for contradictory findings might be that the type of pre-eclampsia seen by obstetricians in developed countries mostly involves 30 and more years old, mildly obese pregnant women having near-term pre-eclampsia. It could be that this type of pre-eclampsia is primarily related to pre-existing maternal constitutional factors. This type of pre-eclampsia might be the dominant type of pre-eclampsia in the large Scandinavian and USA studies. In contrast, the epidemiology of pre-eclampsia in young women (age 15-25), so commonly seen in developing countries and certain lower socio-economic groups in developed countries, appears more in line with the immune maladaptation hypothesis. The aim here is to provide an updated review on studies supporting or challenging the immune maladaptation hypothesis.",preeclampsia
"Complications of pregnancy, particularly pre-eclampsia (PET) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) have been associated with future maternal cardiovascular disease (CVD). Pre-eclampsia, characterised by insulin resistance, widespread endothelial damage and dysfunction, coagulation defects and increased systemic inflammatory response, shares many risk factors with CVD. This review describes the pathology of PET and the maternal metabolic response and discusses the possible underlying mechanisms common to CVD and PET. The contributions of pre-existing risk factors and of the exaggerated atherogenic-like response seen in PET persisting post-partum to future CVD are considered. The potential for interventions based on early assessment of cardiovascular risk is addressed. We conclude that despite the low immediate cardiovascular risk in a population of young women, a pregnancy with multiple complications including PET, premature delivery and IUGR, carries a seven-fold additive risk of future disease. These women may be an appropriate cohort for CVD risk screening and for possible intervention.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia, or pregnancy-induced hypertension, is a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality complicating 7-10% of pregnancies. Although mechanisms underlying pre-eclampsia are not well understood, endothelial dysfunction is considered to underscore many of the pre-eclamptic manifestations including hypertension, proteinuria and edema. Leptin, the obese gene product from adipocytes, is produced by the placenta during pregnancy. Serum leptin levels are elevated under normal pregnancy especially during the second trimester, which rapidly decreases and returns to normal after delivery, indicating the role of leptin as a gestational hormone for energy balance. Recent studies have revealed that the placental production of leptin may be pathologically augmented under pre-eclampsia although conflicting data also have been reported. Nevertheless, hyperleptinemia and possible further augmentation under pre-eclampsia may predispose to the development of maternal leptin resistance, which may be a component of insulin resistance predisposing the onset of endothelial dysfunction. This review summarizes recent findings regarding the putative changes of serum leptin levels during pre-eclampsia and the potential consequences on the vascular system.",preeclampsia
"Severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are conditions which are rarely seen in A & E departments today. Although the percentage of patients suffering from these conditions is extremely small, the author has been involved in the care and treatment of two patients with this severe complication of pregnancy. A lack of clear guidelines on this subject was the motivation which prompted further study. This paper covers definitions of pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, history, incidence, risks and pathophysiology. The main discussion is the nursing care and treatment of the eclamptic patient in the acute phase of the condition. The author hopes that by the end of this paper it is evident that all health care professionals should be aware of this dangerous condition and know the appropriate treatment to give to ensure the best quality of care possible.",preeclampsia
"Women with a second and recurrent pre-eclampsia pregnancy have more adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with women with pre-eclampsia in the first pregnancy. A retrospective cohort study was performed to compare the clinical characteristics and perinatal outcomes of pre-eclampsia in parous women who had complicated pre-eclampsia in previous pregnancies (n = 69) and uncomplicated pre-eclampsia in previous pregnancies (n = 312) from 2006 to 2010, in the Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital. No statistical significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of: maternal age, admission blood pressure and BMI; prenatal care times, hospitalisation time, laboratory results and incident rates of complications. The incident and delivery weeks were earlier and the renal injury, caesarean section and small for gestational age (SGA) incidence rates were higher in recurrent pre-eclampsia women. Women with recurrent pre-eclampsia had adverse perinatal outcomes when compared with parous women with pre-eclampsia who had not had pre-eclampsia in prior pregnancies.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a complex familial disorder which probably involves multiple genes in several biological pathways. Case reports, twin studies, segregation analyses, linkage analyses, and association studies have been reported, but thus far, progress has been limited. Most genetic studies have focused on only a handful of candidate genes, and almost all are insufficiently powered to dramatically advance our understanding. Genome-wide association studies are the future of pre-eclampsia genetic research. Multi-center efforts are needed to recruit and define clinical and pathologic subsets, and high-dimensional biology techniques will need to be employed or future efforts will continue to be stymied by pre-eclampsia's heterogeneity. Despite the difficulties detailed in this review, genomic approaches still offer the best opportunity to develop predictive tests and appropriately targeted therapies in the shortest possible time.",preeclampsia
"Hypertension in pregnancy includes a group of distinct disorders that require special consideration in both prevention and pharmacologic treatment. In recent years, there have been few advances regarding the pathophysiology and prevention of preeclampsia, or in recommendations for first-line drug therapy of the hypertensive complications of preeclampsia. Similarly, the recommendations for pharmacologic treatment of women with chronic hypertension antedating pregnancy have changed little, primarily because first-line medications have the advantage of having been the subjects of extensive research experience. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of various second-line drugs for treating hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; whether these therapies can eventually replace the standard recommended medications will require more extensive long-term investigation.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Magnesium sulphate is recommended by international guidelines to prevent eclampsia among women with pre-eclampsia, especially when it is severe, but fewer than 70% of such women receive magnesium sulphate. We aimed to identify variables that prompt Canadian physicians to administer magnesium sulphate to women with pre-eclampsia. Methods: Data were used from the Canadian Perinatal Network (2005-11) of women hospitalized at <29 weeks' who were thought to be at high risk of delivery due to pre-eclampsia (using broad Canadian definition). Unadjusted analyses of relative risks were estimated directly and population attributable risk percent (PAR%) calculated to identify variables associated with magnesium sulphate use. A multivariable model was created and a generalized estimating equation was used to estimate the adjusted RR that explained magnesium sulphate use in pre-eclampsia. The adjusted PAR% was estimated by bootstrapping. Results: Of 631 women with pre-eclampsia, 174 (30.1%) had severe pre-eclampsia, of whom 131 (75.3%) received magnesium sulphate. 457 (69.9%) women had non-severe pre-eclamspia, of whom 291 (63.7%) received magnesium sulphate. Use of magnesium sulphate among women with pre-eclampsia could be attributed to the following clinical factors (PAR%): delivery for 'adverse conditions' (48.7%), severe hypertension (21.9%), receipt of antenatal corticosteroids (20.0%), maternal transport prior to delivery (9.9%), heavy proteinuria (7.8%), and interventionist care (3.4%). Conclusions: Clinicians are more likely to administer magnesium sulphate for eclampsia prophylaxis in the presence of more severe maternal clinical features, in addition to concomitant antenatal corticosteroid administration, and shorter admission to delivery periods related to transport from another institution or plans for interventionist care.",preeclampsia
"Background: Redman and Jefferies have proposed a revised definition of pre-eclampsia which is based on absolute blood pressure levels and an increment from the baseline in the first half of pregnancy. There is no requirement for proteinuria. This definition should facilitate the distinction between nonproteinuric pre-eclampsia and other causes of nonproteinuric gestational hypertension, such as chronic essential hypertension. Objectives: 1. To determine whether the blood pressure criteria of Redman and Jefferies can select women with characteristics of pre-eclampsia from the group of women with gestational hypertension by the current criteria of the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP). 2. To determine the level of agreement between the classification system proposed by Redman and Jefferies and that of the ISSHP. Design: A prospective study. Setting: Obstetric unit, Dudley Road Hospital, Birmingham, UK. Subjects: Six hundred and ninety-two healthy nulliparous women and 11 women with chronic hypertension antedating pregnancy. Main outcome measures: 1. Differences in maternal characteristics and obstetric outcome among women with gestational (nonproteinuric) hypertension by the ISSHP criteria, meeting (and failing to meet) the Redman and Jefferies' blood pressure criteria. 2. The proportion of women classified as normal, proteinuric pre-eclampsia, and chronic hypertension on the basis of both Redman and Jefferies' criteria and the current ISSHP criteria. Results: There were 55 women with gestational hypertension alone by the ISSHP criteria, of whom 33 met Redman and Jefferies' blood pressure criteria for pre-eclampsia. This group of 33 women had characteristics of nonproteinuric pre-eclampsia, compared with the remaining 22 women in the ISSHP gestational hypertension category who had characteristics of chronic hypertension. The group of 33 were significantly younger and less obese, had significantly lower blood pressure at their first antenatal visit and their obstetric outcome was poorer. The Redman and Jefferies' blood pressure criteria identified as normal 99.5% (95% CI, 98.6% to 99.9%) of women who were also characterised as normal on the basis of the ISSHP criteria (622/625). There were 12 women with proteinuric pre-eclampsia by the ISSHP criteria of whom 11 (92%; 95% CI, 62% to 99.8%) met Redman and Jefferies' blood pressure criteria for pre-eclampsia. None of the 11 women with chronic hypertension antedating pregnancy met these criteria. Conclusions: In this population the blood pressure criteria for pre-eclampsia proposed by Redman and Jefferies select women with features of pre-eclampsia (i.e., proteinuria and relatively poor outcome) and, in particular, they enable a distinction to be made between nonproteinuric pre-eclampsia and other causes of gestational hypertension.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia (PE), a characteristic hypertensive disorder of human pregnancy and a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide, shares some similarities with atherosclerosis, namely the involvement of oxidative stress and of endothelial dysfunction in their pathophysiologies, the presence of similar typical lesions and of common risk factors. Although it is widely accepted that regular physical exercise protects against cardiovascular events, few studies have addressed the impact of physical activity in reducing PE risk. In this paper, similarities between atherosclerosis and PE, involving pathogenic mechanisms, are described. This paper also reviews the studies performed until now that evaluated the impact of regular physical exercise (prenataly or during pregnancy) in reducing risk of PE. The potential mechanisms underlying physical activity as a prophylactic approach of PE, as observed with cardiovascular diseases, are discussed.",preeclampsia
"The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy remain a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality in Europe and North America. Pre-eclampsia, which is proteinuric gestational hypertension, accounts for the majority of the excess risks and is defined by the maternal syndrome. The maternal syndrome of pre-eclampsia is characterised by a systemic inflammatory response and its sequelae. Systematic multisystem evaluation of pre-eclampsia, evidence-based antihypertensive therapy, and the use of MgSO4 to prevent and treat the seizures of eclampsia can reduce maternal risks. For mild-to-moderate pregnancy hypertension, maternal risks are small, and there may be adverse perinatal consequences of blood pressure normalisation. Early-onset and severe pre-eclampsia predict an excess risk of later cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Both Chlamydophila pneumoniae and cytomegalovirus have bee associated with pre-eclampsia and atherosclerosis, and may provide a mechanistic link between pre-eclampsia and the recognised cardiovascular risk. Women with a history of either early-onset and/or severe pre-eclampsia should be considered to be at increased risk for later cardiovascular disease, and it may be prudent for them to have regular lipid profiles and tests for urinary microalbumin excretion.",preeclampsia
"Based on a review of the literature, hemodynamic signs and measurements in severe preeclampsia are described. Advantages and disadvantages of various hemodynamic methods and resulting indications for therapy are discussed. We found that in respect of hemodynamic monitoring in severe preeclampsia there are no indications for central venous pressure and conclude that at present there is no alternative to right heart catheterization (Swan-Ganz catheter).",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia and placental abruption may share a common pathophysiologic mechanism, namely, uteroplacental ischaemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between placental abruption and risk of pre-eclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy, and to determine whether the association differs by the gestational age at the time of abruption. Methods: A nested case-control study among multiparous women in the Medical Birth Register of Finland from 1996-2010 was conducted. Cases of pre-eclampsia (n = 6487) and frequency matched controls (n = 25,948) were linked to the Hospital Discharge Registry to ascertain data on prior abruption. Abruption was categorised as preterm (<37 weeks) or term (≥37 weeks) based on the gestational age at delivery. We fit logistic regression models to evaluate the associations between abruption and the odds of pre-eclampsia in the subsequent pregnancy before and after adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Preterm abruption was associated with over a twofold increase in risk of pre-eclampsia [odds ratio (OR) 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5, 3.3] in a subsequent pregnancy. In contrast, term abruption was not associated with pre-eclampsia (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.7, 1.7). The association between preterm abruption and pre-eclampsia was further elevated among women with a history of pre-eclampsia. Associations with preterm abruption were also strengthened when the outcome was pre-eclampsia with early delivery (<34 weeks). Conclusions: These findings suggest that placental abruption in a prior pregnancy is associated with a different risk profile of pre-eclampsia based on the gestational age of the abruption-affected pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal mortality in Africa; and has been associated with the interplay of genetic, metabolic and environmental factors. Polymorphisms of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase (MTR) folate cycle genes, have been controversially associated with pre-eclampsia in studies from different human populations. Objectives: To determine the distribution of MTHFR C677T and MTR A2756G polymorphisms in a Nigerian population and evaluate possible associations with the occurrence of pre-eclampsia and homocysteine metabolic derangement. Materials and methods: This study was a hospital based study carried out in Lagos, South-western Nigeria. Two hundred pregnant women clinically diagnosed with pre-eclampsia (study group) and 200 apparently healthy non-pre-eclamptic pregnant women (control group) were recruited for the study after written informed consent. Pre-eclampsia was diagnosed based on the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy re-classification of 2013. MTHFR C677T and MTR A2756G polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Statistical analyzes were performed using SPSS version 23. Hardy-Weinberg distribution were tested with χ2 test. Logistic regression model was used to evaluate the relationship of variables with pre-eclampsia. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: MTHFR genotype frequencies of CC, CT and TT were 59.8%; 31.2% and 9.0% in study group and 76.6%; 22.3% and 1.0% in the control group respectively. MTR A2756G genotype frequencies of AA, AG and GG genotypes were 71.9%; 20.1% and 8.0% for the study group and 81.5%; 16.4% and 2.1% for the control group. Occurrence of pre-eclampsia was significantly associated with presence of T allele of MTHFR (OR = 1.855; p < 0.05) and G allele of MTR genes (OR = 1.269; p < 0.05), Homozygosity of TG haplotype significantly increased the occurrence of pre-eclampsia among Nigerian women (OR = 2.252; p < 0.05). Population attributable risk fraction percent for the T and G alleles were 16.4% and 11.5% respectively. Mean plasma Hcy level was not, however, significantly affected by MTHFR/MTR haplotypes (F = 1.54; p = 0.157). Conclusion: MTHFR C677T and MTR A2756G polymorphisms were associated with pre-eclampsia in a population of pregnant women in Lagos, Nigeria.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is still one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Despite active research for many decades, the etiology of this disorder exclusive to human pregnancy is an enigma. Recent evidence suggests there may be several underlying causes or predispositions leading to endothelial dysfunction and causing the signs of hypertension, proteinuria, and edema--findings that allow us to make the diagnosis of the ""syndrome"" of pre-eclampsia. It is obvious that a single mechanism responsible for the syndrome pre-eclampsia does not exist. Instead, several mechanisms can act together and even multiply each other. The search for the underlying cause of this disorder and for a clinical marker to predict which women will develop pre-eclampsia is ongoing, with its prevention being the ultimate goal.",preeclampsia
"A total population of pregnant women from Aberdeen City District 1967-1978 has been studied. There were 29 851 pregnancies and 6637 women had a first recorded pregnancy between 1967 and 1978 and had two or more pregnancy events. As expected the incidence of pre-eclampsia in a second pregnancy was less than that in a first pregnancy, but it was dependent on the outcome of the first pregnancy. If the first pregnancy was complicated by proteinuric pre-eclampsia than the incidence of the condition in the second pregnancy was similar to that in a first pregnancy, but women who were normotensive in the first pregnancy had a reduced incidence of the condition in the second pregnancy. The incidence of proteinuric pre-eclampsia after early abortion (less than 13 weeks), either spontaneous or induced was similar to the population incidence in a first pregnancy, but after a late spontaneous abortion the risk of proteinuric pre-eclampsia was significantly reduced. Change of civil status of the offspring from first to second pregnancy did not affect the incidence of pre-eclampsia in a second pregnancy. There was an effect of birthweight in that women who had proteinuric pre-eclampsia in conjunction with a low-birthweight baby (less than 2500 g) in their first pregnancy had double the incidence of proteinuric pre-eclampsia in their second pregnancy. Only a pregnancy of 37 weeks or more is likely to offer protection or 'immunity' to pre-eclampsia in a second pregnancy and even then the effect is moderated by the development of pre-eclampsia in the first pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"The primary feature of pre-eclampsia is the pregnancy-associated rise in arterial pressure. Oedema and proteinuria also frequently occur. There is increased responsiveness to pressor agents. Prolactin is present in elevated amounts in human pregnancy and is found in very large quantities in amniotic fluid. Prolactin can cause renal retention of fluid and electrolytes, can elevate arterial pressure and can protentiate responses to pressor agents. It is suggested that either elevated prolactin levels or an increased responsiveness to normal prolactin levels may play a key role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia

"Background: Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a platelet-derived vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation. These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, and low dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay the development of pre-eclampsia. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents when given to women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and to those with established pre-eclampsia. Search strategy: This review drew on the search strategy developed for the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group as a whole. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was also searched, The Cochrane Library 1999 Issue 1, Embase was searched from 1994-1999 and hand searches were performed of the congress proceedings of the International and European Societies for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy. Selection criteria: All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent during pregnancy. Quasi random study designs were excluded. Participants were pregnant women considered to be at risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and those with pre-eclampsia before delivery. Women treated postpartum were excluded. Interventions were any comparisons of an antiplatelet agent (such as low dose aspirin or dipyridamole) with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent. Data collection and analysis: Assessment of trials for inclusion in the review and extraction of data was performed independently and unblinded by two reviewers. Data were entered into the Review Manager software and double checked. Main results: Forty two trials involving over 32,000 women were included in this review, with 30,563 women in the prevention trials. There is a 15% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents [32 trials with 29,331 women; relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (0.78, 0.92); Number needed to treat (NNT) 89, (59, 167)]. This reduction is regardless of risk status at trial entry or whether a placebo was used, and irrespective of the dose of aspirin or gestation at randomisation.Twenty three trials (28,268 women) reported preterm delivery. There is a small (8%) reduction in the risk of delivery before 37 completed weeks [RR 0.92, (0.88, 0.97); NNT 72 (44, 200)]. Baby deaths were reported in 30 trials (30,093 women). Overall there is a 14% reduction in baby deaths in the antiplatelet group [RR 0.86, (0.75, 0.98); NNT 250 (125, >10000)]. Small for gestational age babies were reported in 25 trials (20,349 women), with no overall difference between the groups, RR 0.92, (0.84, 1.01). There were no significant differences between treatment and control groups in any other measures of outcome. Five trials compared antiplatelet agents with placebo or no antiplatelet agent for the treatment of pre-eclampsia. There are insufficient data for any firm conclusions about the possible effects of these agents when used for treatment of pre-eclampsia. Authors' conclusions: Antiplatelet agents, in this review largely low dose aspirin, have small-moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia. Further information is required to assess which women are most likely to benefit, when treatment should be started, and at what dose.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Preterm and term pre-eclampsia may differ in etiology. This could be reflected in differences in placenta weight. Therefore, we compared placenta weight in pregnancies with preterm or term pre-eclampsia to placenta weight in pregnancies without pre-eclampsia. Design: Population study. Setting: Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Population: All singleton pregnancies in Norway from 1999 through 2004 delivered at or after 21 weeks' gestation (n=317,688). Methods: Placenta weight in pregnancies without pre-eclampsia (n=304,875) was compared to placenta weight in pregnancies with preterm pre-eclampsia (delivery before week 37 of pregnancy, n=3,070) and term pre-eclampsia (delivery on or after week 37 of pregnancy, n=9,743). Placenta weight z-scores were calculated to adjust for offspring sex and length of gestation, and grouped in tenths. Placenta weight according to pre-eclampsia status is presented as proportions within each tenth. Main outcome measures: Pre-eclampsia status. Results: In preterm pre-eclampsia, placentas were over-represented in the two lowest (33.8%; 95% CI 32.1-35.5) and under-represented in the two highest (13.1%; 95% CI 11.9-14.3) tenths of placenta weight compared to pregnancies without pre-eclampsia (20%). In term pre-eclampsia, placentas were over-represented in the two lowest (22.0%; 95% CI 21.2-22.8) and the two highest (22.7%; 95% CI 21.9-23.6) placenta weight groups. Mean placenta weight z-score was higher in term pre-eclampsia compared to pregnancies without pre-eclampsia. Conclusions: Small placentas were associated with pre-eclampsia, and more strongly with preterm than term pre-eclampsia. In term pre-eclampsia, the association with placenta weight was u-shaped, yielding higher proportions of both low and high placenta weight compared to pregnancies without pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Different measures of raised blood pressure were analysed in 16,211 singleton pregnancies to determine the most effective way of identifying pre-eclampsia. Increments from baseline in the first half of pregnancy were considered as well as absolute levels. A combination of a high maximum diastolic pressure with a large increase from baseline was better for identifying a group with pre-eclamptic features than either measurement on its own. A first diastolic pressure below 90 mm Hg, a subsequent increase of at least 25 mm Hg, and a maximum reading of at least 90 mm Hg gave appropriate criteria. These were applied to a second set of 15,624 singleton pregnancies and successfully identified a group with pre-eclamptic features. Fewer women were identified as pre-eclamptic than with criteria modified from an existing definition widely used in Britain. The women excluded by the new criteria had the features of mild chronic hypertension rather than pre-eclampsia. The new definition is simple to use but like all other definitions of pre-eclampsia cannot be precise.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: A previous study demonstrated that the increase in diastolic blood pressure during pregnancy was reduced by supplementation with magnesium. The present study was undertaken to explore if increases in diastolic blood pressure could be useful for early identification of pre-eclampsia. Study design: Hospital records of nulliparous, singleton normal pregnancies (n = 100) and those diagnosed with pre-eclampsia (n = 109) were obtained from a register at an antenatal health care unit. Data on blood pressure at the regular visits to the unit were collected and analysed. Results: The systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly higher at pregnancy week 12 among those who developed pre-eclampsia (p = 0.046 and 0.001, resp). An increase in diastolic blood pressure ≥15 mmHg occurred more frequently among women with pre-eclampsia. In 93 % of the cases, this increase was present before and at the same time as the clinical diagnosis of pre-eclampsia was established. Conclusion: The results suggest that a base-line diastolic blood pressure of ≥80 mmHg and an increase in diastolic blood pressure of ≥15 mmHg could be used to identify women at risk of pre-eclampsia (sensitivity 92 %, specificity 44 %) and as a selection criterion in treatment or prevention assays.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: The clinical characteristics of pre-eclampsia (gestational hypertension and proteinuria) may represent separate pathogenetic conditions. Pre-eclampsia accompanied by restricted fetal growth may originate from abnormal implantation, and appropriate or high birthweights may indicate a mixture of conditions, ranging from mild pre-eclampsia with modest placental involvement to hypertensive conditions without placental disease. Design: Prospective, observational study. Setting: General population. Population: We used data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, a population-based registry that has recorded births since 1967. For this study, we used information on length of gestation and presence of pre-eclampsia among 1,679,205 singletons born between 1967 and 1998. Pre-eclampsia was diagnosed in 44,220 (2.6%) pregnancies. Methods: We studied the risk of pre-eclampsia in relation to standardised measures (z scores) of birthweight, adjusted for length of gestation, and stratified by term and preterm delivery. We also explored whether gestational diabetes was more prevalent in conjunction with preterm than term pre-eclampsia. Main outcome measures: Pre-eclampsia diagnosed at term or preterm. Results: For pre-eclampsia diagnosed around term, there was a U-shaped association with birthweight. Compared with appropriate birthweights for gestation, the risk of term pre-eclampsia was more than fourfold higher (relative risk [RR] 4.5, 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3 to 4.7) if the baby's birthweight was lower than two standard deviations under the mean. For birthweights three standard deviations or higher than the mean, pre-eclampsia was more than twice as likely (RR 2.6, 95% CI 2.2-2.9). In contrast, the risk of preterm pre-eclampsia displayed an L-shaped association with birthweight. Low birthweight (less than -2 standard deviations) was associated with greatly increased risk (RR 9.9, 95% CI 9.1-10.9), but for high birthweights (>or=3 standard deviations), there was no association with the risk of preterm pre-eclampsia (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.7-2.1). The prevalence of gestational diabetes was three times (prevalence ratio 3.3, 95% CI 2.6-3.6) higher in preterm than term pre-eclampsia. Conclusion: Whereas pre-eclampsia with preterm delivery associated with low birthweight may be caused by underlying placental abnormality, pre-eclampsia delivered at term may represent a mixture of conditions, ranging from mild pre-eclampsia with moderate placental affection to hypertensive conditions in pregnancy without placental dysfunction.",preeclampsia
"Arterial hypertension is a relatively common complication of pregnancy, affecting about 10% of all normal pregnancies. The American College of Obstetric and Gynecology established in 1972 four different forms of arterial hypertension during pregnancy: a) arterial hypertension related to pregnancy, the so-called pre-eclampsia; b) arterial hypertension unrelated to pregnancy or chronic arterial hypertension; c) Pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic arterial hypertension, and d) Transient or late arterial hypertension (third trimester). Pre-eclampsia and arterial hypertension are two different illnesses with different approaches and treatments. The mechanisms involved in arterial hypertension and pre-eclampsia of pregnant women are presently very well known, including genetic causes, alterations on the renin-angiotensin system, imbalance between vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents derived from endothelial activity of the spiral arteries of the placenta, such as; prostacyclins, thromboxane A2, nitric oxide, endothelin-1, etc. The placenta is the key factor in inducing pre-eclampsia, and its expulsion during delivery or cesarean section is the definite cure of the process. All hypertensive forms during pregnancy increase the risks on both the mother and the fetus. Maternal risk is based on renal, metabolic and haematologic disorders, leading in some cases to cerebral haemorrhage or hepatic rupture. In the fetus, pre-eclampsia significantly increases the risk of still-birth, abruptio placentae, hypocalvaria, intrauterine growth retardation, and prematurity. Clinical, biochemical and haematologic manifestations of pre-eclampsia are very typical, facilitating an early and easy diagnosis.",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia is a major contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Our objectives in this study are to economically assess, from the payer perspective, routine screening for pre-eclampsia using placental markers -placental protein 13 and placental growth factor - and uterine artery Doppler compared with standard care. Methods: A decision model was developed, which progresses through three sequential endpoints, and compares screening with no screening: (1) Pre-eclampsia yes/no: calculation of the incremental cost of pre-eclampsia-case averted; (2) Hospital discharge: calculation of the mean accumulated costs until discharge after delivery; and (3) Offspring death: calculation of the incremental cost per quality of life-adjusted life-year gained by screening. Data used includes: (1) Obstetrical data of 14 500 births; (2) cost data from the Israeli Ministry of Health and the literature; and (3) screening performance and outcome from the literature. Results: (1) The incremental cost of pre-eclampsia-case averted is $66,949 and $24,723 when the prevalence is 1.7 and 5% respectively. (2) With test cost of $112, the total cost until discharge with/without screening is equal. With pre-eclampsia prevalence of 3%, screening is cheaper. (3) The cost per quality of life-adjusted life-year with screening is $18,919 and < $10,000 with pre-eclampsia prevalence of 1.7 and 3%, respectively. Conclusions: Screening for pre-eclampsia is cost-effective under various scenarios.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To compare disease features in women with pre-eclampsia between those who are correctly identified (true positive) and those who are missed (false negative) when applying first-trimester prediction algorithms for pre-eclampsia to a prospectively enrolled population. Method: Six first-trimester early (requiring delivery < 34 weeks' gestation) pre-eclampsia algorithms were applied to a prospective cohort of singleton pregnancies enrolled at first-trimester screening. Maternal outcomes, neonatal outcomes and severity parameters for pre-eclampsia were compared between true-positive and false-negative predictions. Results: Twenty of 2446 (0.8%) women developed early pre-eclampsia, with 65% of these developing severe features and 20% HELLP syndrome. At enrollment, true-positive cases were more likely to be African-American and chronically hypertensive, while false-negative cases were more likely to be Caucasian. At delivery, true-positive cases were more likely to have pre-eclampsia superimposed on hypertension, severely elevated blood pressure and creatinine level > 1.1 mg/dL. False-negative cases were more likely to have HELLP syndrome (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: In an urban population with a high prevalence of chronic hypertension, patients who are correctly identified by first-trimester screening models are more likely to develop pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension with severely elevated blood pressure and evidence of renal failure. In contrast, patients who are missed by these algorithms are more likely to have HELLP syndrome. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and the algorithm adjustments that may be necessary to better predict pre-eclampsia phenotypes.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a disease which causes significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, especially in the developing countries. Despite numerous studies, the etiology of pre-eclampsia has not yet been fully elucidated. Although several evidences indicate that various elements such as serum Magnesium, Calcium etc. might play an important role in pre-eclampsia. The present study prospectively determines and evaluate whether maternal serum levels of magnesium has any association with pre-eclampsia or not. It was a cross sectional study carried out in the Department of Biochemistry, Mymensingh Medical College from July 2009 to June 2010. A total of 108 subjects were selected with the duration of pregnancy from 28th week of gestation to term of which 42 were normal pregnant women (as control) and 66 were pre-eclamptic (34 with mild and 32 with severe preeclampsia) admitted in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology department of Mymensingh medical college hospital. Serum Magnesium level was determined in the laboratory by colorimetric method using recommended commercial kit. Student's unpaired t-test was used to see the statistical significance of the difference between the mean values of the estimated parameters. The mean serum levels of Magnesium in normal pregnant group was 1.91±0.08mg/dl, mild pre-eclamptic group was 1.8±0.11mg/dl,and in severe pre-eclamptic group was 1.75±0.10mg/dl. The mean serum Magnesium of women with mild pre-eclampsia as well as severe pre-eclampsia was significantly (p<0.001) decreased in comparison to that of the control. A significant (p<0.05) decrease in serum magnesium was also found in subject with severe pre-eclamptic compared to that of the mild pre-eclamptic. So, these results indicate that reduction in serum levels of magnesium during pregnancy might be a possible contributor in the etiology of pre-eclampsia and supplementation of this element as diet or drugs may be of value to prevent pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia

"Until now, there is no systematic information on the role of endothelial dysfunction in the mechanisms of disorders of blood coagulation potential and microcirculation in different organs and tissues in preeclampsia. Objective: Our aim was to extend the existing principles of diagnosis of pre-eclampsia by establishing the role of endothelial dysfunction in the mechanisms of blood coagulation potential violations. Methods: A prospective comparative study was performed. Condition of coagulation processes studied by conventional techniques, parameters of a functional endothelium (nitric oxide metabolites, endothelin 1, thrombospondin, thrombomodulin and intercellular adhesion molecules in blood plasma)--by ELISA. Results: The study group included 55 patients with moderate preeclampsia and 49 pregnant women with severe pre-eclampsia, in the control group--40 women with physiological pregnancy. In patients with pre-eclampsia moderate observed increase in plasma endothelin-1 (p < 0.001), thrombospondin (p < 0.001), intercellular adhesion molecules (p < 0.001) while reducing the level of nitrogen oxide (p < 0.001), increase in time of fibrinolysis (p < 0.050) and decreased international normalized ratio (p < 0.050) compared with the control group. With increasing severity of preeclampsia the researchers detected in blood plasma of patients a progressive increase in endothelin 1 (p1 < 0.020), thrombospondin (p1 < 0.001), intercellular adhesion molecules (p1 < 0.001) and decrease of nitric oxide metabolites (p1 < 0.001) and thrombomodulin (p1 < 0.001); the last combined with the activation of procoagulant hemostasis. Conclusion: There is a pathogenetic relationship between the development of endothelial dysfunction, impaired blood coagulation potential and the severity of clinical signs ofpreeclampsia. To widen the number of existing techniques to diagnose the severity of pre-eclampsia we recommende to mesure endothelin 1, thrombomodulin, thrombospondin, intercellular adhesion molecules and nitric oxide metabolites in the blood plasma, and use traditional indicators to assess the hemostatic system.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia/eclampsia, also known as toxemia of pregnancy, remains one of the great triad of obstetric complications. The outlook for the preeclamptic woman and the fetus has improved as a result of increased knowledge of uteroplacental-fetal physiology and of the physiologic deviations involved in preeclampsia, although the basic cause of preeclampsia remains unknown. Careful screening of women at risk for preeclampsia along with early detection and treatment can help reduce the toll taken in stillbirths, prematurity, and maternal death. Current concepts of pathophysiology are reviewed as is nursing care during the antepartum and intrapartum periods.",preeclampsia
"Severe pre-eclampsia is a complex disease, which taxes the expertise of even the most experienced obstetric anesthesiologist. The treatment should focus on stabilization of blood pressure, optimization of fluid status, and prevention of convulsions. Neuraxial blocks for labor and delivery offer many benefits to the mother and her infant. For cesarean section, there is unequivocal evidence of superiority of neuraxial anesthesia over general anesthesia. If general anesthesia is needed, careful preanesthetic preparation and meticulous airway management is essential. The successful and safe peripartum management of the pre-eclamptic patient and her infant is a team effort among the anesthesiologist, obstetrician, and neonatologist.",preeclampsia
"The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between hypertensive retinopathy and the severity of pre-eclampsia. Forty women with pre-eclampsia, mean age 29.1 (+/- 7.4; range, 19-44) years, were retrospectively analyzed. They were treated at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Clinical Hospital Split, from January 1997 to December 1999. The mean age of gestation was 36.0 +/- 2.8 weeks (range, 28-39). Pre-eclampsia was classified according to Goecke. Based on the ophthalmoscopic fundus examinations the patients were divided into four groups, according to Keith-Wagner classification system of grading retinal changes. Of 40 analyzed women, 18 (45%) had ophthalmologically verified hypertensive retinopathy. Ten of them were classified as grade I, six as grade II and two as grade III. Twenty-two patients had mild pre-eclampsia, ten patients had moderate pre-eclampsia, and eight patients had severe pre-eclampsia. A statistically significant correlation (t-test) was found between the degree of hypertensive retinopathy and patient age, Apgar score, trophism, Goecke's index, proteinuria, systolic and diastolic pressure (P < 0.001) and edema (P = 0.01). The degree of hypertensive retinopathy was directly proportional with the severity of pre-eclampsia and significant correlation was found between them (r = 0.338, p = 0.033). These findings showed that the degree of hypertensive retinopathy in women with pre-eclampsia is a valid and reliable prognostic factor in determining the severity of the pre-eclampsia. Therefore, it can be concluded that the examination of the fundus is a valuable and necessary diagnostic procedure in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"When the HLA types of 80 pre-eclamptic women and their husbands and 83 control couples were compared significantly more pre-eclamptic women had only one identifiable HLA B antigen, and were presumed to be homozygous at this locus. Those who were homozygous for HLA B were more likely to be homozygous for HLA A as well, and more likely to be homozygous for HLA A as well, and to have more severe pre-eclampsia. There was neither increased HLA incompatibility nor greater antigen-sharing between pre-eclamptic women and their husbands, but maternal HLA A and B homozygosity reduced the number of antigenic disparities between pre-eclamptic women and their husbands. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that maternal recessive immune-response genes may contribute to the development of pre-eclampsia. Alternatively maternal HLA homozygosity may predispose to fetal changes comparable to runting.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia as a serious syndrome affecting both the mother and the baby is associated with a number of socio-economic, demographic and clinical characteristics. We have filed the distribution of major epidemiological parameters in two gypsy groups, comprising 58 preeclamptic and 118 control cases. Only the classical features of preeclampsia as well as single liveborns were included in our study. Data are taken from the medical files and from a direct interview with the patients. Nonparametric and multivariate analysis are applied. The two study groups show insignificant differences in the distribution of the major epidemiological factors. Significant p-values are obtained referring to maternal age, parity, obesity. Speculations as to gypsy lifestyle are discussed as possible explanation to the achieved results.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To determine whether the incidence of pre-eclampsia is different in dichorionic compared to monochorionic twin pregnancies. Methods: The study involved 666 twin pregnancies resulting in two live births after 24 weeks of gestation. Ultrasound examination at 10-14 weeks of gestation demonstrated that 171 (25.7%) were monochorionic and 495 (74.3%) were dichorionic twins. Pregnancy outcome information regarding the development of pre-eclampsia was obtained from the maternity units. The incidence of pre-eclampsia in the dichorionic and monochorionic twin pregnancies was compared. Results: The incidence of pre-eclampsia in monochorionic twin pregnancies (9.4%) was not significantly different from that in dichorionic pregnancies (7.3%) ( P = 0.48). Multiple logistic regression revealed that chorionicity has no effect on the development of pre-eclampsia after adjusting for maternal age, ethnic group, maternal smoking, parity and gestational age at delivery ( P = 0.6; odds ratio for monochorionic compared with dichorionic twin pregnancies, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-2.3). Conclusion: In twin pregnancies chorionicity does not affect the incidence of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: a new first-trimester universal antenatal screening test for pre-eclampsia was introduced into two UK hospitals. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential psychological benefits, harms and acceptability of providing pregnant women with formal risk information for pre-eclampsia. Design: cross-sectional interview study. Women were interviewed using a theoretically informed semi-structured schedule and transcripts were analysed thematically using Framework Analysis. Setting and participants: primigravid women receiving antenatal care at a central London National Health Service Foundation Trust found either high-risk or low-risk for pre-eclampsia. Findings: 15 primigravid women who received high risk (n=10) or low risk (n=5) results of a 12-week pre-eclampsia screening test were interviewed. Two types of coping typologies were evident from the data. The first were 'danger managers' who had an internal sense of control, were focused on the risk that pre-eclampsia presented to them and exhibited information seeking, positive behaviour changes, and cognitive reappraisal coping mechanisms. The second were 'fear managers' who had an external sense of control, were focused on the risk that pre-eclampsia presented to the fetus, and exhibited avoidance coping mechanisms. In addition to these typologies, three universal themes of 'medicalising the pregnancy', 'embracing technology' and 'acceptability' emerged from the data. Key conclusions: there are potential positive and negative unintended consequences following a first-trimester screening test for pre-eclampsia. A positive consequence could be self-instigated behaviour change, whereas a negative consequence could be reduced self-monitoring of fetal movements as the pregnancy develops. Implications for practice: this study indicates that women with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia would be willing to engage in efforts to reduce their risk of pre-eclampsia, and there is a potential to use this screening test as a basis for improving health more broadly.",preeclampsia
"The origin of pre-eclampsia lies in uteroplacental ischemia due to an anomaly of the ""vascular insertion"" of the placenta. Although the cause of this anomaly remains unknown, it would appear to include both a genetic and an immunological origin possibly favourised by special underlying conditions and certain obstetric circumstances. Prostaglandin imbalance (in particular prostacyclins and Thromboxane A2) appears to be one of the chief factors governing these anomalies. One of the consequences of these mechanisms is the onset of hypertension but other disturbances are essential features. In particular, disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur leading to the release of numerous microthrombi which cause placental (leading to chronic fetal distress), renal, hepatic and cerebral lesions.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To assess the relation between serum leptin levels and lipid profile in women with pre-eclampsia and to evaluate their atherogenic role in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. Methods: This was a comparative cross-sectional study, carried out in the Department of Physiology, Basic Medical Sciences Institute, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), in collaboration with the department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, JPMC. For this purpose 45 primigravidas with normal pregnancy and 45 primigravidas with pre-eclamptic pregnancy were selected who were in their third trimester. All the subjects were of the same maternal age, gestational age, height and weight. Serum leptin levels were determined by immunoenzymometric assay and total lipid profile was determined by enzymatic colorimetric method. Results: The study included 90 patients, divided into two groups of whom 45 were diagnosed as pre-eclampsia and 45 were controls. All the variables of the lipid profile of pre-eclamptic patients, were found to be significantly elevated as compared to controls. The total lipid profile was also compared to the severity of pre-eclampsia and total cholestrol was found to be significantly raised (p < 0.01) in severe pre-eclampsia when compared to mild. On correlating serum leptin with lipid profile, again total cholestrol was found to be significantly high (p < 0.05) in pre-eclamptic group compared to controls. Conclusion: This study concluded that serum leptin levels during pre-eclampsia are strongly associated with total cholesterol whereas association with other variables is insignificant. With severity of pre-eclampsia when leptin level rises, total cholesterol also rises. These changes may be the result of oxidative stress and may contribute to atherogenesis and pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia is associated with deficient intravascular production of prostacyclin, a vasodilator, and excessive production of thromboxane, a platelet-derived vasoconstrictor and stimulant of platelet aggregation. These observations led to the hypotheses that antiplatelet agents, and low dose aspirin in particular, might prevent or delay the development of pre-eclampsia. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antiplatelet agents when given to women at risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and to those with established pre-eclampsia. Search strategy: This review drew on the search strategy developed for the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group as a whole. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was also searched, The Cochrane Library 1999 Issue 1, Embase was searched from 1994-1999 and hand searches were performed of the congress proceedings of the International and European Societies for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy. Selection criteria: All randomised trials comparing antiplatelet agents with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent during pregnancy. Quasi random study designs were excluded. Participants were pregnant women considered to be at risk of developing pre-eclampsia, and those with pre-eclampsia before delivery. Women treated postpartum were excluded. Interventions were any comparisons of an antiplatelet agent (such as low dose aspirin or dipyridamole) with either placebo or no antiplatelet agent. Data collection and analysis: Assessment of trials for inclusion in the review and extraction of data was performed independently and unblinded by two reviewers. Data were entered into the Review Manager software and double checked. Main results: Forty two trials involving over 32,000 women were included in this review, with 30,563 women in the prevention trials. There is a 15% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with the use of antiplatelet agents [32 trials with 29,331 women; relative risk (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (0.78, 0.92); Number needed to treat (NNT) 89, (59, 167)]. This reduction is regardless of risk status at trial entry or whether a placebo was used, and irrespective of the dose of asprin or gestation at randomisation. Twenty three trials (28,268 women) reported preterm delivery. There is a small (8%) reduction in the risk of delivery before 37 completed weeks [RR 0.92, (0.88, 0.97); NNT 72 (44, 200)]. Baby deaths were reported in 30 trials (30,093 women). Overall there is a 14% reduction in baby deaths in the antiplatelet group [RR 0.86, (0. 75, 0.98); NNT 250 (125, >10000)]. Small for gestational age babies were reported in 25 trials (20,349 women), with no overall difference between the groups, RR 0.92, (0.84, 1.01). There were no significant differences between treatment and control groups in any other measures of outcome. Five trials compared antiplatelet agents with placebo or no antiplatelet agent for the treatment of pre-eclampsia. There are insufficient data for any firm conclusions about the possible effects of these agents when used for treatment of pre-eclampsia. Reviewer's conclusions: Antiplatelet agents, in this review largely low dose aspirin, have small-moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia. Further information is required to assess which women are most likely to benefit, when treatment should be started, and at what dose.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, along with its complications such as prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal asphyxia and abruptio placenta, continues to be one of the major causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Due to its morbid course, it is necessary to identify those at risk for the illness and take precautions. However, the lack of knowledge about the aetiology makes it difficult to assess risk factors. We studied the role of the serum androgens in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Ninety severe pre-eclamptic, 10 mild pre-eclamptic and 50 normotensive pregnant women were studied. The patient and control groups' blood total testosterone, free oestriol (FE3), FAI (free androgene index), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and dehydroepiandrostenedione sulphate (DHEA-S) values were compared. The sex, weight, APGAR scores and hospitalisation in the neonatal intensive care unit of the babies were also evaluated. No statistically significant difference in the total testosterone and free oestriol values was found between the groups. SHBG was found to be higher in the pre-eclamptic group, whereas free testosterone and DHEA-S were higher in the normotensive group. Compared to the severe pre-eclamptic group, no difference was found in the total testosterone levels, whereas free testosterone levels were significantly higher in the mild pre-eclamptic group. We reached the opinion that androgens do not play a clinically significant role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia

We also used impedance cardiography to measure cardiac output in both groups and from the results derived values for total peripheral resistance and oxygen transport. Central venous pressure was measured with a superior vena cava catheter in patients with pre-eclampsia but not in controls. Women with pre-eclampsia had significantly lower cardiac output and central venous pressure when compared with a control group. A modest correlation was observed between central venous pressure and cardiac output. The majority of pre-eclamptic patients had significantly raised hematocrit, leucocyte count, uric acid and red cell aggregation. Red cell deformability was significantly decreased in patients with pre-eclampsia. Most patients with severe pre-eclampsia (BP diast. greater than 100 mmHg) had a low Antithrombin III and colloid osmotic pressure level. The leucocyte count was raised when compared with the women with moderate pre-eclampsia. Oxygen delivery was reduced in patients with pre-eclampsia because of impaired rheological properties of their blood.",preeclampsia
"The incidence of pre-eclampsia was studied in 9771 women that were pregnant for the first or second time. The protection offered by a previous pregnancy which ended in abortion was compared to that provided by a first pregnancy that proceeded to term. The rate of pre-eclampsia was 2.9% for primigravid women and was significantly lower (1.5%, p less than 0.001) for women giving birth for the second time. Adjusting by multiple regression for confounding factors (e.g., maternal age, social class, ethnic origin and smoking), the incidence of pre-eclampsia was also significantly lower (p = 0.038) following an induced abortion, but not following a spontaneous abortion.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia remains a major cause of maternal and fetal ill-health. Defective placentation and endothelial dysfunction appear to underlie the clinical features. Recent publications regarding the diagnosis, treatment, prediction and prevention of pre-eclampsia, and contemporary issues in the management of the haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome, are discussed in this review.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: To investigate the accuracy of predictive tests for pre-eclampsia and the effectiveness of preventative interventions for pre-eclampsia. Also to assess the cost-effectiveness of strategies (test-intervention combinations) to predict and prevent pre-eclampsia. Data sources: Major electronic databases were searched to January 2005 at least. Review methods: Systematic reviews were carried out for test accuracy and effectiveness. Quality assessment was carried out using standard tools. For test accuracy, meta-analyses used a bivariate approach. Effectiveness reviews were conducted under the auspices of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group and used standard Cochrane review methods. The economic evaluation was from an NHS perspective and used a decision tree model. Results: For the 27 tests reviewed, the quality of included studies was generally poor. Some tests appeared to have high specificity, but at the expense of compromised sensitivity. Tests that reached specificities above 90% were body mass index greater than 34, alpha-foetoprotein and uterine artery Doppler (bilateral notching). The only Doppler test with a sensitivity of over 60% was resistance index and combinations of indices. A few tests not commonly found in routine practice, such as kallikreinuria and SDS-PAGE proteinuria, seemed to offer the promise of high sensitivity, without compromising specificity, but these would require further investigation. For the 16 effectiveness reviews, the quality of included studies was variable. The largest review was of antiplatelet agents, primarily low-dose aspirin, and included 51 trials (36,500 women). This was the only review where the intervention was shown to prevent both pre-eclampsia and its consequences for the baby. Calcium supplementation also reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia, but with some uncertainty about the impact on outcomes for the baby. The only other intervention associated with a reduction in RR of pre-eclampsia was rest at home, with or without a nutritional supplement, for women with normal blood pressure. However, this review included just two small trials and its results should be interpreted with caution. The cost of most of the tests was modest, ranging from 5 pounds for blood tests such as serum uric acid to approximately 20 pounds for Doppler tests. Similarly, the cost of most interventions was also modest. In contrast, the best estimate of additional average cost associated with an average case of pre-eclampsia was high at approximately 9000 pounds. The results of the modelling revealed that prior testing with the test accuracy sensitivities and specificities identified appeared to offer little as a way of improving cost-effectiveness. Based on the evidence reviewed, none of the tests appeared sufficiently accurate to be clinically useful and the results of the model favoured no-test/treat-all strategies. Rest at home without any initial testing appeared to be the most cost-effective 'test-treatment' combination. Calcium supplementation to all women, without any initial testing, appeared to be the second most cost-effective. The economic model provided little support that any form of Doppler test has sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be cost-effective for the early identification of pre-eclampsia. It also suggested that the pattern of cost-effectiveness was no different in high-risk mothers than the low-risk mothers considered in the base case. Conclusions: The tests evaluated are not sufficiently accurate, in our opinion, to suggest their routine use in clinical practice. Calcium and antiplatelet agents, primarily low-dose aspirin, were the interventions shown to prevent pre-eclampsia. The most cost-effective approach to reducing pre-eclampsia is likely to be the provision of an effective, affordable and safe intervention applied to all mothers without prior testing to assess levels of risk. It is probably premature to suggest the implementation of a treat-all intervention strategy at present, however the feasibility and acceptability of this to women could be explored. Rigorous evaluation is needed of tests with modest cost whose initial assessments suggest that they may have high levels of both sensitivity and specificity. Similarly, there is a need for high-quality, adequately powered randomised controlled trials to investigate whether interventions such as advice to rest are indeed effective in reducing pre-eclampsia. In future, an economic model should be developed that considers not just pre-eclampsia, but other related outcomes, particularly those relevant to the infant such as perinatal death, preterm birth and small for gestational age. Such a modelling project should make provision for primary data collection on the safety of interventions and their associated costs.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia cannot be defined precisely by clinical signs which are just readily detectable secondary features of the primary abnormality within the uterus. The multisystem sequelae could be thought of as a secondary maternal adaptation, with the large variation in clinical presentation reflecting variable susceptibility of maternal target organs. The changes may be characteristic of pre-eclampsia but are not specific and therefore reflect a process rather than a discrete disease entity. Because the pathogenesis is so controversial it is not surprising that views on management differ so much.",preeclampsia
"Recent Norwegian data suggest the presence of a causal relationship between prolonged birth intervals and the risk for preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies. It has been proposed that the birth interval data explain the known association between a change in paternity and the risk for preeclampsia. In this review, the authors explore alternative explanations for the Norwegian findings, and as such argue that there is currently no reason to reject the primipaternity hypothesis.",preeclampsia
"To determine if there was an association between recto-vaginal group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization and pre-eclampsia, two cross-sectional studies were conducted using statewide hospital databases. The first study analysed data from the state of Florida, USA, and included 190 645 women who were discharged in 2001. This dataset was used to generate the hypothesis that GBS colonization is associated with pre-eclampsia. The second study tested the GBS hypothesis using the records of 577 153 women who delivered in 2004 or 2005 in Texas, USA. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for the outcome of pre-eclampsia comparing GBS-positive to GBS-negative women were calculated using logistic regression. The aOR for the association between GBS carriage and pre-eclampsia was 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.77] in the Florida dataset. In the Texas dataset, the overall prevalence of GBS carriage was 14.1% while the overall prevalence of pre-eclampsia was 4.0%. GBS carriers were 31% less likely than non-carriers to have pre-eclampsia (aOR 0.69, 95% CI 0.66-0.72) in Texas. In two large statewide analyses, GBS carriage was inversely associated with pre-eclampsia. A sensitivity analysis revealed that misclassification of GBS status is not a likely explanation of our findings.",preeclampsia
"Aim: To assess the effect of short-term pressure overload on left atrial (LA) mechanical function in pre-eclampsia. Methods: Twenty women with pre-eclampsia and 17 age-matched healthy pregnant women were included. LA volumes were measured echocardiographically at the time of mitral valve opening (Vmax), onset of atrial systole (p-wave at the electrocardiography = Vp) and mitral valve closure (Vmin) according to the biplane area-length method. Results: The mean age, gestational age, weight and body surface area were similar in pre-eclampsia and controls. The ventricular septal and posterior wall thickness were greater in pre-eclampsia (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in LA diameter, Vmax, Vmin, Vp, LA-passive emptying volume, LA-passive emptying fraction, LA-active emptying volume, LA-active emptying fraction, conduit volume, LA-total emptying volume and LA-total emptying fraction between the groups. Conclusion: Left atrial mechanical function didn't change in pre-eclampsia. We conclude that short-lasting pressure overload is not capable of inducing changes in LA function.",preeclampsia
The association of preeclampsia with thrombocytopenia and prolonged bleeding time is reported. The analysis of bleeding time (Simplate II) and the platelet count (Automatic Coulter Counter) in 41 patients with different grades of preeclampsia is presented. Our results suggest that the decrease in the bleeding time observed in moderate preeclampsia and the increase observed in severe preeclampsia are not mainly dependent on the platelet count.,preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-specific syndrome of unknown aetiology, observed in 3 - 5% of all pregnancies, associated with pathological vascular lesions in multiple organs, activation of the coagulation system, and maternal multisystemic and fetal complications. Clinically, pre-eclampsia is characterised by the onset of hypertension, proteinuria and oedema, usually beginning in the third trimester. Conventionally, antihypertensive agents are the main pharmacological treatment. Recently, some studies have shown that the treatment of pre-eclampsia with antithrombin concentrate corrects the hypercoagulability and improves the fetal status and the perinatal outcome. No clear evidence supports the use of heparin. A conservative treatment of moderate- to- severe pre-eclampsia, based on the administration of antithrombin concentrate, may allow a significant prolongation of pregnancy and a better neonatal outcome, as well as fewer maternal complications.",preeclampsia
"A reverse relationship was found between the magnesium content of drinking water, ie. an adequate supply of highly available dietary magnesium, and the occurrence of preeclampsia. Where various parts of a settlement receive their drinking water from different sources (for example, surface water or well water) there may be an important difference in the level of magnesium supply to different population groups. In the population studied here, the occurrence of preeclampsia varied pari passu with the magnesium content of the drinking water in different parts of the city. The results show that during pregnancy the magnesium content of serum and erythrocytes decreases. This decrease may be prevented by magnesium therapy, which lowers the incidence of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"The human placenta contains a significant amount of histamine, a potent vasoconstrictor of the placental vasculature, shown by the author to be stored within the tissues' mast cells. The proposed hypothesis suggests that placental mast cells may have an important role in normal and, or pathological processes during pregnancy. This suggestion will be applied to the confounding problem of pre-eclampsia, a complication of pregnancy characterised by hypertension, oedema and proteinuria, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality of mother and baby. It is postulated that pre-eclampsia reflects an inflammatory-type reaction, in which mast cell-mediated events play a significant role. The mediators released upon mast cell activation, such as histamine and prostaglandins, may be involved in the vasospasm that characterises pre-eclampsia; while processes such as uptake and clearance of vasoactive mediators by mast cells may be important in normotensive pregnancies and upset in those women who develop pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"A review of the pathophysiology and treatment of pre-eclampsia indicates that vasospasm and vascular hyperreactivity are important elements in the disease process and its control. Five requirements for a therapeutic agent in pre-eclampsia are identified: control of generalized vasospasm, hypertension, and eclamptic convulsions, maintenance of placental perfusion, and lack of adverse effects on the fetus/neonate. Calcium channel blocking agents are well known arteriolar vasodilators and inhibitors of coronary artery vasospasm, and appear to possess qualities relevant to these therapeutic requirements for pre-eclampsia. It is proposed that calcium channel blocking agents may be effective agents in the management of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-specific syndrome that may be dangerous especially to the fetus. Different cytokines have been found to be elevated in women with pre-eclampsia and may have possible roles in the development of this disorder. Alleles of the interleukin-l-beta (IL-lβ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) genes are associated with pr-eeclampsia in several studies in different populations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between IL-lβ (C+3954T) and TNF-α (G-308A) gene polymorphisms with pre-eclampsia in north east of Iran (Khorasan province).This study included 54 diagnosed patients with pre-eclampsia and 50 normal pregnant women as control group. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and the polymorphisms were determined by PCR-RFLP method. Data was analyzed using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests.There was significant association between TNF-α (G-308A) genotype and pre-eclampsia (p=0.001) but we did not find any significant association between IL-lβ (C+3954T) genotype and pre-eclampsia (p=0.39).The present study might suggest a role for TNF-α in the development of pre-eclampsia; however, IL-lβ (C+3954T) polymorphism could not be considered as a marker of susceptibility to preeclampsia in our population.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To determine whether ethnic origin is related to the clinical and biologic expression of pre-eclampsia. Methods: In a secondary analysis of information collected in the ECLAXIR study in France between May 2003 and October 2006, the data from 284 white European, 84 Maghrebian and 158 African women were evaluated in a case-control study of the genetic and endothelial determinants of pre-eclampsia. Results: African origin was a risk factor for pre-eclampsia before 28 weeks of gestation. Symptoms related to hypertension, such as neurologic signs and changes in biologic parameters (e.g. hemolysis elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count [HELLP] syndrome), occurred more frequently among white European women. After logistic regression, gestational age at delivery was lower for African women than for white European women (33.4 weeks versus 34.4 weeks of gestation, P=0.04). Conclusion: The results suggest that ethnic origin may have a role in the expression of pre-eclampsia, and should therefore be taken into account in prenatal surveillance. Further research on the genetic factors involved in endothelial dysfunction is warranted.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To investigate the expression of placenta-derived RASSF1A gene in maternal plasma during first and second trimesters, and to explore its value for the prediction of pre-eclampsia. Methods: For 325 pregnant women of the first trimester, free DNA of plasma samples was extracted at 7-12, 13-18, and 19-24 gestational weeks, respectively. Methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion followed by fluorescence quantitative PCR (MSRE+ PCR) was employed for analyzing the concentrations of hypermethylated RASSF1A gene. Blood pressure, proteinuria and clinical feature were monitored at the same time. Those who had subsequently developed pre-eclampsia were selected as the pre-eclamptic group, 30 normal pregnant women were selected as the control group. Hypermethylated RASSF1A gene in maternal plasma was retrospectively analyzed. The relationship between clinical classification, type of pre-eclampsia and concentrations of the gene were further analyzed. Results: Twenty-six out of the 325 pregnant women developed pre-eclampsia as their only complication. At 13-18 gestational weeks, the mean concentrations of fetus-specific RASSF1A sequences were 141.62 copies/mL in maternal plasma of pre-eclamptic pregnancies, which was significantly greater than that of the controls (98.90 copies/mL). Fetus-derived RASSF1A levels were 2.03 fold higher in pre-eclamptic subjects than controls at 19-24 gestational weeks. There was a significant difference in the level of hypermethylated RASSF1A gene between the mild and severe pre-clamptic subjects at 13-24 gestational weeks (P< 0.05). The concentrations of the sequences were significantly higher in early-onset severe pre-eclampsia than late-onset severe pre-eclampsia at 19-24 gestational weeks (P< 0.05). Conclusion: Altered expression of hypermethylated RASSF1A gene may be detected in maternal plasma during second trimester, which has important significance for early prediction of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a serious obstetric complication, not only affect maternal health, but also affect the long-term prognosis of offspring generation. Even though various theories on the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia have been proposed in recent decades, it remains unclear due to the disadvantages in these theories. Therefore, the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia keeps attracting a lot of research efforts in the field of obstetrics. In order to find the new break through points in the study of pre-eclampsia pathogenesis (pre-eclampsia related to genetic, epigenetic and expression changes of some genes), it is necessary to illustrate and understand the research status in this field, with integrating the related resources, updating the new progress, ideas and extensive research means.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is characterized by increased lipid peroxidation and diminished antioxidant capacity. The aim of the study was to establish concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances as a marker of lipid peroxidation in normal pregnancies and in pregnancies complicated with pre-eclampsia, and to estimate the possibility of using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances as a screening method for development of pre-eclampsia. The study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Clinical Centre of Vojvodina. The study included 57 singleton pregnancies, gestation > or = 24 weeks, of which 29 were healthy pregnancies and 28 were with pre-eclampsia, defined as systolic arterial pressure of > or = 90 mmHg, diastolic of > or = 145 mmHg, and 24h proteinuria of > or = 300 mg. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentrations evaluated by malondialdehyde equivalent standards (OxiSelect TBARS Assay Kit (malondialdehyde Quantitation), Cell Biolabs' OxiSelect) showed that oxidative stress was more evident in the group with pre-eclampsia, though not statistically significant (p = 0.107). There was no correlation ofthiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels with gestation in either group. The differences between the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance concentrations in pre-eclampsia and healthy pregnancies indicate the possibility of using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances as a screening tool for the development of pre-eclampsia. Further studies with larger numbers of patients are needed in order to come to final conclusions.",preeclampsia
"An expert's conference about Intensive Care in preeclampsia was organized by the French Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care (SFAR) associated with the societies of Pediatrics (SFP) and Obstetricians (SFMP and CNGOF). Each expert wrote a chapter according to instructions previously defined by the Referential Committee of Sfar. The coordinator was in charge of a short text which was presented to each society. The main issue was the intensive care management, but chapters about epidemiology, pathology and physiopathology were also included. Principles of care in less severe cases were also added as well as prognosis in mothers and babies. Finally, mandatory anesthetic requirements of were also presented. The aim of this work was to take stock of the state of art in severe preeclampsia. Due to improved knowledge, intensive care strategies for severe pre-eclampsia will have to be updated in the near future.",preeclampsia
"Severe preeclampsia in the second trimester presents a major challenge in management because it is associated with high perinatal mortality. One possible way to improve the perinatal outcome in these pregnancies is to predict the later development of preeclampsia and to start management of it early. To investigate the relationship between the timing of the rise in maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the course of biparietal diameter (BPD) growth in the fetus, we reviewed seven women with preeclampsia diagnosed between 18 and 27 weeks' gestation. MAP increased slowly within the normal range three or four weeks before the onset of the disease. Slowing of the fetal BPD growth curve preceded the onset of preeclampsia by two to four weeks. Serial measurement of BPD from early pregnancy may prevent the onset of severe preeclampsia before 28 weeks' gestation.",preeclampsia
"Full HLA-A, B and DR types were obtained for 22 families (mothers, fathers and neonates) associated with severe (proteinuric) pre-eclampsia, 21 families associated with mild pre-eclampsia, and 132 families associated with normal pregnancies. There was an increased frequency of DR4 (relative risk 3.6: p less than 0.003, uncorrected) in both neonates and mothers of the severe pre-eclampsia families when compared to the normotensive controls. There were no significant differences between either pre-eclampsia group and controls in HLA antigen homozygosity, HLA antigen sharing or in lymphocytotoxin production.",preeclampsia
"Pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders, and especially preeclampsia, are documented to occur primarily in first pregnancies and rarely in subsequent pregnancies. Therefore, the concept of primigravidity is the epidemiological cornerstone of this disease. The authors propose a concept in which preeclampsia is a disease of new couples, especially after a short period of sexual cohabitation, and explore if this alternative primipaternity model, as compared with the primigravidity concept, provides a better fit with well-known epidemiologic descriptions. First, the primipaternity model provides a mathematical modelling which may explain the prevalence of approximately 10% in long-term monogamic populations. Further, it proposes explanations for many epidemiological descriptions which were previously difficult to understand and assemble in a single concept.",preeclampsia
"Introduction: Pre-eclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. It occurs in 7% of all the pregnancies and accounts for 80% of the cases of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Diagnosis of pre-eclampsia in patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease, proteinuria, and hypertension is a dilemma. The fractional excretion of urea has been described as a marker for renal perfusion. Since pre-eclampsia is associated with a marked decline in renal perfusion, we explored the utility of the fractional excretion of urea as a marker for pre-eclampsia. Materials and methods: Urine and serum chemistries were evaluated in 6 pregnant women with pre-eclampsia on their first visit, immediately prior to delivery, and postpartum. For each of these three measurements, the fractional excretion of urea was calculated and proteinuria was assessed by random urine protein-creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine protein studies. Results: In patients diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, the fractional excretion of urea decreased substantially from higher values obtained during the 3rd trimester to values consistent with renal hypoperfusion (< 35%) just prior to delivery, and it rapidly normalized immediately after delivery. Conclusions: Alterations in fractional excretion of urea, which suggest a decreased renal perfusion, may be a useful tool in supporting the diagnosis of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"This chapter summarizes the identification, assessment and management of women with established pre-eclampsia. Guidelines for out-patient management and in-patient treatment are given and are based on clinical experience and published reports. Drug treatment options are briefly reviewed and the timing of delivery is discussed. A comprehensive regimen for the intrapartum management of severe pre-eclampsia is provided founded on protocols used in the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, over recent years. The chapter emphasizes the importance of medical history, clinical examination and investigations when arriving at what are often difficult clinical decisions. Controversial areas are highlighted with reference to recent published reports.",preeclampsia
"Introduction: Hyperandrogenism may be implicated in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. We hypothesised that there may be a difference between the levels of testosterone in pregnant women complicated with pre-eclampsia and those of matched women without this complication. Material and methods: A case-control study conducted in Tehran, Iran between January and June 2006 included 20 women with moderate to severe pre-eclampsia and 20 normotensive pregnant women without complications who were matched for age, body mass index and gravity. Maternal levels of free testosterone was measured in the two groups and compared. Results: Free testosterone levels were significantly higher in the pre-eclamptic group (mean = 1.97, SD = 0.58, median = 1.90 ng/dL) than in the control group (mean = 0.58, SD = 0.29, median=0.50 ng/dL) (P < 0.001). Conclusions: An increase in serum free testosterone concentration may be considered an important risk factor for pre-eclampsia and might be implicated in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Our understanding of the pathophysiologic abnormalities contributing to pre-eclampsia has increased substantially over the past decade. This has been accompanied by the introduction of various methods which reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia to approximately the same range (4-11.8% in high risk group), by attempting to correct the pathophysiologic abnormalities involved, rather than averting its occurrence. Numerous reports suggest that pre-eclampsia is caused by an abnormal maternal immune response to antigenic challenge by the fetoplacental allograft. If this assumption is true, it may be possible to manipulate the maternal immune response to fetal allograft and to assist the immunologic homeostasis of the maternal host with her conceptus by passive immunization with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) and thus, to prevent pre-eclampsia. Recently IV preparations of Ig have become available for clinical use including treatment of various immunologic disorders during pregnancy. The effectiveness of this new mode of therapy can be related to several immunological mechanisms such as blockade of antibody binding to receptors on macrophages, increase in T suppressor cells, or decrease in antibody synthesis. The latter effect may be mediated by anti-idiotypic antibodies in the Ig preparation, which may bind to idiotypes on pathogenic autoantibodies and neutralise their activity.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive diseases in pregnancy are common and are associated with significant maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Risk factors for pre-eclampsia include socio-demographical factors (extremes of reproductive age, socio-economic status, ethnic group), genetic factors, pregnancy factors (multiple pregnancies, primigravidae, previous pre-eclampsia) or personal medical history (obesity, chronic renal disease, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, thrombophilia). These risk factors and Doppler screening can help target interventions such as aspirin and calcium that have been proven to reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia in high risk women. Expectant management is the mainstay of treatment for pre-eclampsia. Hypertension should be controlled by oral or intravenous antihypertensive agents as necessary. Magnesium sulphate is the agent of choice for both the treatment and prevention of eclampsia. Fluid balance and thromboprophylaxis are also both important elements in the management of severe pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Epidemiologic studies have shown that pre-eclampsia is mainly a disease of first pregnancy, possibly associated with primipaternity. The interpregnancy interval, which is strongly associated with change of partner, has received little attention. In this study, based on Danish hospital records, we evaluated whether the interpregnancy interval may confound or modify the paternal effect on pre-eclampsia. We studied the outcome of the second birth in a cohort of Danish women with pre-eclampsia in the previous birth (8,401 women) and in all women with pre-eclampsia in second (but not first) birth together with a sample of women with two births (26,596 women). A long interpregnancy interval was associated with a higher risk of pre-eclampsia in women with no previous pre-eclampsia when the father was the same. We estimated the risk of pre-eclampsia in second birth according to paternal change in different models. Although partner change was associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia in women with no history of pre-eclampsia, this effect disappeared after adjustment for the interpregnancy interval. We saw, however, different results when we stratified on the length of the interval. Our results indicate that the interval between births should be taken into consideration when studying the effect of changing partner on pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To determine the risk factors for severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. Design: A case control study. Setting: Mulago Hospital labour ward Subject: One hundread and fourty three women with severe pre-eclampsia/eclampsia and 500 women with normal delivery. Results: The predictors of severe pre-eclampsia/eclampsia were: low socio - economic status (OR 7.6, 95%CI 3.9 - 26.9), chronic hypertension (OR 26.9, 95% CI 4.3-170.4), family history of hypertension (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.9), nulliparity (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.3) and delivery of male babies (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.3). Conclusion: Severe pre- eclampsia is one of the main causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in Mulago hospital. The predictors of severe pre - eclampsia were chronic hypertension, family history of hypertension, low socio - economic status, nulliparity and delivering male babies. Health workers need to identify women at risk and offer them counseling and, those who develop pre - eclampsia be referred and managed in hospitals with expertise and facilities. Those who develop severe pre-eclampsia should be delivered immediately so as to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia affects 5 - 8% of pregnancies in the USA and 3 - 14% of pregnancies worldwide. Classically, the syndrome includes hypertension and proteinuria that may be associated with edema, headache and worsening epigastric pain. This is postulated from vasospasm and endothelial cell damage. Hyponatremia in pre-eclamptic pregnancies has been described in few cases, most of which were twin pregnancies, and four of them had nephrotic syndrome. The management of hyponatremia requires a multidisciplinary approach and significant attention, as this condition can predispose to convulsions along with pre-eclampsia, thus, endangering the life of the mother and the child. We describe a case of a patient who developed pre-eclampsia and hyponatremia in the absence of proteinuria, at 34 weeks of a twin pregnancy; there was progression to oliguria with complete remission following delivery by cesarean section.",preeclampsia
"Ideal method of anaesthesia during caesarean section in women with severe pre-eclampsia is difficult to decide. The aim and objective of the study were to compare neonatal outcome in women with severe pre-eclampsia, undergoing caesarean section in intrapartum period, either under general or spinal anaesthesia. Women with severe pre-eclampsia, undergoing caesarean section in intrapartum period, were included in the study. Diastolic blood pressure was kept below 100mm Hg by giving parenteral labetalol pre-operatively. All women received prophylactic magnesium sulphate (5g IV and 10g IM). Maternal blood- gas parameters were measured. Scalp blood pH estimation was done in all cases. Women undergoing caesarean section were randomised into two groups and received either spinal or general anaesthesia. Umbilical arterial catheterisation was done for collecting blood for estimating neonatal blood- gas parameters. Complete data was available in 82 women. Both the groups were comparable in terms of general demographic data, except that percentage of women having an induced labour was significantly more in the general anaesthesia group. Induction of anaesthesia and delivery interval was prolonged for the spinal group. Mean dose of phenylephrine was significantly higher for the spinal anaesthesia group. Preoperative maternal blood-gas parameters and foetal scalp blood pH were comparable in between groups. Difference in neonatal umbilical artery base deficit in between groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.99). Correlation coefficient between maternal base deficit and foetal base deficit was 0.414 (p = 0.01) and 0.06 (p > 0.1) respectively for general and spinal anaesthesia. Subgroup analysis in the population with pre-operative scalp blood pH < 7.2, neonatal umbilical artery base deficit was significantly higher in general anaesthesia group. Five minutes APGAR score was comparable but resuscitation at birth was more common in the general anaesthesia group. Correlation coefficient between maternal base deficit and foetal base deficit in this subgroup was 0.42 (p = 0.05) and -0.57 (p < 0.05) respectively for general and spinal anaesthesia.",preeclampsia

"Objective: To examine the association between physical activity in early pregnancy and risk of pre-eclampsia. Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: Denmark. Population: A total of 85,139 pregnant Danish women, recruited between 1996 and 2002. Methods: The authors assessed leisure time physical activity in first trimester by a telephone interview and categorised women a priori into seven groups: 0 (reference), 1-44, 45-74, 75-149, 150-269, 270-419 and 420+ minutes/week. Pre-eclampsia diagnoses were extracted from the Danish National Patient Registry. A number of potential confounders were adjusted for by logistic regression. Main outcome measures: Pre-eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia. Results: The two highest physical activity levels were associated with increased risk of severe pre-eclampsia compared with the nonexercising group, with adjusted odds ratios of 1.65 (95% CI: 1.11-2.43) and 1.78 (95% CI: 1.07-2.95), whereas more moderate levels of physical activity (1-270 minutes/week) had no statistically significant association with risk of pre-eclampsia (total n = 85,139). Conclusions: We were unable to document a protective effect of leisure time physical activity against pre-eclampsia. Our data even suggest that leisure time physical activity exceeding 270 minutes/week in first trimester may increase risk of severe pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is pregnancy induced hypertension of unknown aetiology. There is a paucity of maternal data on the disease from this region and this study was undertaken to identify maternal and possible aetiologic factors associated with the disease in the north western region of Saudi Arabia. Seven hundred and five consecutive maternities which delivered from October 1990 till January 1991 at the Armed Forces Hospital were analysed. 2.8% of women in this community study developed pre-eclampsia. Women at extremes of maternal age, the nulliparous and high parity women; women with high body mass index, blood group O and those with no antenatal care or late booking in this study were at greater risk of developing pre-eclampsia when compared with controls who delivered in the same period. Of the babies born to mothers with pre-eclampsia, 46.7% were of low birthweight (< 2500g) while only 10.4% of controls were low birthweight. It is concluded that mothers with pre-eclampsia have to be identified early. Potential modifiable factors include reducing pregnancies at extremes of maternal age, among high parity women and encouraging early booking as well as regular attendance at the antenatal clinic.",preeclampsia
"Severe edema-proteinuria-hypertension (EPH) gestosis (pre-eclampsia) appears in at least two forms (A and B). The A type is mostly complicated by fits, while the B type is characterized by multiple organ failure. The perinatal mortality rate is especially high in the B group. All gravid women with severe EPH gestosis benefit from blood volume expansion therapy.",preeclampsia
"Background: Because the reported frequency of pre-eclampsia in Taiwan varies significantly, the aims of this study were to measure the current incidence of pre-eclampsia and its correlated morbidity and mortality for both mothers and fetuses in Taiwan. Methods: We retrospectively studied all reported cases of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1997 in the 14 tertiary medical centers and regional hospitals in Taiwan. Recruiting criteria were pregnancy-induced hypertension (systolic blood pressure > or = 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mmHg) with proteinuria (> or = 300 mg of urinary protein per 24 hours) and independent part edema. Results: There were 4,193 patients with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia for a frequency of 2.03% of 206,551 deliveries during the study period. Of these, 58.9% of patients were classified as having mild pre-eclampsia while 38.4% had severe pre-eclampsia. Advanced maternal age (> 35 years) (odds ratio [OR] = 4.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.23-4.90; p < 0.001), primiparity (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.61-1.82; p = 0.02) and twin pregnancy (OR = 1.92; 95% CI = 1.64-2.25; p = 0.01) were significant risk factors for developing pre-eclampsia. However, multivariate analysis showed that only advanced maternal age was a significant risk factor for pre-eclampsia (OR = 3.21; 95% CI = 2.95-3.50; p < 0.001). In contrast to mild pre-eclampsia, severe pre-eclampsia resulted in significantly worse outcomes for both mothers and fetuses. Complications in patients with severe pre-eclampsia included placental abruption, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, postpartum hemorrhage, pleural effusion, preterm labor, intrauterine growth retardation, stillbirth, neonatal mortality and low birth weight infants, all of which occurred significantly more frequently than in patients with mild pre-eclampsia (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Pre-eclampsia remains a big challenge in modern obstetrics in Taiwan. Early diagnosis and management of patients with pre-eclampsia to prevent progression would significantly improve outcomes for mothers and fetuses.",preeclampsia
"The clinical features of the maternal syndrome of pre-eclampsia can be explained by generalised maternal endothelial cell dysfunction, which is a part of a more global maternal systemic inflammatory response. There is growing evidence that these effects are associated with the shedding of cellular debris, including syncytiotrophoblast microparticles (STBM), cell-free DNA and mRNA, from the surface of the placenta (syncytiotrophoblast) into the maternal circulation. The increased shedding of this debris seen in pre-eclampsia is believed to be caused by placental ischaemia, reperfusion and oxidative stress. This study was carried out to determine whether uterine contractions during labour and subsequent placental separation lead to an acute increase in the release of placental debris into the maternal circulation. To assess the effects of labour, samples were taken from 10 normal pregnant (NP) and 10 pre-eclamptic (PE) women at varied time points. Similarly to assess the effects of placental delivery, plasma samples were taken from 10 NP and 10 PE women undergoing elective caesarean section. There was a significant increase in the shedding of STBM in pre-eclampsia which was not seen in normal pregnancy and there was a small rise in STBM levels at placental separation in both normal pregnant and pre-eclamptic women undergoing caesarean section, but the differences were not significant. However, levels of placental cell-free corticotrophin releasing hormone mRNA were significantly increased in labour in both normal pregnancy and pre-eclampsia and were still high 24 h after delivery in the pre-eclamptic women. There was no significant increase in fetal or total DNA in labour, but the overall levels of total DNA (maternal and fetal) was increased in labour in pre-eclampsia compared to normal labour. The enhanced shedding of STBM and CRH mRNA in pre-eclampsia labour may have a role in cases of postpartum worsening of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
Usefulness of the standard test to control hemostatic balance has been evaluated in 22 pregnant women in III trimester with preeclampsia. Unpregnant and pregnant healthy women there were the control group. Increase of the fibrinogen concentration and the fibrinolysis time prolongation have been confirmed as well as increase of the degradation fibrin/ogen products (FDP/fdp) concentration (significantly the highest in the women with moderate preeclampsia). The remaining parameters of hemostasis in women with preeclampsia there were within laboratory standards.,preeclampsia
"Objective: The first aim of this study was to investigate the risk of pre-eclampsia, both mild and severe, in women born small for gestational age (SGA). The second aim was to investigate whether the risk is modified by pre-eclampsia in the previous generation. Design: Population-based cohort study. Setting: Sweden. Population: A population of 118 634 women registered both as newborns and as mothers in the Swedish Medical Birth Register of 1973-2003. Of these, 6883 had been born SGA. Only primiparas and singletons were included. Methods: The pregnancies that the women were born out of were analysed with regard to presence of pre-eclampsia, while their own pregnancies were analysed regarding age at delivery, smoking, body mass index and incidence of mild or severe pre-eclampsia. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used. In a first step, we adjusted for maternal characteristics, and in a second step, for pre-eclampsia in the previous generation. Main outcome measures: Odds ratio for mild and severe pre-eclampsia. Results: In women born SGA, the adjusted odds ratio (first step) for mild pre-eclampsia was 1.19 (95% CI 1.03-1.38), while for severe pre-eclampsia it was 1.69 (95% CI 1.40-2.02) compared with those not born SGA. After the second-step adjustment, the odds ratio for mild pre-eclampsia was 1.16 (95% CI 1.00-1.35) and for severe pre-eclampsia was 1.62 (95% CI 1.35-1.95). No statistically significant effect modification from pre-eclampsia in the previous generation was shown. Conclusions: Women born SGA suffer a markedly increased risk of severe pre-eclampsia. Exposure to pre-eclampsia during a woman's own fetal development significantly increases her risk of pre-eclampsia but does not modify the SGA effect.",preeclampsia
"Circulating immune (antigen-antibody) complexes have been proposed as possible important in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Thirty-four serum samples from pre-eclamptic women were examined for the presence of antigen-antibody complexes by the C1q binding and Raji cell assays. Slightly abnormal C1q binding occurred in two serum samples, while all Raji cell determinations were found to be in the normal range for a healthy, nonpregnant population. It is concluded that circulating immune complexes do not occur regularly in pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia is a specific disease of pregnancy with multisystem complications. We conducted this study to examine the relationship between lactic dehydrogenase concentration and the severity of the disease and the occurrence of its complications. Material/methods: One hundred eleven pre-eclamptic women (49 with mild and 62 with severe pre-eclampsia) and 60 healthy normotensive controls were studied prospectively at the King Hussein Medical Center between January and December 2002. Demographic, hemodynamic, and laboratory data were compared among the three groups. The symptoms and complications of severe pre-eclampsia along with fetal outcome were analyzed according to the levels of LDH (<600, 600-800, and >800 IU/l). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the chi-square test were used to compare the results. Differences were considered significant when p<0.05. Results: The incidence of severe pre-eclampsia was 1.3%. Severely pre-eclamptic patients were significantly younger, with low gravidity and parity. On the other hand, they had significantly increased systolic and diastolic pressure and liver enzymes, uric acid, urine albumin, and LDH levels. The symptoms and complications of pre-eclampsia along with perinatal mortality were increased significantly in patients with LDH >800 IU/l compared with those who had lower levels. Conclusions: Lactic dehydrogenase is a useful biochemical marker that reflects the severity of and the occurrence of complications of pre-eclampsia. Identification of high-risk patients with elevated levels of lactic dehydrogenase, their close monitoring, and prompt, correct management may prevent these complications, with a subsequent decrease in maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.",preeclampsia
Midwives must be alert to the possibility of pre-eclampsia by: Taking accurate and detailed genetic histories. Taking consistent blood pressure measurements. Testing urine for protein at every visit. Observing generalised oedema. Advising clients that headaches and epigastric pain should not be ignored. Fetal monitoring for intrauterine growth retardation.,preeclampsia
"The morphological changes in the functional structure of the placenta in cases of pre-eclampsia associated with severe intrauterine growth retardation have been investigated with quantitative analyses. It has been demonstrated that in pregnancies complicated by severe pre-eclampsia, the placenta can suffer significant morphological alterations characterized by an abnormal maturation or arborization of the terminal villi. The findings of this study suggest that, among the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the observed placental changes, uteroplacental ischaemia is probably a dominant factor, and that any ill effects on fetal growth and viability are very likely to be related not only to the inadequate maternal supply of oxygen and nutrients but also to placental ischaemic damage.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To examine the effect of cardiovascular risk factors before pregnancy on risk of pre-eclampsia. Design: Population based prospective study. Setting: Linkage between a Norwegian population based study (Nord-Trøndelag health study, HUNT-2) and Norway's medical birth registry. Participants: 3494 women who gave birth after participating in the Nord-Trøndelag health study at baseline; of whom 133 (3.8%) delivered after a pre-eclamptic pregnancy. Main outcome measure: Odds ratio of developing pre-eclampsia. Results: After adjustment for smoking; previous pre-eclampsia; parity; maternal age, education, and socioeconomic position; and duration between baseline measurements and delivery, positive associations were found between prepregnancy serum levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure and risk of pre-eclampsia. The odds ratio of developing pre-eclampsia for women with baseline systolic blood pressures greater than 130 mm Hg (highest fifth) was 7.3 (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 17.2) compared with women with systolic blood pressures less than 111 mm Hg (lowest fifth). Similar results were found for nulliparous and parous women. Women who used oral contraceptives at baseline had half the risk of pre-eclampsia compared with never or former users (0.5, 0.3 to 0.9). Conclusion: Women with cardiovascular risk factors may be predisposed to pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Background: Despite a huge body of published research, understanding the basic pathology that leads to pre-eclampsia is still incomplete. This study was conducted among women in north Jordan to determine factors associated with pre-eclampsia and to determine if dental caries was involved. Methods: A case-control study was carried out among women who delivered at Princess Badea Teaching Hospital, Irbid, North Jordan, between September 1, 2004 and January 1, 2005. 115 women with pre-eclampsia and 230 normotensive controls were included in the study. Information regarding participants' demographics, antenatal history and family history were collected through personal interviews. Several oral parameters were measured for each participant. Results: In multivariate analysis, factors found to be associated with increased odds of pre-eclampsia were age > or =35 years (adjusted OR 2.20; 95% CI 1.08, 4.48), nulliparity (adjusted OR 2.73; 95% CI 1.38, 5.39), emotional stress during pregnancy (adjusted OR 4.22; 95% CI 1.79, 9.90), maternal history of pre-eclampsia (adjusted OR 16.04; 95% CI 5.82, 44.22), family history of cardiovascular diseases (adjusted OR 2.82; 95% CI 1.22, 6.51), family history of pre-eclampsia (adjusted OR 23.26; 95% CI 5.07, 106.78), twin births (adjusted OR 37.79; 95% CI 4.22, 338.51), and Body Mass Index (BMI). In comparison with women with pre-pregnancy BMI <25, adjusted OR were 1.97, 95% CI 1.02, 3.81 for women with BMI from 25 to 29.9, and 3.31, 95% CI 1.36, 8.03 for women with BMI > or =30. Mean decayed teeth surface was found to be associated with increased odds of pre-eclampsia (adjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.03, 1.27). Conclusion: This study demonstrated no difference to reported risk indicators of pre-eclampsia in other populations, but adds that dental caries may have an association with increased odds of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To compare the efficacy of uterine artery Doppler velocimetry and three-dimensional ultrasound placental volume calculation alone or in combination in predicting at 11-14 weeks of gestation those pregnancies who will develop pre-eclampsia. Study design: This was a prospective study of 348 nulliparous women scheduled for a routine prenatal ultrasound examination at 11-14 weeks. Color and pulsed wave Doppler was used to obtain uterine artery flow velocity waveforms transabdominally and the mean pulsatility index (PI) of the uterine arteries was calculated. The placental volume was measured by three-dimensional ultrasound using the virtual organ computer-aided analysis. Outcome variables considered were pre-eclampsia and pre-eclampsia requiring delivery <32 weeks. Results: Pre-eclampsia developed in 4.1% of the patients studied and in 1.7% a delivery before 32 weeks was required. Placental volume resulted significantly lower in pregnancies who will develop pre-eclampsia (t=4.636, p<0.003) and this was particularly evident in those pregnancies delivering <32 weeks (t=9.704, p<0.0002). No relationship was found between placental volume and mean uterine artery PI (r=-0.08, p=0.327). Uterine artery PI and placental volume showed similar sensitivities in predicting pre-eclampsia (50% vs. 56%) and pre-eclampsia with delivery <32 weeks (66.7% vs. 66.7%). The combination of uterine artery PI and placental volume gave better results when compared to the single use of one of these parameters (pre-eclampsia sensitivity 68.7%, pre-eclampsia requiring delivery <32 weeks 83.3%). Conclusions: The combination of abnormal uterine artery Doppler and low placental volume at 11-14 weeks achieves better results than does either test alone in the prediction of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Introduction: Pre-eclampsia is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Its etiology is still unknown. Clinical symptoms correlate with activation of coagulation and inherited thrombophilia has been associated with pre-eclampsia. ABO blood group has been associated with thrombotic disorders and pre-eclampsia. We assessed ABO blood group, seven thrombophilia associated polymorphisms, and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies as risk factors for pre-eclampsia. Materials and methods: We performed a population-based nested case-control study of 100,000 consecutive pregnancies in Finland. Cases and controls were identified by combining national registers and medical records were reviewed. We studied 248 cases fulfilling strict criteria for pre-eclampsia and 679 controls. Severe pre-eclampsia, early pre-eclampsia, and pre-eclampsia with intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) were analyzed separately. Results: Blood group AB increased the risk for pre-eclampsia as a whole (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.5), and in the three subgroups (OR 2.3, 3.8, 3.4; 95% CI 1.3-3.9, 2.0-7.1, 1.6-7.1). FV Leiden increased the risk as a whole (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.8-3.9), and in the three subgroups, although not statistically significantly. Anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies were not associated with pre-eclampsia. High body mass index, diabetes, first pregnancy, and twin pregnancy increased the risk from 1.5-fold to 8.2-fold. Conclusions: Our results confirm and extend the prior observation of blood group AB being a risk factor for pre-eclampsia. ABO blood group is known from all pregnant women. The value of blood group as risk factor for pre-eclampsia should be further assessed in prospective studies. In this study, FV Leiden was not statistically significant risk factor.",preeclampsia
"Despite advances in antenatal and intrapartum care, hypertensive disorders remain the second most common cause of maternal mortality. The Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the United Kingdom (1988-90) (Department of Health, 1994) demonstrated that the number of deaths where hypertensive disease was the direct cause had not decreased since the previous trienium. The morbidity from this condition remains largely unquantified and many aspects of the aetiology and disease processes remain unknown.",preeclampsia
"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of conservative management of pre-eclampsia with onset in the second trimester on fetomaternal outcome. This was a prospective study of 749 consecutive cases of pre-eclampsia seen over a 5-year period in a tertiary care centre in Enugu, Eastern Nigeria. One hundred and seventy-five (23.4%) of the 749 cases started at less than 30 weeks' gestational age. These early-onset cases formed the study group, while the remaining 574 with onset at 30 weeks' gestation or later (the late-onset cases) served as controls. The two groups were compared for some fetomaternal outcome variables at the 95% confidence level. Ninety-one (52%) of the early-onset group had pure pre-eclampsia while the remaining 84 were thought to have pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. The mean gain in gestational age in the early-onset group was 8.8 +/- 1.5 (range: 0-19) weeks. Compared to the late-onset group, the early-onset group had a twofold increase in maternal mortality ratio and a significantly increased incidence of renal failure and HELLP syndrome. The perinatal mortality rate increased fourfold in the early-onset compared to the late-onset group due principally to prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction. The perinatal mortality rate was, however, comparable to results from similar Caucasian studies. It was concluded that there has been an increased incidence of early-onset pre-eclampsia in Nigerian women. Although conservative management of such cases may improve fetal results, it is associated with increased maternal mortality and morbidity because of institutional delays and non-availability of magnesium sulphate at the time of the study. Minimising institutional delays, providing magnesium sulphate and improving neonatal services will enhance maternal and fetal results in early-onset pre-eclampsia in Nigeria and are recommended.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: Pre-eclampsia is an important cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia in most studies. Nutritional and genetic factors regulate homocyst(e)ine levels. A missense mutation 677 C-->T in the gene for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) has been associated with an increased pre-eclampsia risk in some, although not most, previously studied populations. Methods: To further understand the role of this polymorphism in the etiology of pre-eclampsia, we genotyped a total of 125 pre-eclamptics and 179 normotensive pregnant Peruvian women. Results: The wild-type allele frequency among cases and controls was 54% and 58%, respectively. Twenty percent of cases and 17% of controls were homozygous for the 677 C-->T MTHFR genotype (T/T). After adjustment for confounding by covariates including maternal age, nulliparity, pre-pregnancy body mass index and use of prenatal vitamins, women homozygous for the 677 C-->T MTHFR genotype (T/T) experienced a modest, statistically non-significant increased risk of pre-eclampsia (adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.7, 3.8). Maternal folate deficiency was associated with a statistically non-significant doubling in risk of pre-eclampsia in this population (adjusted OR 2.0, 95% CI 0.9, 4.3). Conclusions: There was no evidence to suggest that pre-eclampsia risk is positively associated with the T/T genotype overall, or in the context of folate deficiency.",preeclampsia
"Background: Long time interval between pregnancies has been found to increase the risk of pre-eclampsia in second pregnancy. Our aim was to investigate whether this effect is influenced by a history of pre-eclampsia or a change in paternity. Methods: We studied 547 238 women with a first and second pregnancy registered in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, 1967-1998. The relative risk of pre-eclampsia in the second delivery according to time interval between deliveries was estimated as odds ratios (OR) in logistic regression models, controlling for changing paternity, maternal age and calendar time period in women with and without previous pre-eclampsia. Results: A change of paternity for the second pregnancy was associated with a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia after controlling for the time since first delivery (adjusted OR = 0.80, 95% CI : 0.72-0.90), but the interaction between change in paternity and time between deliveries was significant only for women with no previous pre-eclampsia. The interaction between history of pre-eclampsia and time interval between the two deliveries was highly significant, and for women with no previous pre-eclampsia the risk of pre-eclampsia in second pregnancy increased with increasing time interval (for intervals longer than 15 years the adjusted OR was 2.11, 95% CI : 1.75-2.53). For women with previous pre-eclampsia the risk tended to decrease with increasing time interval between deliveries. Conclusions: The protective impact of a new father for the second pregnancy challenges the hypothesis of primipaternity, and implies that the increase in pre-eclampsia risk ascribed to new father by others is due to insufficient control for interpregnancy interval.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To investigate the expression of HIF-1alpha protein in the placenta bed and the concentration of von Willrand factor (vWF) in maternal peripheral blood from pre-eclampsia and normal pregnancy, and to determine the effect of HIF-1alpha and vWF on the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Methods: Forty pre-eclampsia patients (20 mild and 20 severe) were recruited as 2 study groups, and another 20 normal pregnant women were served as a normal group.Western blot was used to detect the expression of HIF-1alpha protein in the placenta bed. ELISA was adopted to detect the concentration of vWF in the maternal peripheral blood.Correlation between HIF-1alpha protein expression and vWF level was analyzed by Spearman method. Results: The expression of HIF-1alpha protein in the placenta bed was the highest in the severe pre-eclampsia patients among 3 groups, followed by the mild pre-eclampsia patients and the normal controls. There was significant difference among 3 groups (P<0.001). The concentration of vWF in the maternal peripheral blood was the highest in the severe pre-eclampsia patients, followed by the mild pre-eclampsia patients and the normal controls. There was significant difference among the 3 groups (P<0.05). Positive correlation was found between the expression of HIF-1alpha protein in the placenta bed and the concentration of vWF in the maternal peripheral blood in patients with pre-eclampsia (r1=0.65, P<0.001), and between the concentration of vWF in the maternal peripheral blood and the pathogenetic condition degree of pre-eclampsia (r(2)=0.61,P<0.001). Conclusion: HIF-1alpha in coordination with vWF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"The common neurological manifestations of pre-eclampsia include headache, confusion, and visual disturbance; while isolated abducens nerve palsy in pre-eclampsia is very rare. We report one case of a severe pre-eclampsia with abducens nerve palsy at 39 weeks' gestation. There was no specific pathology, except hypertension, and the palsy resolved spontaneously.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To investigate the level of hypermethylated ras association domain family 1A (RASSF1A) gene in maternal plasma of pre-eclampsia and its clinical value. Methods: Sixty pre-eclampsia women including 30 mild and 30 severe cases were selected, 60 women with normal pregnancy were studied as control. Free DNA from plasma samples was extracted, fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) was used to detect the concentrations of RASSF1A gene before and after methylation-sensitive restriction digestion. Meanwhile, beta-actin gene was detected as a control to confirm complete enzyme digestion. Results: The median concentration of hypermethylated RASSF1A gene was 3.31-fold higher in samples from pre-eclamptic pregnancies than that in controls. There was significant difference between the mild and severe pre-eclamptic subjects (P<0.05), with the median concentrations of 1659 copies/mL and 2036.50 copies/mL, respectively. Conclusion: Hypermethylated RASSF1A gene in pre-eclampsia plasma was significantly increased and the concentrations were related to the severity of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Observation of families present in Labor Rooms has suggested that pre-eclamptic parturients are usually accompanied by a male companion while young parturients without pre-eclampsia are attended by a female family member. Consequently, 72 unselected teenage parturients were questioned about their sexual activity during pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia was diagnosed in 22; all had sexual activity after conception, 19 during the entire course of pregnancy and three during the first trimester only. Thirteen parturients who denied sexual activity during pregnancy did not develop pre-eclampsia. The remaining 37 parturients were sexually active but pre-eclampsia did not occur. The etiology of pre-eclampsia is enigmatic. The concept of a sexually-related origin provides possible explanations for the lack of the disease in animals as well as for certain facts about the disease in humans.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality but the etiology and pathogenesis are basically unknown. Pre-eclampsia is clearly associated to the placenta (trophoblast) alone. Epidemiological observations have raised one of the most popular hypotheses of the genesis of pre-eclampsia--an immune maladaptation between mother and foetus. Markedly raised incidences are seen in blood relatives (mothers, sisters, daughters) to pre-eclamptic women. In the genetic studies, the importance of specific combinations of mother-foetus-genotypes are recognized. The pathological processes involve an aberrant trophoblast-invasion of the spiral arteries, placental dysfunction, abnormal levels of cytokines and endothelial cell dysfunction, resulting in systemic and organ dysfunction. Genetic linkage studies and the use of molecular biology will probably elucidate the predisposing factors, etiology and pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia in more detail. There might be several pathways ending up with the same clinical manifestations.",preeclampsia
"Our report concerns the incidences of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in 147 sisters, 248 daughters, 74 granddaughters, and 131 daughters-in-law of women who have had eclampsia. The disorder is highly heritable. We have analysed the data in two ways, firstly, as a single gene condition and, secondly, as a multifactorial condition. The observed incidences fit closely with the single gene model with frequency of the putative gene being 0.25. When Falconer's method of estimating heritabilities of discrete characters is used, estimates of 120% (sisters), 88% (daughters), and 105% (granddaughters)--none significantly different from 100%-are obtained. Insofar as possible, our definition of pre-eclampsia corresponds with EPH in the descriptive classification of the Organisation Gestosis and to 'severe pre-eclampsia' in Nelson's classification. The women were delivered in many different hospitals, however, and many records fail to provide all of the essential information.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia complicates between 2 per cent and 8 per cent of pregnancies, and safe care for mother and baby depends on early recognition of signs and symptoms, as well as timely investigation and referral. An understanding of the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia is essential for the midwife as she is the practitioner most likely to recognise the disease as it presents. This article provides an overview of the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia, a summary of risk factors and an overview of laboratory tests that may be requested by the midwife. The article focuses on communication between the midwife and woman with an emphasis on holistic care.",preeclampsia
"Intervillous blood flow (IVBF) was measured by the 133Xe intravenous method before and after a 100 ml infusion of 20% human albumin in 13 cases of severe pre-eclampsia. In spite of the significant increase in serum albumin and colloid osmotic pressure values, no parallel direction of change in IVBF values could be seen to result from the immediate effects of volume expansion therapy. The results suggest that the use of albumin infusion is of no specific value in the treatment of severe pre-eclampsia in terms of evaluation at the level of placental circulation. The observation of an increase in placental blood flow in cases of real hypoalbuminemia calls for a further elucidation.",preeclampsia
"The relation of maternal blood group to pre-eclampsia has not been adequately studied in previous research. To investigate this relation, we conducted a case-control study of primigravidae. Data on 204 consecutive severely pre-eclamptic patients delivered pre-term and 744 controls were analysed using multivariate methods. After adjustment for the confounding effects of maternal age, social class, origin, education, pre-pregnancy weight and body mass index, and weight gain in pregnancy, we found an increased risk of pre-eclampsia for mothers with blood type AB (adjusted odds ratio = 3.07; 95% confidence interval 1.48-6.36). With respect to blood group O, A, B and Rh type, no statistically significant correlation with severe pre-eclampsia was found. Although these results should be considered with caution, they support the hypothesis of a linkage mechanism involving blood group in the inheritance of susceptibility to pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"To obtain some insight into the extracellular matrix in the human placenta, we investigated the composition of collagens purified from the placentae of patients with pre-eclampsia and compared it with normal placentae. Collagen was extracted from the placentae of both normal and pre-eclampsia pregnancies during the third trimester. The relative amounts of various collagens were evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The ratio of the intensity of the band corresponding to the alpha 1 (III) chain with that of the alpha 1 (I) chain in placentae of pre-eclampsia was significantly lower than in normal placentae (P < 0.05). In contrast, the ratio of the intensity of the band corresponding to the alpha 1 (V) chain with that of the alpha 1 (I) chain in placentae of pre-eclampsia was significantly higher than in normal placentae (P < 0.05). The results suggest that an increased level of type V collagen relative to type I collagen in the placentae of pre-eclampsia might be closely associated with the disturbance to trophoblastic cell functions and the supply of nutrients to the developing fetus necessary for the maintenance of pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a serious complication during pregnancy. It occurs after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The condition is defined by the following symptoms: hypertension, excess protein in the urine, oedema. The aim of this research is to determine the influence of age as risk factor for pre-eclampsia. The study was made at University Hospital-Pleven. Documentary method is used to collect information - medical history of patients. For the period of 2005/2010 the share of the hospitalized patients is relatively low, between 1,9-4,9% of the whole pathology The share of patients with pre-eclampsia after 30 years age is increasing.",preeclampsia
The early detection of pre-eclampsia is a major challenge in obstetric care. We report a case where pre-eclampsia was detected by home blood pressure monitoring between routine antenatal visits. This novel management approach allows early diagnosis and optimises antenatal care in fulminating disease.,preeclampsia
"The incidence of pre-eclampsia in 125 primigravidas who had previously received blood-transfusions was significantly less than in a matched series of controls--i.e., 12.8% compared with 23.2%. This suggests that immunological factors may be involved in the aetiology of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
A survey of 417 twin pregnancies is reported. Examination of the data revealed no difference in the incidence of pre-eclampsia referable to the zygosity of the twins. The findings thus lends no support to the hypothesis that immuno-incompatibility contributes to the aetiology of pre-eclampsia.,preeclampsia
"In 1982 Weinstein described the Hellp-Syndrome in pre-eclampsia. Two personal case histories have led the authors to discuss the need to specify this syndrome. Apart from the classical elements of pre-eclampsia, which are: arterial hypertension, proteinuria and oedema, there are bowel symptoms in 86% of cases and on the biological level there is thrombocytopenia and a rise in the transaminases as well as a haemolytic anaemia. Some cases of rupture of the liver have been described. Treatment is that of pre-eclampsia. This involves treatment with cortisone and sometimes with heparin. Delivery of the fetus is, however, the only really effective treatment. The characteristic three elements of the Hellp-Syndrome seem to be linked to disseminated intravascular coagulation and have long been considered very serious factors in pre-eclampsia. On the other hand it does seem to be useful for the clinician to know about the Hellp-syndrome in order to estimate the seriousness of a case where there are vasculo-renal elements in the syndrome and in order to avoid diagnosis mistakes in cases where the symptoms are often deceptive.",preeclampsia
"In pregnancy pre-eclampsia can be complicated by the nephrotic syndrome. We report on the clinical findings in 23 patients who had the nephrotic syndrome in pregnancy with hypertension. None of these patients had any previous sign of nephropathy. In most patients clinical signs first showed up in the 3rd trimester. The prognosis for the fetus was poor. This was because of the degree of proteinuria and of uraemia (5 fetuses died). After delivery all signs cleared up, as they would have done in moderately severe pre-eclampsia. All patients were considered to be cured by six months. In spite of this the longterm prognosis is difficult to assess. It is necessary to find out whether the nephrotic syndrome was evidence of an underlying nephropathy or just was due to the pre-eclampsia. Treatment consists mainly of rest, control of hypertension, correction of low blood volume and delivery of the fetus with regard to the degree of maturity and the viability of the fetus.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To determine the clinical delimitation and to investigate the difference of maternal and perinatal outcome with expectant management of women with early onset of severe preeclampsia. Methods: Two hundred and fifty-five cases meeting the criteria of severe pre-eclampsia who underwent expectant management were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into 4 groups: group A (n = 24) with onset before 28 weeks of gestation, group B (n = 50) with onset during 28 - 31 weeks of gestation, group C (n = 34) with onset during 32 - 33 gestational weeks, and group D (n = 147) with onset >or= 34 weeks of gestation. Main outcome measures included prolongation of gestation, perinatal mortality rate, and small for gestational age as well as major complications. Results: The average pregnancy prolongation was (9 +/- 3) days (range 1 to 40), (11 +/- 8) (range 1 to 28), (8 +/- 6) (range 1 to 21), and (5 +/- 4) (range 1 to 21), respectively in groups A, B, C and D. The gestational age at delivery was closely associated with the perinatal outcome. When a cut-off point was set at 34-week gestation, perinatal outcome was only associated with the gestational age at birth. If the cut-off point was set at 32-week gestation, perinatal morbidity and mortality were associated with both gestational age at birth and the onset of severe preeclampsia during pregnancy. Conclusions: The clinical delimitation of early onset of severe preeclampsia at 32-week gestation is significantly associated with poor maternal and perinatal outcome. Expectant management should be carried out in well-selected patients with severe preeclampsia remote from term, individually.",preeclampsia
"A great deal has been stated recently about the importance of hypovolemia in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia from the point of view of pathogenesis and management. Some authors even believe that the so-called hypovolemia represents an etiologic factor and should be ""corrected."" In this paper, the hemodynamic factors that maintain the circulation in the normal nonpregnant and pregnant states are discussed. These factors are then used as a background for explaining the pathophysiologic abnormalities of the acute hypertensive disease of pregnancy. It is concluded that the slight decrease in blood volume observed in pre-eclampsia has no hemodynamic relevance; the blood volume is merely ""fitting"" a contracted vascular bed. The major abnormality resides in the constricted arteriolar system and not in the blood volume.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a potential hazard to both mother and fetus. Clinical features alone give a poor indication of the significance or severity of the condition. Investigations which indicate the extent of multisystem maternal changes help to distinguish pre-eclampsia from other hypertensive disorders and help to assess the need for, and timing of intervention. Serial assessments of sensitive indicators such as proteinuria, platelet counts and serum urate are more helpful than single measurements. Full ultrasound biophysical profiles of the fetus are desirable in the presence of severe pre-eclampsia, but when this sophisticated examination is not available much can be learned from ultrasound estimates of fetal growth, liquor volume and from cardiotocography.",preeclampsia
Pre-eclampsia and 'essential' hypertension in pregnancy require to be studied separately. Their haemodynamic characteristics need to be determined and the effects of antihypertensive therapy and blood volume expansion explored. Diuretics should be used in pre-eclampsia only to treat cardiac failure. Hydrallazine may be contraindicated if cardiac failure is imminent. The role of propranolol remains undecided and a controlled trial is required. Studies of the renin-angiotensin system which take into account the various factors that alter renin secretion may prove useful.,preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is still a condition which worldwide kills many mothers and is the cause of a great number of perinatal deaths and one of the leading causes of perinatal morbidity even in developed countries. The definition of pre-eclampsia still varies in the literature, thus making the comparison of results difficult and the issue obscure. Nevertheless, recent advances in research into the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia has greatly enhanced our understanding of his condition. Therefore, new strategies to predict and prevent this disorder are sought for and emerging.",preeclampsia
A case of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia appearing in three generations is presented combined with a review of literature. It is unknown whether the maternal genotype or the combination of the fetal and the maternal genotype is responsible for a disposition to this disease. Moreover the heredity as an autosomal-recessive or a dominant one with incomplete penetrance is in dispute. Further investigation will be convenient to improve the definition of groups at risk and a possible pharmacological prophylaxis.,preeclampsia
"The Fourth International Workshop on 'Reproductive Immunology, Immunological Tolerance and Immunology of Pre-eclampsia' was held in the Island of La Reunion in December 2004. Besides intense sharing of immunological data, it included also epidemiological studies from South Africa, USA and Australia, as well as genetic studies from South Africa and Mauritius, discussions on the future of graft transplant tolerance, implications of inositol-phosphoglycans in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia (PE), pathways to the inflammatory syndrome and other topics. Participants shared the belief that we may be witnessing significant steps forward in our comprehension of PE as an immunological event, with a prominent role for deregulation of the innate immune system, probably controlled by T cells and cytokine networks at the feto-placental interface. There was a growing consensus for an NK cell (KIR)-dependent event, with regulation exerted by T cells, as well as an important role for HLA-C presentation/recognition and HLA-G in mediating inflammatory cytokine imbalance, with an emphasis on IL-12 and IL-16 It is hoped that the next Workshop in 2006 will prove the immune involvement by dissecting the NK/Treg/Ts cell and HLA-CI HLA-G circuits leading to cytokine and vascular dysfunction.",preeclampsia
Severe pre-eclampsia leading to fetal death in advanced abdominal pregnancy is reported. Attention is drawn to the low reported incidence of pre-eclampsia in this condition and possible explanations are put forward.,preeclampsia
"An investigation was done to clarify the pathological background of pre-eclampsia. Thirty four placentae were studied immunopathologically in comparison to control cases. The results showed slightly positive stains of hCG containing alpha- and beta-subunits in syncytiocytotrophoblastic layers especially in severe pre-eclampsia cases. The placentae in mild pre-eclampsia showed only weakly and partly positive by those stains. Other control cases were negative except earlier abortion ones. No any positive stains of hCG series could be seen in two placentas from mothers with spontaneous hypertension. Stains by hPL and SP 1 were all positive and increased gradually in their staining pattern and degree from early pregnancy toward term. It supports the findings that maternal serum hCG series increased slightly in pre-eclampsia and that those changes might occur before clinical onset of pre-eclampsia. Then, the placenta has an important role in developing pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Studying 30 pregnant women, 26 resulted in a pre-eclampsia and 4 in a fetal intrauterine growth retardation. The patients were treated with 500 ml low molecular dextran per hour. We found a hemodilution, an increase of plasma viscosity (5.4%), and a raised cardiac output (32.4%). Resulting from the increased cardiac output we saw a raised systemic oxygen transport capacity in contrast to the hemodilution. The hemodilution is characterized by the increase in stroke volume, whereas heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure are remaining unchanged. The erythrocyte aggregation fell (32.4%) and colloid osmotic pressure raised (27%). Watching the clinical course, we observed a prolongation of gestation above 14 days in ten patients with pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation. One intrauterine death had to be noticed. The data suggest that only an early infusion therapy with low molecular colloids can be successful in the treatment of hemorheological disorders in pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders (and especially preeclampsia) remain nowadays the major problem of human reproduction as it occurs in at least 10% of all world population births. It is a major cause of maternal-fetal mortality and morbidity in developed and developing countries. This disease was until recently classically considered as a disease of primigravidas with little recurrence in multigravidas. Nevertheless, recent evidences in the last half decade suggest that this disease is indeed a disease of first pregnancies, but at the level of a couple (primipaternity) rather than only the mother's side (primigravidity). Therefore, multigravidas share the risk with primigravidas in case of conception with a new partner. We expose the biological plausibility of this new approach (immunogenetic factors), and propose its epidemiological consequences with proposals of future research for health workers or demographers working at the level of populations. If pregnancy-induced disorders are disease of new couples, then their patterns are probably very different according to the broad reproductive patterns existing among different cultures (contraception, matrifocality or patrifocality, age at marriage, changes of reproductive partners et cetera).",preeclampsia
"Once a woman with pre-eclampsia has been referred for obstetric care, the midwife's role is to: Provide continuity of midwifery care. Advise the woman and her partner on what to expect, without frightening them. Interpret the doctor's information where necessary. Arrange a visit to the special care baby unit if appropriate. Monitor both the woman and the fetus and act on any signs that show a deterioration in their condition.",preeclampsia
"Changes were recorded in central and periphery haemodynamic indices during the uncomplicated pregnancy, at the onset of preeclampsia, and postpartum, in the relevant studies made. The following three cardiodynamic phase syndromes were found to be developing through stages during physiological pregnancy against the background of hypervolemia: volume loading under 22 to 24 weeks, hyperdynamic state at 28 to 32 weeks, and hypodynamic one antepartum. Preeclampsia is associated with changeable haemodynamic indices, which fact is chiefly hypervolemia-related. The pump function of the heart becomes inadequate and the cardiodynamic phase syndrome of high diastolic pressure in noted to be developing. Early significant indices for preeclampsia have been determined characterizing the latent blood circulation deficiency in the preclinical stage. This warrants the use of a non-invasive method, such as, for instance, tetrapolar bioimpedance integral rheography for a complex programme of prophylaxis and treatment of preeclampsia to be instituted.",preeclampsia
"Our objective was to assess the levels of nitric oxide (NO) in pre-eclampsia and to investigate its effect on blood pressure (BP) in the Jamaican population. A total of 103 participants (50 pre-eclampsia, 53 controls) were recruited from the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI). Blood samples were collected in the fasting state and trimester BP measurements were obtained from their records. A commercially available kit supplied by Oxford Biomedical Research Inc. (MI, USA) was used to measure plasma levels of NO. All measures of booking BP were significantly higher in women who later developed pre-eclampsia compared with those whose pregnancies remained normotensive (p </= 0.004). Mean plasma nitrite (NO) levels in the cases was 21.9 +/- 5.4 micromol/L (n = 48), significantly higher than that of the controls, 19.2 +/- 5.7 micromol/L (n = 52) p = 0.015. NO levels were not directly associated with the level of BP, p > 0.05. We concluded that in the Jamaican population, booking BP measurements may be predictors of pre-eclampsia and NO production increases in pre-eclampsia but is not related to the height of the BP.",preeclampsia
"During an eight year period, 100 patients with the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome were treated at the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of 2 University Hospitals (Technische Universität München and Universität Göttingen). The clinical treatment concepts, which were used in common at the two hospitals, are presented and differ from the common clinical management of pre-eclampsia. The results and therapy concepts are compared and critically reviewed. In recent years, the number of diagnoses and cases of HELLP syndrome has been increasing. Case reports, epidemiological statistics and maternal and perinatal mortality rates indicate a change of the ""Gestalt"" of preeclampsia due to the HELLP syndrome and its complications.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia (PE) and eclampsia is the leading cause of maternal death in the UK and a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. PE is predominantly a disorder of first pregnancy. There is a genetic component. PE is a syndrome without a defined cause. The variability with which it presents, and the speed with which it progresses, make it hard to diagnose. High blood pressure and proteinuria, with or without oedema, are classic symptoms but it may also present in an unusual way, eg as jaundice; as proteinuria with normal blood pressure; as intra-uterine growth retardation; as abdominal pain. The placenta becomes ""sick"" because of restricted blood flow from the mother; an unknown factor causes disturbances to spread throughout the mother's circulation which may lead to blindness, strokes, liver rupture and death. Delivery of the placenta is the only effective treatment, but preventive options being explored include aspirin and calcium supplements.",preeclampsia
"Three women will with pre-existing renal disease developed severe pre-eclampsia with renal failure during the midtrimester of pregnancy. Plasma exchange was commenced at 23, 26 and 29 weeks of gestation and continued, initially daily then second daily, until delivery at 32, 29 and 32 weeks, respectively. During this period, signs of pre-eclampsia regressed and renal function stabilised or improved. One baby with severe hyaline membrane disease died at 6 days; the other 2, now aged 7 months and 4 months, are in good health. Plasma exchange may offer an alternative to termination of pregnancy in the management of patients with severe pre-eclampsia when fetal maturity is insufficient for viability.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To outline the maternal and perinatal features and outcome of patients referred to a tertiary referral obstetric hospital for management of their hypertension. Setting and patients: 205 consecutive public patients admitted for assessment of hypertension (either full admission or day-stay) to King George V Hospital's Hypertension in Pregnancy Unit, between February 1993 and January 1994. Design: A prospective study in which patients were classified according to the Australasian Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ASSHP) Consensus Statement classification. Results: Of the 205 patients, 25% did not meet the criteria for pre-eclampsia or chronic hypertension, 33% had mild pre-eclampsia, 34% had severe pre-eclampsia and the remainder had chronic hypertension. The mean gestation at delivery for those with mild pre-eclampsia was 38.3 weeks and for severe pre-eclampsia 35.3 weeks. For the mild and severe groups respectively, the rate of elective delivery for raised blood pressure was 56% and 53%; for caesarean section, 17% and 61%; and for perinatal death, 2% and 4%. In the severe group, 49% had fetal problems and 25% required intravenous antihypertensives. Conclusions: The multisystem nature of pre-eclampsia makes comparison of management protocols difficult. Ongoing audit is needed of maternal and perinatal outcomes and features of disease in patients with hypertension in pregnancy under a universal classification. The ASSHP classification system successfully identifies patients who require more intensive management and intervention.",preeclampsia
"The plasma levels of heparin cofactor II were determined in pregnant women who were either normotensive, or had essential hypertension, gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia during the third trimester and 72 h after delivery. Heparin cofactor II levels in the pre-eclampsia group were depressed. The clinical relevance of this finding is the potential utility of heparin cofactor II plasma levels in the differential diagnostic between non-proteinuric hypertension and pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a severe form of hypertension induced by pregnancy. In pre-eclampsia, there is deficient trophoblast invasion of the spiral arteries terminating in the placental bed. Perhaps some abnormality occurs in the immunosuppressive process as the maternal immune system encounters paternal antigens expressed by immunosuppressive decidual cells. This immunosuppressive abnormality might cause the deficient trophoblast invasion. Abnormal placentation might then lead to maternal endothelial cell damage by an ongoing process. There might be a recurring sequence of 4 steps: (1) The placenta releases trophoblastic cells with potentially cytotoxic characteristics. These circulating trophoblastic cells have an abnormal pattern of expression of integrins and perhaps other glycoproteins or proteins. (2) The circulating trophoblastic cells loosely bind to maternal endothelial cells, targeting them for anti-tumourigenesis. (3) The maternal immune system reacts against targeted maternal endothelial cells through anti-tumourigenic mechanisms. (4) Widespread maternal endothelial damage causes the characteristic kidney lesion called glomerula endotheliosis.",preeclampsia
"The prospective study involved 183 pregnant women with disorders of the thyroid gland, who were regularly followed up and delivered at the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, University Clinical Centre, Belgrade, over a period of 10 years (1981-1990). There were 15 euthyroid patients in whom development of pre-eclampsia was diagnosed in the last trimester of pregnancy, and 20 healthy pregnant women with normal pregnancies and termed deliveries. The incidence of pre-eclampsia was analyzed depending on the basic disease, therapy and pregnancy metabolic status, as well as on their influence on the function. A statistically significant higher incidence of pre-eclampsia (p < 0.001) was observed in pregnant women with hyperthyroidism (26.0%) and hypothyroidism (26.8%). On the other hand, in euthyroid patients with pre-eclampsia the authors found that the concentration of total and free thyroxine was somewhat lower, while that of thyroid-stimulating hormone was a little higher comparing to the healthy pregnant women in the last trimester of pregnancy. Similar changes were noticed in patients with hypothyroidism. In pregnant women with hyperthyroidism and pre-eclampsia it was established that the concentration of thyroxine and triiodothyronine was somewhat higher, and that concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone was a little lower comparing to all examined women in the equal metabolic condition. In the authors' opinion diseases of the thyroid gland represent a predisposing factor, i.e. a risk factor for the development of pre-eclampsia. The aim of further investigation is to observe mutual influences, pathogenetic mechanisms of further development of pre-eclampsia in patients with thyroid disorders, i. e. the influence of pre-eclampsia on thyroid disorders.",preeclampsia
"Although the aetiology of pre-eclampsia is unknown, haemodynamic studies suggest that many of the clinical findings may be explained by a generalised vasoconstrictive disorder and abnormal endothelial cell function. Vasoconstriction may be attributed to the increased concentrations of haemoglobin found in pre-eclampsia compared with normal pregnancy. Free haemoglobin may be derived from haemolysis and placental haemorrhage and, at concentrations known to be present in pre-eclampsia, vasodilatation mediated by endothelium-derived relaxing factor is inhibited. Infusion of oxyhaemoglobin into human coronary arteries inhibits acetylcholine-induced vasodilatation. We suggest that an increased free haemoglobin concentration is the cause of vasoconstriction in pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To assess the effectiveness of second trimester 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement as a screening test for pre-eclampsia. Design: Prospective interventional study. Setting: John Radcliffe Maternity Hospital, Oxford, and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London. Subjects: One hundred and sixty-two normotensive nulliparous women recruited at hospital booking clinics. Intervention: Ambulatory blood pressure was measured at 18 and 28 weeks gestation using the TM2420 monitor. Main outcome measure: The development of pre-eclampsia. Results: Awake systolic and mean arterial pressures were significantly increased (P < 0.02) at 18 weeks in those who later developed pre-eclampsia. Those differences were more apparent at 28 weeks at which time the diastolic pressure was also increased (P < 0.01). At both stages of gestation the higher readings were sustained during sleep so that the awake-sleep differences were similar in relation to each outcome. The group with incipient pre-eclampsia had a significantly faster heart rate at both 18 and 28 weeks (P < 0.002) The sensitivity in predicting pre-eclampsia for a mean arterial pressure of 85 mmHg or greater at 28 weeks was 65%, with a positive predictive value of 31%. The sensitivity and positive predictive value for a test combining a mean arterial pressure of 85 mmHg or greater and a heart rate of 90 bpm or greater were 53% and 45%, respectively. Conclusion: Although second trimester ambulatory blood pressure is significantly increased in women who later develop pre-eclampsia, the predictive values for blood pressure alone are low. The efficiency of the test is increased by combining the awake ambulatory heart rate and blood pressure measurement together. If an effective method for preventing pre-eclampsia becomes available (commencing at 28 weeks gestation), then awake ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate may have some clinical value as a screening test.",preeclampsia
"In a prospective study we found a hypertonic disease in 5.26% of the pregnant women. The course of pregnancy and delivery in women with chronic hypertension (22.1%) and in women with a pregnancy hypertension (53.3%) was without complications; delivery of eutrophic children was on term. Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia (19.7%) had an early birth of dystrophic, retarded children (below the 10th percentile). The acidosis morbidity (36.4%) and the frequency of Caesarean section (79.2%) were significantly increased compared to other hypertension types. More often we found pathological para-clinical changes. The perinatal mortality occurred in women with pre-eclampsia in 10.4%. It was not increased in all other hypertension types. The emphasis in prepartal monitoring should be on women suffering from pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Fifty patients with severe pre-eclampsia who presented before 32 weeks' gestation were managed conservatively (sedation, bed rest, antihypertensive therapy and intensive fetal and maternal monitoring) until intervention was indicated. Twelve patients presented before 26 weeks of pregnancy and there were no fetal survivors in this group; 23 presented between 26 and 29 weeks and 8(34,8%) of the babies in this group survived. The rate of perinatal loss in those presenting between 30 and 32 weeks was 26,6% (N = 4). Patients who had a history of a hypertensive disorder in their previous pregnancy(ies) had a higher perinatal mortality rate; 23 such mothers experienced 16 perinatal losses compared with 27 mothers who had no such history and who had only 8 perinatal losses. There was 1 maternal death, there were 2 cases of eclampsia, 3 of pulmonary oedema, 4 of abruptio placentae and 1 case of renal failure; 2 patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation. The local indigent and underprivileged black population have a more aggressive form of early onset of severe pre-eclampsia than that reported for other population groups. The high maternal complication rate of 30,8% and the low fetal survival rate before 26 weeks indicate that there is no place in our setting for expectant management of severe pre-eclampsia in patients presenting before 26 weeks. This applies particularly to those with a previous history of hypertension in pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"During the period 1.1.1986-31.12.1988, the number of patients with severe preeclampsia referred to the intensive care unit in Sønderborg Hospital increased. On the basis of a retrospective study of the hospital records, possible reasons and certain characteristics of this increase are pointed out. Failure of treatment of severe hypertension and oliguria were the most frequent reasons for referral. Respiratory complications predominated: four women had pulmonary oedema and eight required ventilatory support. Despite difficulties in assessing the haemodynamic status, these nineteen cases appear to illustrate the unpredictable variation in severe preeclampsia per se. Insufficient volume expansion may explain a few episodes of oliguria, but neither excessive volume expansion nor unacceptable delay in observation appear to offer plausible explanations for the increase observed. The authors conclude that the frequency of haemodynamic complications in this analysis illustrated the potentially disastrous effect of preeclampsia in itself. Early delivery should always be considered in patients with even minor symptoms of treatment failure, regardless of the age of gestation. Should haemodynamic complications occur despite this, referral to an intensive care unit should be considered.",preeclampsia
"A total of 92 pregnant women with late gestoses were examined, inclusive of 25 (27.2%) women presenting with hydrops, 64 (69.6%) with a first-to-third degree nephropathy, 3 (3.3%) with preeclampsia. All the examinees revealed clear-cut disorders of the immune homeostasis and microcirculation that tended to be more pronounced in a third-degree nephropathy and preeclampsia. Correlation was established between parameters characterizing immunity and microhaemodynamic indexes, which fact suggests community of their pathogeneses.",preeclampsia
"The ""Hellp syndrome"" describes the association of three biological abnormalities (hemolysis, liver abnormalities and thrombocytopenia) establishing the severity of arterial hypertension during pregnancy and requiring the interruption of pregnancy as much for the child as for the mother. This article reports a case of ""Hellp syndrome"" which was special in that the biological abnormalities preceded the occurrence of pre-eclampsia. The signs, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of the ""Hellp syndrome"" are studied in this article.",preeclampsia
"Plasma endothelin levels were studied in 29 pregnancies. Levels were found to be increased in 9 pregnancies complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease and/or pre-eclampsia as compared to levels in 14 normotensive pregnancies with gestational age varying between 24-40 weeks with normal Doppler flow velocity waveforms of the uterine arcuate arteries, and 6 normotensive pregnancies with abnormal Doppler flow velocity waveforms at 24 weeks' gestation. Two patients with severe pre-eclampsia showed a rise in plasma endothelin levels, suggesting a correlation between plasma endothelin levels and the disease process. Endothelin is produced by endothelial cells of blood vessels; it is the most potent vasoconstrictor known to date. For this reason it has been suggested that endothelin might be important in the control of systemic blood pressure and local blood flow, both disturbed in pre-eclampsia. The conclusion of this study is that the venous plasma level of endothelin would seem to be a marker for severe disease, however, without any predictive value.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia and eclampsia are very important health problems because they are the main contributors to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. These disorders are unique in pregnancy and are characterized by oedema, proteinuria and hypertension. they occur in 0.5% to 30% of all pregnancies, primarily in primigravidas, after the 20-th week of gestation. Preeclampsia and eclampsia are diseases of undetermined cause. Many different factors might play an important role in the development of these diseases. One of them is nutrition. Recent studies have emphasized the possible role of general nutritional deficiency or imbalance of several specific nutrients in the aetiology of the disease. Deficiency of a variety of nutrients has been reported in patients with preeclampsia. The obtained results are contradictory and further study is necessary. Nevertheless, some evidence is highly suggestive of a relationship between nutritional status and the onset or progress of the disease. The article reviews the study that correlates the role of several nutritional elements with the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and eclampsia: proteins, lipids, calcium, vitamin D, sodium, magnesium and zinc. The evidence that supports or rejects the role of each of these nutrients is presented. In this way a guideline for general nutritional counseling in the prenatal period that will promote a healthier pregnancy, is offered.",preeclampsia
"Pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia account for about 25% of perinatal morbidity and mortality and are a leading cause of maternal death in developed countries. Consequently, early diagnosis of the disease seems very important. Numerous clinical and biochemical methods have been described and tested for the prediction of preeclampsia. The results of these studies are critically described here. In summary, no test presently available serve as a reliable early marker of developing preeclampsia. However, vaginal Dopplerultrasound may allow prediction as early as the 12th to 16th week of gestation. Moreover, methods detecting underlying mechanisms of the disease such as endothelial dysfunction and platelet activation, are being developed and might provide improved early identification of pregnant women at high risk.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To evaluate the maternal and fetal effects of three anesthetic methods used randomly in women with severe preeclampsia who required cesarean delivery. Methods: Eighty women with severe preeclampsia, who were to be delivered by cesarean, were randomized to general (26 women), epidural (27), or combined spinal-epidural (27) anesthesia. The mean preoperative blood pressure (BP) was approximately 170/110 mmHg, and all women had proteinuria. Anesthetic and obstetric management included antihypertensive drug therapy and limited intravenous (IV) fluid and drug therapy. Results: The mean gestational age at delivery was 34.8 weeks. All infants were born in good condition as assessed by Apgar scores and umbilical arterial blood gas determinations. Maternal hypotension resulting from regional anesthesia was managed without excessive IV fluid administration. Similarly, maternal BP was managed without severe hypertensive effects in women undergoing general anesthesia. There were no serious maternal or fetal complications attributable to any of the three anesthetic methods. Conclusion: General as well as regional anesthetic methods are equally acceptable for cesarean delivery in pregnancies complicated by severe preeclampsia if steps are taken to ensure a careful approach to either method.",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia is associated with several complications. Early prediction of complications and timely management is needed for clinical care of these patients to avert fetal and maternal mortality and morbidity. There is a need to identify best testing strategies in pre eclampsia to identify the women at increased risk of complications. We aim to determine the accuracy of various tests to predict complications of pre-eclampsia by systematic quantitative reviews. Method: We performed extensive search in MEDLINE (1951-2004), EMBASE (1974-2004) and also will also include manual searches of bibliographies of primary and review articles. An initial search has revealed 19500 citations. Two reviewers will independently select studies and extract data on study characteristics, quality and accuracy. Accuracy data will be used to construct 2 x 2 tables. Data synthesis will involve assessment for heterogeneity and appropriately pooling of results to produce summary Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve and summary likelihood ratios. Discussion: This review will generate predictive information and integrate that with therapeutic effectiveness to determine the absolute benefit and harm of available therapy in reducing complications in women with pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia are rare, but potentially life-threatening conditions that emergency physicians must be able to diagnose and treat promptly, because initial presentations to the ED are real possibilities. The treatment of the major complications of this disorder, hypertension and seizures, have been the focus of much research. Magnesium sulphate is now the first line agent for acute treatment and prophylaxis of seizures in eclampsia and pre-eclampsia. Severe pre-eclampsia should be treated with magnesium to prevent progression to eclampsia. Severe hypertension requires treatment with an intravenous antihypertensive agent familiar to the clinician. No single antihypertensive has been proven to be better than another, although in Australia, hydralazine is probably the initial intravenous agent of choice. Routine use of invasive haemodynamic monitoring and volume expansion is not recommended and consultation with obstetric colleagues is essential.",preeclampsia
"The desired goal in the management of patients with pre-eclampsia is safety of the mother first and then delivery of a live mature newborn that will not require intensive and prolonged neonatal care. Initial management includes maternal hospitalization for evaluation of maternal and fetal conditions. Subsequent management is individualized based on the above evaluation and fetal gestational age. Expectant management results in good pregnancy outcome in most patients with mild disease remote from term. For patients with severe disease, the success rate of expectant management will depend on both fetal gestational age and maternal and fetal conditions at time of hospitalization. In general, maternal and perinatal complications are significantly increased in patients with severe disease prior to 34 weeks' gestation and in those with HELLP syndrome. Thus, these patients should be managed only at regional hospitals with adequate maternal and neonatal intensive care facilities. Finally, patients with pre-eclampsia are at increased risk for recurrence of pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancies.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is associated with a number of changes to maternal vascular function. Assessment of arterial stiffness using pulse wave analysis (PWA) has been proposed as a means of predicting preeclampsia before the onset of clinically detectable disease. One hundred and eighty women with 2 risk factors for preeclampsia were examined at gestational weeks 16 and 28, of whom 17 (9.4%) developed preeclampsia. To study the effects of pregnancy itself women were also examined at 6-9 months post-natally; an additional 30 healthy non-pregnant women were also examined. PWA was performed using SphygmoCor; augmentation index (AIx), a marker of arterial wave reflection, was also measured using EndoPAT-2000. Women who developed preeclampsia were more likely to be overweight and had a higher brachial and central diastolic BP at gestational week 16 than those who remained normotensive. There was no difference in any parameter of arterial wave reflection between non-pregnant and pregnant women, nor between those who developed preeclampsia and those who remained normotensive, when examined at weeks 16 and 28 or post-natally. In this cohort of women with risk factors for preeclampsia, PWA did not provide additional information beyond brachial blood pressure and maternal risk factor profile about the risk of future development of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder that complicates 3-8% of pregnancies in the Western world, and is a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although it is a disease unique to pregnancy, evidence has mounted in recent years that preeclampsia has important implications for future maternal health, in particular cardiovascular health. In this review we examine epidemiological evidence for this relationship, and examine potential mechanisms such as insulin resistance, genetic factors and endothelial dysfunction that may explain the relationship. In addition we explore potential future avenues of research into the field, such as genomics, proteomics and metabolomics.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive disorders are the most common medical complications of pregnancy and are an important cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. The author presents a review on Hypertension in pregnancy from the point of view of classification, diagnosis and treatment. According to JNC 6 and WHO/ISH recommendations hypertensive disorders of pregnancy can be divided into three categories: 1. chronic hypertension, 2. transient hypertension, 3. preeclampsia; preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. (Tab. 3, Ref. 23.)",preeclampsia
"During healthy pregnancy, the cardiovascular system undergoes diverse adaptations to support adequate transfer of oxygen and nutrients from mother to fetus. In order to accommodate the large expansion of blood volume and associated cardiac output, the structure, mechanics, and function of the arteries are altered. Specifically, in healthy pregnancy there is a remodeling of arteries (increased angiogenesis and vasodilation), a generalized reduction in arterial stiffness (increased compliance), and an enhanced endothelial function. The development of pregnancy complications, specifically pre-eclampsia, is associated with poor placentation (decreased angiogenesis), increased arterial stiffness, and vascular dysfunction (reduced endothelial function). Many of the positive adaptations that occur in healthy pregnancy are enhanced in response to chronic exercise. Specifically, placental angiogenesis and endothelial function have been shown to improve to a greater extent in women who are active during their pregnancy compared with those who are not. Prenatal exercise may be important in helping to reduce the risk of vascular dysfunction in pregnancy. However, our knowledge of the vascular adaptations resulting from maternal exercise is limited. This review highlights maternal vascular adaptations occurring during healthy pregnancy, and contrasts the vascular maladaptation associated with pre-eclampsia. Finally, we discuss the role of prenatal exercise on vascular function in the potential prevention of vascular complications associated with pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia and placental causes of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are part of the same spectrum of disorders. In IUGR, there is preferential shunting of blood to the fetal brain at the expense of other organs. We wanted to demonstrate that this also occurs in pre-eclampsia using three dimensional (3D) ultrasound. The 3D indices of perfusion are: flow index (FI), vascular index (VI) and vascularisation flow index (VFI) which reflect tissue vascularity and flow intensity. Methods: Fourteen normal pregnant women and 14 with diagnosed pre-eclampsia were recruited. Scanning was conducted by 2 observers using a Voluson E8 machine. Perfusion was measured at a pre-defined position within the fetal brain and fetal liver. The power Doppler signals were quantified using the 'histogram facility' to generate 3 indices of vascularity: FI, VI and VFI. The unpaired t-test was used to compare differences between groups. The hypothesis was that fetal brain FI, VI and VFI would be similar between women with normal pregnancy and women with pre-eclampsia, but measurements would be reduced in the fetal liver in women with pre-eclampsia. Results: Maternal characteristics of age, body mass index and gestation were not different between groups. The depth of insonnation did not differ between groups. Fetal cerebral perfusion was not different between women with a normal pregnancy compared to women with pre-eclampsia. The mean (SD) for FI was 22.4 (5.7) vs. 21.1 (4.3) respectively (p=0.49). For VI, the mean (SD) was as 64.7 (40.4) vs. 79.1 (27.4) respectively (p=0.28). For VFI, the mean (SD) was 14.8 (10.3) vs. 16.1 (5.5) respectively (p = 0.66). Fetal hepatic perfusion was not different between women with a normal pregnancy compared to women with pre-eclampsia. The mean (SD) for FI was 34.4 (19.9) vs. 27.8 (11.0) respectively (p = 0.28). For VI, mean (SD) was 67.6 (36.0) vs. 87.3 (25.8) respectively (p=0.11). For VFI, the mean (SD) was 19.6 (11.6) vs. 23.1 (10.6) respectively (p=0.42). Conclusion: Using 3D ultrasound, we were not able to demonstrate preferential shunting of blood to the fetal brain at the expense of the fetal liver. Due to the high variability of our data, no definite conclusions can be derived from this work. A larger study may be required.",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Early prediction of pre-eclampsia may be used to target high-risk women for effective preventative treatments. Hyperuricemia is associated with pre-eclampsia and it has been tested in early pregnancy for its ability to predict the later onset of the disease. Objective: To systematically review the accuracy of determining serum uric acid before the 25th gestational week in predicting pre-eclampsia. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Medion, bibliographies of review articles and eligible primary studies, and contacted experts in the field. Language restrictions were not applied. Reviewers working independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed validity according to eight criteria. Sensitivities and specificities were plotted in a Receiver Operating Characteristic plot. Results: We identified five primary articles, with a total of 572 women, including 44 who developed pre-eclampsia. Study populations differed clinically, with incidences ranging from 3.4% to 40.1%. Sensitivity ranged from 0.0% to 55.6% and specificity ranged from 76.9% to 94.9%. Clinical heterogeneity and poor reporting precluded sensible pooling of data. In particular, consecutive entry of eligible women, blind assessment of the reference standard, and treatment to prevent pre-eclampsia were poorly reported. Conclusion: Contrary to previous reviews, we conclude that there is currently insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the accuracy of serum uric acid determination in predicting pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating disorder of pregnancy that affects up to 8% of pregnant women in the United States. The diagnosis of PE is made by the presentation of new-onset hypertension, ≥140 mmHg systolic blood pressure (BP) or ≥90 mmHg diastolic BP, and either proteinuria or another accompanying sign/symptom, such as renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, pulmonary edema, or cerebral/visual. These signs can occur suddenly and without warning. PE that presents before 34 wk of gestation is considered early onset and carries a greater risk for perinatal morbidity/mortality than late-onset PE that occurs at or after 34 wk of gestation. At this time there is no cure for PE, and the only effective treatment is delivery of the baby and placenta. If allowed to progress to eclampsia (PE with neurologic involvement), seizures will occur and possibly death through stroke. PE also carries the risk of significant fetal and neonatal morbidity/mortality in addition to long-term health risks for mother and child. Despite significant research efforts to accurately predict, diagnose, and treat PE, a cure eludes us. Elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms that can cause PE will aid in our ability to accurately prevent, manage, and treat PE to avoid maternal and fetal losses. Intense research efforts are focused on PE, and the mouse has proven to be a useful animal model for investigating molecular mechanisms that may hold the key to unraveling the mysteries of PE in women.",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia shares pathophysiology with intrauterine growth restriction. Objective: To investigate whether delivery of a small for gestational age (SGA) infant in the 1st pregnancy increases the risk of early and late onset pre-eclampsia in the 2nd pregnancy. Conversely, we investigated whether pre-eclampsia in the 1st pregnancy impacts SGA risk in the 2nd pregnancy. Study design: We studied a cohort from the Dutch Perinatal Registry of 265,031 women with 1st and 2nd singleton pregnancies who delivered between 2000 and 2007. We analyzed 2nd pregnancy risks of early and late onset pre-eclampsia-defined by delivery before or after 34 gestational weeks-as well as SGA below the 5th and between the 5th and 10th percentiles risks with multivariable logistic regressions. Interaction terms between 1st pregnancy hypertension, pre-eclampsia, SGA, and delivery before or after 34 gestational weeks were included in the regressions. Results: First pregnancy early onset pre-eclampsia increased risk of SGA <5th percentile (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.7-2.7) in the 2nd pregnancy. Late onset pre-eclampsia increased the SGA <5th percentile marginally (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.3). In the absence of 1st pregnancy hypertensive disorder, women who delivered an SGA infant in their 1st pregnancy were at increased risk of 2nd pregnancy late onset pre-eclampsia (SGA <5th: OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.58-2.66; SGA 5-10th: OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.01-1.93). Early onset 2nd pregnancy pre-eclampsia risk was also increased, but this was only statistically significant for women who delivered an SGA infant below the 5th percentile in the 1st pregnancy (SGA <5th: OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.19-5.00; SGA 5-10th: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.68-4.24;). Conclusion: Women with 1st pregnancy early onset pre-eclampsia have increased risk of SGA <5th percentile in the 2nd pregnancy. SGA in the 1st pregnancy increases pre-eclampsia risk in the 2nd pregnancy even in the absence of hypertensive disorders in the 1st pregnancy, although absolute risks remain low. These findings strengthen the evidence base associating intrauterine growth restriction with early onset pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: To investigate the use of colour flow Doppler ultrasound to identify retinal blood vessels in women with mild pre-eclampsia and to assess the effects of an infusion of magnesium sulphate on the baseline retinal blood flow-velocity. Design: Prospective descriptive study. Setting: Ben Taub Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA. Subjects: Eight women with mild pre-eclampsia. Interventions: Baseline colour flow Doppler ultrasound assessment of the central retinal artery (CRA) and posterior ciliary artery (PCA) blood flow-velocity before intravenous infusion of 6 g of magnesium sulphate in 100 ml of 5% dextrose water over 20 min, followed by repeat Doppler measurement. Main outcome measures: Blood pressure, heart rate, pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), angle-corrected flow-velocity (cm/s). Results: The CRA and PCA were easily and reliably identified. The infusion of 6 g of magnesium sulphate significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the mean CRA PI from 1.42 (SD 0.67) to 0.93 (SD 0.18) and the mean CRA RI (P < 0.008) from 0.62 (SD 0.07) to 0.53 (SD 0.10). The PCA PI decreased (P = 0.01) from 0.97 SD (0.14) to 0.78 SD (0.18) and the PCA RI decreased (P = 0.02) from 0.58 SD (0.07) to 0.48 SD (0.09). Angle-corrected flow-velocity decreased non-significantly after the magnesium sulphate infusion. Conclusions: Patients with pre-eclampsia have high CRA and PCA flow-velocity suggestive of vasospasm. Magnesium sulphate acutely vasodilates the small arteries in the retina, increasing retinal blood flow. Changes in the blood flow in the retina may be indicative of similar changes in other end-arterial branches of the internal carotid artery. This non-invasive Doppler method may provide a means to monitor the effects of therapeutic interventions in patients with pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"While it is generally accepted that preeclampsia is a disease of the microvasculature characterized by an imbalance between prostacyclin and thromboxane and that the evidence for enhanced responsiveness to some vasopressors is present weeks before clinical disease, the specific cause of the hypertension characterizing the syndrome is unknown. A number of endogenous vasopressor substances have been examined without conclusive findings. Pharmacologic and methodologic advances over the last decade have resulted in a body of information implicating serotonin as a mediator in the genesis of preeclamptic hypertension. This information is summarized and a possible mechanism of delivery and action is suggested.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia presents serious risk of both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Biomarkers for the detection of preeclampsia are critical for risk assessment and targeted intervention. The goal of this study is to screen potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of preeclampsia and to illuminate the pathogenesis of preeclampsia development based on the differential expression network. Two groups of subjects, including healthy pregnant women, subjects with preeclampsia, were recruited for this study. The metabolic profiles of all of the subjects' serum were obtained by liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Correlation between metabolites was analyzed by bioinformatics technique. Results showed that the PC(14:0/00), proline betaine and proline were potential sensitive and specific biomarkers for preeclampsia diagnosis and prognosis. Perturbation of corresponding biological pathways, such as iNOS signaling, nitric oxide signaling in the cardiovascular system, mitochondrial dysfunction were responsible for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. This study indicated that the metabolic profiling had a good clinical significance in the diagnosis of preeclampsia as well as in the study of its pathogenesis.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To evaluate the effect of dietary and lifestyle interventions with the potential to modify metabolic risk factors on the risk of preeclampsia. Data sources: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane from inception until February 2013. Randomized trials in pregnant women evaluating the effect of dietary and lifestyle interventions with the potential to modify metabolic risks such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension on the risk of preeclampsia were included. Study selection: Two independent reviewers selected studies, extracted data and assessed quality. Results were summarized as pooled relative risks (RR) for dichotomous data. Results: Eighteen studies (8712 women) met our search criteria for inclusion. Six studies evaluated diet (2695 women), six studied mixed interventions with diet, physical activity and lifestyle (1438 women) and six assessed essential fatty acid supplementation (4579 women). The interventions overall reduced the risk of preeclampsia (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.94; p = 0.006 I(2) = 0%) compared with the control group. Dietary interventions reduced the risk of preeclampsia by 33% (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.85; p = 0.001; I(2) = 0%). There was no reduction in the risk of preeclampsia with mixed interventions (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.66-1.32, p = 0.68, I(2) = 0%) or fatty acid supplementation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71-1.18; p = 0.49, I(2) = 15%). Meta-regression showed a borderline impact of gestational diabetes status (p = 0.05) on the observed effect. Conclusion: Dietary and lifestyle interventions have the potential to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. The effect of additional therapeutic interventions in women with gestational diabetes mellitus on preeclampsia is not known.",preeclampsia
"Background: Liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) and endoglin have been postulated to play roles in trophoblast invasion and lipid metabolic disturbances. However, the relationship between LXRα and endoglin levels in serum and placenta of patients with preeclampsia remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to identify correlations between LXRα, endoglin and preeclampsia and provide new feasible methods of clinical prediction and treatment for preeclampsia. Methods: We enrolled 45 patients with preeclampsia (24 with moderate preeclampsia and 21 with severe preeclampsia) and 15 normal pregnant women (control group) who were admitted to the Department of Obstetrics of the General Hospital of Beijing Command between October 2012 and July 2013 in this study. Serum and placental LXRα and endoglin levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, real-time quantitative PCR, tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. Results: Serum and placental LXRα and endoglin levels were significantly higher in patients with preeclampsia than those in control group (P<0.05, each). Moreover, patients with severe preeclampsia displayed significantly higher LXRα and endoglin levels than those with moderate preeclampsia (P<0.05, each). The LXRα sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 66.00%, 80.00%, 89.19% and 48.48%, respectively, while those of endoglin levels were 62.00%, 85.00%, 91.18% and 47.22%, respectively. LXRα and endoglin levels in serum and placenta from patients with preeclampsia were positively correlated (serum: r = 0.486, P<0.01; placenta: r = 0.569, P<0.01). Conclusions: Elevated LXRα and endoglin levels may be associated with preeclampsia pathogenesis and development and could be used as potential predictors for this disorder.",preeclampsia
The application of uterine artery Doppler velocimetry as a screening test for pre-eclampsia and other adverse pregnancy complications is still considered a research tool by most obstetricians. Increasing use of colour Doppler ultrasound has allowed a better understanding of pathophysiological changes in the uterine circulation. This in turn has refocused attention on the potential use of uterine artery Doppler velocimetry as part of our antenatal screening strategy. This review summarizes the most recent work surrounding the application of this test as a screening test for pre-eclampsia.,preeclampsia
"The National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy recently issued a report implicating hypertension as a complication in 6 to 8 percent of pregnancies. Hypertension in pregnancy is related to one of four conditions: (1) chronic hypertension that predates pregnancy; (2) preeclampsia-eclampsia, a serious, systemic syndrome of elevated blood pressure, proteinuria and other findings; (3) chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia; and (4) gestational hypertension, or nonproteinuric hypertension of pregnancy. Edema is no longer a criterion for preeclampsia, and the definition of blood pressure elevation is 140/90 mm Hg or higher. Patients with gestational hypertension have previously unrecognized chronic hypertension, emerging preeclampsia or transient hypertension of pregnancy, an obstetrically benign condition. Because distinguishing among these conditions can be done only in retrospect, clinical management of gestational hypertension consists of repeated evaluations to look for signs of emerging preeclampsia. Women with chronic hypertension should be followed for evidence of fetal growth restriction or superimposed preeclampsia. Management options for chronic hypertension in most women include discontinuing antihypertensive medications during pregnancy, switching to methyldopa or continuing previous antihypertensive therapy.",preeclampsia
"Introduction: Pre-eclampsia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality for mother and baby, with post partum resolution. The disorder is triggered by a placental pathology followed by a wide spectrum of maternal systemic response. However, there remains controversy in practically every aspect of the condition. Methods: A Medline search and hand search of recent publications pertaining to the scientific basis and clinical management of pre-eclampsia. Results: With current interest in the scientific and molecular basis of the disease process, there has been an improved, albeit incomplete, understanding of the precise aetiology and pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Much of this has translated to improved clinical management strategies. The more rational use of various pharmacological agents, timing the delivery to optimise both the maternal and fetal condition, the decreasing rate of eclampsia, as well as trials on various screening and prophylactic strategies are testimony to this improvement. Despite this, many unanswered questions still remain and provide a challenge for both the clinician as well as the researcher. Conclusions: We reviewed the recent literature in order to provide a contemporary understanding of the basic pathogenesis of the condition as well as to highlight some basic strategies for clinical management. There is a clear need for more research to better understand the basic science behind the genesis of this condition, as well as to improve the level of care we offer to these women through the co-ordination of a multi-disciplinary team of clinicians.",preeclampsia
"The main objective of expectant management in women with severe pre-eclampsia (PE) remote from term is to improve neonatal outcome. Maternal conditions, however, may worsen during expectant management. This highlights the importance of balancing the risks between maternal and perinatal outcomes. Traditionally, women with severe PE remote from term are delivered expeditiously, regardless of gestational age. We here have reported several retrospective, case-control, observational, prospective, or randomized trials in which expectant management in women with severe PE was feasible in well-selected patients without prejudicing maternal safety, and we have described our rationale and guidelines for this management.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a multi-system disorder involved in pregnancy without an effective treatment except delivery. The precise pathogenesis of this complicated disorder is still not completely understood. The objective of this study is to evaluate the alterations of protein expression and phosphorylations that are important in regulating placental cell function in preterm and term preeclampsia. Using the Protein Pathway Array, 38 proteins in placental tissues were found to be differentially expressed between preterm preeclampsia and gestational age matched control, while 25 proteins were found to be expressed differentially between term preeclampsia and matched controls. Among these proteins, 16 proteins and their associated signaling pathways overlapped between preterm and term preeclampsia, suggesting the common pathogenesis of two subsets of disease. On the other hand, many proteins are uniquely altered in either preterm or term preeclampsia and correlated with severity of clinical symptoms and outcomes, therefore, providing molecular basis for these two subsets of preeclampsia. Furthermore, the expression levels of some of these proteins correlated with neonatal small for gestational age (PAI-1 and PAPP-A) and adverse outcomes (Flt-1) in women with preterm preeclampsia. These proteins could potentially be used as candidate biomarkers for predicting outcomes of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: To examine the deportation of trophoblast cells into the maternal blood in pre-eclamptic (gestational proteinuric hypertension) and normal pregnancy. Design: The monoclonal anti-cytokeratin antibody JMB2 was used in the APAAP technique to label trophoblast cells in cell smears of uterine vein blood obtained at caesarean section. Subjects: 10 women with proteinuric pre-eclampsia requiring caesarean section, 10 pregnant women requiring elective caesarean section for reasons other than pre-eclampsia and five control women who had never been pregnant. Results: Three populations of trophoblast cells were identified; two mononuclear cytotrophoblast types with diameters varying from 11-14 microns and 19-25 microns respectively, and multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast cells varying in size from 23-88 microns. Women with pre-eclampsia had more trophoblast cells in uterine vein blood than were found in pregnant women without pre-eclampsia. There was no correlation between the numbers of trophoblast cells and the stage of gestation or severity of the pre-eclampsia, although an acute maternal or fetal event necessitating delivery was associated with increased deportation of trophoblast. Mononuclear cytotrophoblast cells were detected in the peripheral blood of only 1 of 5 pre-eclamptic patients, despite their presence in the uterine vein blood of all 5 women. Conclusions: Trophoblast deportation is increased in pre-eclamptic pregnancy, with both cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast present in the uterine vein blood, but there is no correlation with the severity of the disease. In some cases cytotrophoblast may also enter the peripheral circulation.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy complicate approximately 10% of all deliveries in the United States and are a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia is defined as hypertension in association with proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, impaired liver function, renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema, or new-onset cerebral or visual disturbances. The greatest risk factor for the development of preeclampsia is a history of preeclampsia. There currently is no effective means for the prevention of preeclampsia. Approximately 39% of patients diagnosed with preeclampsia have hypertension and approximately 20% have proteinuria 3 months postpartum. Preeclampsia increases the risk of patients developing hypertension later in life.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia (PE) has a profound effect in increasing both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality especially in third World. Disturbances of extravillous trophoblast migration toward uterine spiral arteries is characteristic feature of PE, which, in turn, leads to increased uteroplacental vascular resistance and by vascular dysfunction resulting in reduced systemic vasodilatory properties. Underlying pathogenesis appeared to be an altered bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO•) and tissue damage caused by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). The increase in ROS and RNS production or the decrease in antioxidant mechanisms generates a condition called oxidative and nitrosative stress, respectively, defined as the imbalance between pro- and antioxidants in favor of the oxidants. Additionally, ROS might trigger platelet adhesion and aggregation leading to intravascular coagulopathy. ROS-induced coagulopathy causes placental infarction and impairs the uteroplacental blood flow in PE. As a consequence of these disorders could result in deficiencies in oxygen and nutrients required for normal fetal development resulting in fetal growth restriction. On the one hand, enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants scavenge ROS and protect tissues against oxidative damage. More specifically, placental antioxidant enzymes including catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) protect the vasculature from ROS, maintaining the vascular function. On the other hand, ischemia in placenta in PE reduces the antioxidant activity. Collectively, the extent of oxidative stress would increase and therefore leads to the development of the pathological findings of PE including hypertension and proteinuria. Our goal in this article is to review current literature about researches demonstrating the interplay between oxidative, nitrosative stresses and PE, about their roles in the pathophysiology of PE and also about the outcomes of current clinical trials aiming to prevent PE with antioxidant supplementation.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: To characterise the changes in serum visfatin levels in late normal pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. Methods: Twenty-seven women with pre-eclampsia were recruited. Twenty-eight women in the third trimester of normal pregnancy served as pregnant control and 28 healthy non-pregnant women as non-pregnant control. Serum levels of visfatin were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The means of serum visfatin were 626.4+/-45.5 ng/ml (mean+/-SEM) in non-pregnant control, 695.9+/-92.5 ng/ml in pregnant control, and 308.3+/-80.0 ng/ml in pre-eclampsia, respectively, and were significantly different among the groups (p<0.001). Visfatin level was significantly lower in pre-eclampsia compared to non-pregnant control (p=0.004) and pregnant control (p<0.001). Women with severe pre-eclampsia had a significantly lower serum visfatin level than those with mild pre-eclampsia (114.6+/-80.9 versus 425.2+/-122.1 ng/ml, p=0.037). Conclusions: A decrease in visfatin level was demonstrated in pre-eclampsia, suggesting that visfatin and adipokine-associated metabolic abnormalities are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.",preeclampsia
"Hypertension is one of the most common complications of pregnancy, with potential adverse effects for both mother and fetus. Controversy exists in the classification and differential diagnosis of the hypertensive disorders, which include preeclampsia-eclampsia, chronic hypertension, preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension, and transient hypertension.

With proper diagnosis and treatment, pregnant hypertensive patients should be spared the most serious sequelae of hypertension, and most should enjoy a successful pregnancy outcome.",preeclampsia
"The changes in the ratio between factor VIII-related antigen and factor VIII activity were compared in ten patients with normal pregnancies and in ten patients with severe pre-eclampsia. In the patients with pre-eclampsia, a highly significant increase in the ratio was observed during the third trimester. No difference in the ratio between the two groups was found on day 7 of the puerperium. In the pre-eclamptic patients, the highest ratios for factor VIII-related antigen to factor VIII activity were associated with either a perinatal death or with the delivery of a severely growth retarded infant. These findings are in keeping with an increased rate of thrombin production in women with pre-eclampsia, and suggest that the ratio of factor VIII-related antigen to factor VIII activity may reflect the severity of the effect of the disease process on the fetus.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a multisystemic disorder that is characterised by endothelial cell dysfunction as a consequence of abnormal genetic and immunological mechanisms. Despite active research for years, the exact aetiology of this potentially fatal disorder remains unknown. Although understanding of the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia has improved, management has not changed significantly over the years. Anaesthetic management of these patients remains a challenge. Although general anaesthesia can be used safely in pre-eclamptic women, it is fraught with greater maternal morbidity and mortality. Currently, the safety of regional anaesthesia techniques is well established and they can provide better obstetrical outcome when chosen properly. Thus, regional anaesthesia is extensively used for the management of pain and labour in women with pre-eclampsia. This article highlights the advantages and disadvantages of regional anaesthetic techniques including epidural, spinal and combined spinal-epidural analgesia, used as a part of the management of pre-eclampsia. The problems associated with general anaesthesia and controversies in relation to obstetric regional anaesthesia are discussed.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a serious, pregnancy-specific, multi-organ disease process of compound aetiology. It affects 3-6% of expecting mothers worldwide and it persists as a leading cause of maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality. In fact, hallmark features of preeclampsia (PE) result from vessel involvement and demonstrate maternal endothelium as a target tissue. Growing evidence suggests that chronic placental hypoperfusion triggers the production and release of certain agents that are responsible for endothelial activation and injury. In this review, we will present the latest findings on the role of nitric oxide, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and homocysteine in the etiopathogenesis of preeclampsia and their possible clinical implications.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia (PE) is associated with an increase in maternal arterial stiffness, which may be reflected by photoplethysmography (PPG) of the pulse wave. The aim of this study was to investigate area difference ratio (ADR), a novel parameter derived from PPG, in women with and without preeclampsia. Methods: Patients with and without preeclampsia in the third trimester were enrolled. All patients had photoplethysmography of the pulse wave assessed. ADR was compared between the two groups. Results: Seventy-two patients in the third trimester of gestation, of which 36 had preeclampsia and 36 did not, were enrolled. The ADR was lower in the preeclampsia group vs. the non-preeclampsia group (0.725 [IQR 0.681-0.779] vs. 0.752 [IQR 0.717-0.910], P < 0.01). Conclusions: Measuring the ADR through analyzing PPG of the pulse wave may be a useful diagnostic tool in patients with preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Purpose: Pre-eclampsia is a major complication of pregnancy. Although the disorder usually becomes apparent only in the third trimester of pregnancy, evidence is available that underlying pathophysiological abnormalities are already present early in pregnancy. The association between alterations in autonomic cardiovascular control and the development of hypertension in pregnancy has been investigated for some time. Non-invasive methods are especially of interest, since they have the advantage of minimal risk for the mother and the conceptus and enable repeated measurements during pregnancy. If non-invasive tests for autonomic cardiovascular control could demonstrate the increased sympathetic activity, as observed by microneurography than this method is a candidate for early identification of pre-eclampsia. Therefore, the literature on non-invasive testing of autonomic cardiovascular control in normal pregnancies and pre-eclampsia was summarized. Data identification and selection: Medline was searched and 36 articles on autonomic cardiovascular control in human pregnancy by non-invasive test methods were reviewed. For each test method, data of different studies were summarized to evaluate if the method could discriminate between healthy pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. Conclusion: Although small differences have been observed between normal pregnancy and pre-eclampsia in individual studies using non-invasive methods, the consistency in the available data is insufficient to discriminate between normal pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. The failure to demonstrate the increased sympathetic activity, as observed by direct microneurography, might be due to methodological factors of the non-invasive studies. Alternatively, sympathetic activity to resistance vessels in skeletal muscle may not be a proper reflection of autonomic cardiovascular control in pregnancy. Well-designed longitudinal research could be useful to test these suppositions.",preeclampsia
"Background: The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), a prospective population-based pregnancy cohort, is a valuable database for studying causes of pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia data in MoBa come from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN); thus, we wanted to study the validity of MBRN pre-eclampsia registration for MoBa women. Methods: We selected all MoBa pregnancies with pre-eclampsia registered in the MBRN (n = 4081) and a random control group (n = 2000) without pre-eclampsia registrations. After excluding two delivery units not participating in MoBa and one no longer operating, units were asked to provide copies of antenatal charts with blood pressure and urinary measurements from all antenatal visits during pregnancy, and hospital discharge codes from the delivery stay. We received data for 5340 pregnancies delivered 1999-2010 (87% of all eligible). We calculated positive predictive value (PPV), and sensitivity and specificity of MBRN registration, using hypertension and proteinuria on the antenatal charts and/or hospital discharge codes indicating pre-eclampsia as gold standard. Results: Overall PPV was 83.9% [95% CI 82.7, 85.1] and was higher when women were primiparous, or delivered preterm or low birthweight infants. Severe pre-eclampsia in the MBRN was found to be a true severe pre-eclampsia in 70% of cases. Extrapolating to the total MoBa population, the estimated sensitivity was low - 43.0% (38.7, 48.2) - while specificity was high - 99.2% (99.2, 99.3). False negative cases seemed to have mild forms of pre-eclampsia. Conclusions: PPV and specificity of pre-eclampsia registration in the MBRN during 1999-2010 was satisfactory, while sensitivity was low.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia occurs in 3-5% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of deaths of mothers and their infants worldwide. It was initially described over 100 yr ago as a pregnancy abnormality defined by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria. Progress in understanding the pathophysiology was impeded by attention to these diagnostic findings. Hypertension and proteinuria were actually serendipitously recognized components of a complex multisystemic syndrome and not especially pertinent to outcome. With the recognition of inflammatory activation with consequent endothelial dysfunction 30 yr ago redirection of research resulted in an explosive increase in understanding of the disorder. The immunological origins, the role of the placenta and its functional alterations due to endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress, identification of placental products linking placental dysfunction to maternal systemic pathophysiology, and the role of the maternal constitution have been elegantly demonstrated by clinical, fundamental, and epidemiological findings and clever animal experimentation. Nonetheless, this increase in knowledge has not translated into improved prediction and prevention of preeclampsia. In this presentation the likelihood is discussed that this is secondary to a much greater complexity than has been previously considered and the existence of subtypes of preeclampsia that may not share an identical pathophysiology. The necessity for collaboration with data, sample, and intellectual sharing is addressed. An approach to addressing the challenges posed to such collaboration exemplified by the Global Pregnancy Collaboration is presented.",preeclampsia
"Eclampsia, the occurrence of a seizure in association with pre-eclampsia, remains an important cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. Despite being recognised since antiquity, consistent management practices are still lacking. Given that the aim of good care is to prevent seizures, it is disappointing that in the majority of cases the first eclamptic convulsion occurs after admission to hospital. This indicates that either the women who are likely to have a convulsion were not identified accurately, or the treatment given was ineffective. The answer to poor management of eclampsia lies in better education and training of all obstetricians, anaesthetists, midwives, and general practitioners in the diagnosis and treatment of severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Protocols for the management of fluid balance, antihypertensive and anticonvulsant therapies should be available and reviewed regularly. The universal adoption of such guidelines in all obstetric units would substantially reduce elements of substandard care which have repeatedly been identified in the triennial reports of the confidential enquiries into maternal deaths in the UK.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific syndrome, it occurs in approximately 5-10% of all pregnancies and the etiology remains unknown, but the primigravida adolescent as such as multigravid older women whom have conceived with a new sexual partner have a greater risk, this has been associated also with the use of barrier contraceptive methods that prevent exposure to sperm with the endometrial cavity. An immunological factor has been suspected because fetal antigen's could cause antigenic reaction with the maternal immunological apparatus, for first exposure at these antigens, since the fetus is considered like an allotransplantation. This is supported in some studies that report that the use of condoms, spermicides and withdrawal are associated with developing of preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancy, and another hand indicate at cohabitation preceded for long period, practiced oral sex and use of contraceptive methods that permit exposure to sperm viable with uterus decreased the prevalence of preeclampsia. To test this hypothesis, we initially used data from two groups of pregnant women, comparing the contraceptive and reproductive history of 73 pregnant women with preeclampsia and 70 pregnant women without preeclampsia. The odds ratio for preeclampsia indicated a 2.52-fold (with 95% confidence interval, 1.17 to 5.44, p < 0.05), increased risk of preeclampsia for users of barrier contraceptives compared with women using nonbarrier contraceptives methods. Other variables like socio-demographic and obstetrics analysis were not different between both groups. This study suggest that nonbarrier contraceptive methods or the exposure of paternal spermatic antigens is protective against development of preeclampsia. Further immunological studies are necessary to determine the role of contraception methods and preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome remain as major obstetric problems that plague a large percentage of women resulting in an equally large percentage of maternal and perinatal morbidities. It is important that a clinician makes the most accurate diagnosis possible to prevent these adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. In general, most women will have a classical presentation of preeclampsia (hypertension and proteinuria) at >20 weeks gestation and <48 hours postpartum. However, recent studies have suggested that some women will develop preeclampsia without the classical findings. The purpose of this review is to increase awareness of the non-classical and atypical features of preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome and their respective management. Atypical cases are those that develop before 20 weeks, beyond 48 hours postpartum and those that present with some of the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia without the usual hypertension or proteinuria. By formulating a rational stepwise approach towards diagnosis, we may prevent the costly consequence of a missed diagnosis and its eventual possible fatalities.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy have been the cause of much clinical dilemma, affecting up to 10 % of all pregnancies. The precise blood pressure to achieve in a pregnant woman is usually a battle between minimizing end organ damage to the mother and providing adequate perfusion to the placenta and the fetus. This predicament is becoming more, not less, frequent as maternal ages increase in high resource nations. Biomarkers to predict preeclampsia, a subcategory of hypertension in pregnancy, have always been elusive. The discovery of angiogenic factors relevant to preeclampsia in the last decade, however, has propelled much needed research, both in the basic science and clinical arenas. In this review, we summarize the latest clinical studies and international guidelines on blood pressure goals in pregnancy, and discuss the most promising of biomarkers to predict or diagnose preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder unique to pregnancy with consistent involvement of the kidney. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. In the gravid state, in addition to the RAS in the kidney, there is a tissue-based RAS in the uteroplacental unit. Increased renin expression observed both in human preeclampsia and in a transgenic mouse model with a human preeclampsia-like syndrome supports the concept that activation of the uteroplacental RAS, with angiotensin II entering the systemic circulation, may mediate the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. A novel disease paradigm of the two-kidney one-clip (2K-1C) Goldblatt model is presented for preeclampsia, wherein the gravid uterus is the clipped ""kidney"" and the two maternal kidneys represent the unclipped kidney. Validation of the 2K-1C Goldblatt model analogy requires evidence of elevated angiotensin II in the peripheral circulation before vascular maladaptation in preeclampsia. Convincing evidence of the elevation of angiotensin II in preeclampsia does not exist despite the fact that much of vascular pathogenesis appears to be due to angiotensin type I (AT(1)) receptor activation. Vascular maladaptation with increased vasomotor tone, endothelial dysfunction, and increased sensitivity to angiotensin II and norepinephrine in manifest preeclampsia may be explained on the basis of angiotensin II-mediated mechanisms. Recently, novel angiotensin II-related biomolecular mechanisms have been described in preeclampsia. These include AT(1) and bradykinin B(2) receptor heterodimerization and the production of an autoantibody against AT(1). Various organ systems with a predilection for involvement in preeclampsia are each a site of a tissue-based RAS. How angiotensin II-mediated mechanisms may explain the primary clinical-pathological features of preeclampsia is described. Future investigations are proposed to more precisely define the role of activation of the uteroplacental RAS in the mechanisms underlying preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: To assess the economic impact of introducing into clinical practice in the UK the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt-1) to placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio test for guiding the management of pre-eclampsia. Methods: We used an economic model estimating the incremental value of information, from a UK National Health Service payer's perspective, generated by the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio test, compared with current diagnostic procedures, in guiding the management of women with suspected pre-eclampsia. The economic model estimated costs associated with the diagnosis and management of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women between 24 + 0 and 36 + 6 weeks' gestation, managed in either a 'test' scenario in which the sFlt-1/PlGF test is used in addition to current diagnostic procedures, or a 'no-test' scenario in which clinical decisions are based on current diagnostic procedures alone. Test characteristics and resource use were derived from PROGNOSIS, a non-interventional study in women presenting with clinical suspicion of pre-eclampsia. The main outcome measure from the economic model was the cost per patient per episode of care, from first suspicion of pre-eclampsia to birth. Results: Introduction of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio test into clinical practice is expected to result in cost savings of £344 per patient compared with a no-test scenario. Savings are generated primarily through an improvement in diagnostic accuracy and subsequent reduction in unnecessary hospitalization. Conclusions: Introducing the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio test into clinical practice in the UK was shown to be cost-saving by reducing unnecessary hospitalization of women at low risk of developing pre-eclampsia. In addition, the test ensures that those women at higher risk are identified and managed appropriately. © 2016 Authors.

"The aim of this study is to prospectively assess pregnancy hormone levels as correlates of subsequent development of pre-eclampsia, a condition that has been shown to be inversely associated with breast cancer risk in the offspring. A cohort of 260 Caucasian women in Boston, Massachusetts, was followed through pregnancy. Maternal blood was collected at the 16th and 27th weeks of gestation, and 18 women were diagnosed with pre-eclampsia after blood collection. Information on sociodemographic variables and risk factors of pre-eclampsia was collected through an interviewer-administered questionnaire and review of medical records. At the 16th week, there was a nonsignificant positive association between progesterone levels and pre-eclampsia [relative risk (RR) = 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.97-2.74, per 1 SD increase]. By the 27th week, the association between progesterone and pre-eclampsia was strengthened (RR = 2.65, 95% CI, 1.46-4.81, per SD), and sex hormone-binding globulin levels were somewhat inversely related to pre-eclampsia (RR = 0.61, 95% CI, 0.31-1.20, per SD). No difference was found with respect to prolactin, estradiol, and estriol levels. Our findings indicate that progesterone may have a role in the late manifestation of pre-eclampsia pathology but are also compatible with the hypothesis that increases in progesterone represent an early compensatory mechanism.",preeclampsia
"Hypertension is the most common medical disorder encountered during pregnancy, occurring in about 6-8 % of pregnancies. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disorder that occurs after 20 weeks' gestation, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. Preeclampsia can also occur superimposed upon chronic hypertension. Eclampsia is the convulsive form of preeclampsia, and affects 0.1 % of all pregnancies. In low-income and middle-income countries, preeclampsia and eclampsia are associated with 10-15 % of direct maternal deaths. Women who develop preeclampsia in pregnancy are at greater risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events even years after their pregnancies. There is significant progress in the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms and pathophysiology of preeclampsia, although its therapeutics remains challenging; delivery of the fetus is still the definitive treatment. Different international societies have produced recommendations and guidelines for clinicians treating preeclampsia, with an overall goal of improving maternal and fetal outcomes. In this review, we focus on the level of blood pressure at which to commence treatment and the current clinical management strategies available to treat and possibly prevent preeclampsia. We also briefly outline some newer perspectives on management of the disorder.",preeclampsia
"Hypertension in pregnancy is defined by a systolic blood pressure > or = 140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of > or = 90 mm Hg or by a rise in blood pressure of systolic > or = 30 mm Hg and diastolic > or = 15 mm Hg. High blood pressures are found in 5-10% of all pregnancies. The outcome of pregnancy is influenced by the fact whether there occurs a proteinuria in addition to hypertension. While the prognosis of an isolated hypotension is good, the combination of hypertension and proteinuria leading to preeclampsia is the primary cause of maternal death in many countries and is responsible for 20-25% of perinatal mortality. A simple classification divides between chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension and transient hypertension. With chronic hypertension pregnancy outcome is determined by a preexisting nephropathy and the occurrence of a superimposed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia and superimposed preeclampsia are pregnancy induced multiorganic diseases, endangering both the mother and the fetus. Transient hypertension is a benign pathology, which occurs toward the end of pregnancy usually on the basis of a latent essential hypertension, which is laid open through pregnancy. While a severe chronic hypertension in pregnancy must be treated to prevent a hypertensive maternal encephalopathy, a less severe chronic hypertension should not be treated as the risk of a superimposed preeclampsia and the maternal and fetal outcome cannot be influenced by antihypertensive therapy. The incidence of preeclampsia is 3-5% in nulliparae and 0.5% in multiparae. Preeclampsia is a severe and dangerous pathology with an unknown etiology. Pregnancy termination is the only causal therapy. At present it is still recommended to terminate a severe preeclampsia after stabilizing the mother, irrespective of gestational age. In less severe preeclampsia occurring before 32 weeks of gestation, termination of pregnancy can be postponed under intensive monitoring and a prophylaxis with magnesium sulfate in order to accelerate the fetal lung maturation with glucocorticoids. A conservative management in the case of a HELLP-syndrome (Haemolyis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets), which is a very severe form of preeclampsia, is not recommended because it hasn't been validated in prospective controlled studies. The most dangerous complication of preeclampsia is eclampsia, which is defined by general tonic-clonic convulsions before or after birth. The most effective prophylaxis of eclamptic attacks is the intravenous therapy with magnesium sulfate. A primary prohylaxis for preeclampsia doesn't exist. Treatment with low-dose aspirin in high-risk patients, i.e. after a severe preeclampsia, in cases of chronic hypertension, in cases of nephropathy and in cases with antiphospholipid-syndrome++ can be recommended. The prophylactic use of low-dose heparin, which has lead to a significant decreased incidence of preeclampsia in retrospective analysis, is now the object of a randomized, controlled trial in our hospital. All women who suffered from a preeclampsia should have a check-up after 3-6 months. Preexisting pathologies are found in up to 40% of patients, mostly in multiparae, i.e. chronic hypertension, nephropathy, endocrine pathologies, anomalies of blood coagulation and antiphospolipid-syndrome.",preeclampsia
"Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop a model for preeclampsia based on maternal demographic characteristics and medical history. Study design: This was a screening study of 120,492 singleton pregnancies at 11-13 weeks' gestation, including 2704 pregnancies (2.2%) that experienced preeclampsia. A survival-time model for the gestational age at delivery with preeclampsia was developed from variables of maternal characteristics and history. This approach assumes that, if the pregnancy was to continue indefinitely, all women would experience preeclampsia and that whether they do so or not before a specified gestational age depends on competition between delivery before or after development of preeclampsia. A 5-fold cross validation study was conducted to compare the performance of the new model with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. Results: In the new model, increased risk for preeclampsia, with a consequent shift in the Gaussian distribution of the gestational age at delivery with preeclampsia to the left, is provided by advancing maternal age, increasing weight, Afro-Caribbean and South Asian racial origin, medical history of chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome, family history and personal history of preeclampsia, and conception by in vitro fertilization. The risk for preeclampsia decreases with increasing maternal height and in parous women with no previous preeclampsia; in the latter, the protective effect, which is related inversely to the interpregnancy interval, persists beyond 15 years. At a screen-positive rate of 11%, as defined by NICE, the new model predicted 40%, 48%, and 54% of cases of total preeclampsia and preeclampsia requiring delivery at <37 and <34 weeks' gestation, respectively, which were significantly higher than the respective values of 35%, 40%, and 44% achieved by application of NICE guidelines. Conclusion: A new model that is based on maternal characteristics and medical history has been developed for the estimation of patient-specific risks for preeclampsia. Such estimation of the a priori risk for preeclampsia is an essential first step in the use of Bayes theorem to combine maternal factors with biomarkers for the continuing development of more effective methods of screening for the disease.",preeclampsia
"In summary, the major pathophysiologic event that occurs in women with preeclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension is vasospasm. In turn, vasospasm leads to a wide range of dysfunction in many organ systems.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia affects up to 8% of pregnancies worldwide and is a leading cause of both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Our current understanding of the cause(s) of preeclampsia is far from complete, and the lack of a single reliable animal model that recapitulates all aspects of the disease further confounds our understanding. This is partially due to the heterogeneous nature of the disease, coupled with our evolving understanding of its etiology. Nevertheless, animal models are still highly relevant and useful tools that help us better understand the pathophysiology of specific aspects of preeclampsia. This review summarizes the various types and characteristics of animal models used to study preeclampsia, highlighting particular features of these models relevant to clinical translation. This review points out the strengths and limitations of these models to illustrate the importance of using the appropriate model depending on the research question.",preeclampsia
"Objective: It is to show the possible relationship between the patofysiology of pre-eclampsia in the body of a human with a relative lack of L-arginine and its potential connection with a nitrogen metabolism. This study also suggests the further utilization of above mentioned knowledges in a prevention and a treatment of pre-eclampsia. Design: Literary overview. Setting: Gynaecology and Obstetric Department of the Hospital Kromeriz, Inc., Kromeriz. Methods: The background research of studies and issues published already in medical professional journals, bulletins and medical web databases. Conclusion: To provide L-arginine to pregnant women as a dietary supplement concerns no risk and is an easy precaution. L-arginine can reduce the occurrance of pre-eclampsia in women with a potential high risk of its development. The most important transmitter substance that makes L-arginine work is the dioxide nitrogen. So far, it has been the outmost possibility how to influence the patofysiology of Pre-eclampsia The lack of L-arginine and its influence on the nitrogen metabolism is likely, but there is also a great need for further research.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific condition that increases maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. It is diagnosed by new-onset increased blood pressure and proteinuria during gestation; for many years these markers were the sole targets for study. More recently, increased attention to the multisystemic nature of the syndrome with involvement of almost all organs, activation of coagulation and increased sensitivity to pressor agents has expanded understanding of the disorder. The epidemiology of preeclampsia, being more common in poor women, long ago suggested that nutrients might be involved in the disorder. Numerous conflicting hypotheses were advanced but the testing of these hypotheses has either been done poorly or not at all. Review of the available data indicates very few studies that provide useful insights. In many studies the syndrome is poorly defined and in most studies nutritional data (questionnaires or biomarkers) are obtained on women with the clinical syndrome. In overtly preeclamptic women it is impossible to decipher cause from effect. Nonetheless, current concepts of the genesis of preeclampsia that include endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory activation, oxidative stress and predisposing maternal factors provide targets for well-designed nutritional investigation. In this review the current concepts of the pathogenesis of preeclampsia are reviewed and available data are assessed in light of these concepts. Targets for nutritional investigation based on the current knowledge of pathophysiology are suggested.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is characterised by reduced utero-placental blood flow which in turn results from vascular damage occurring early in pregnancy. Endothelial damage and reduced prostacyclin and nitric oxide synthesis will initiate excessive platelet aggregation, fibrin deposition and vascular occlusion. Prevention of pre-eclampsia is dependent on affecting this process. Antiplatelet therapy is being assessed as a prophylaxis. Screening tests using increased platelet turnover as their basis are also being assessed.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is an inflammatory condition, involving the pregnant mother and complicated by the presence of a growing child and a disfunctional placenta; such is its complexity that so far no one has been able to fully elucidate its pathophysiology. Varicose veins are an inflammatory condition also, but far simpler and localised, whose pathophysiology has recently been virtually fully established by a combination of clinical observation, animal experiment and analysis of stripped veins. They have indicated the immediate cause of inflammation is stimulation of a tissue by increased levels of plasma noradrenaline, at basal concentration, diffusing into it from its microcirculation. The hypothesis offered here applies that information and proposes the changes in the uteroplacental tissues in preeclampsia are a result of a decreased level of microcirculatory noradrenaline stimulation, and the changes in the maternal tissues are a result of an increased level. The dichotomy means any treatment likely to benefit the mother in preeclampsia is likely to harm the child and vice versa. That may explain why the spectacular therapeutic advances of the past 50-60 years have had, relatively, so little impact on the treatment of preeclampsia. However, experiments aimed at finding tissue specific drugs to treat different aspects of HIV and individual types of cancer offer some slight hope that in the long term it may be possible to at least alleviate preeclampsia, if not cure it.",preeclampsia
"Introduction: Pre-eclampsia is a common disorder associated with serious maternal and fetal complications. It is associated with abnormal placentation, which significantly reduces flow, resulting in a relative hypoxic state. These pathophysiological changes lead to subtle macrovascular and cardiac structural and functional changes in the fetus. This can predispose the child with maternal history of pre-eclampsia to risk of premature cardiovascular disease. Methods and analysis: The children will be identified from a cohort of women with pre-eclampsia. The study will be conducted at The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. Inclusion criteria will be children who are between 2 and 5 years of age and have a maternal history of pre-eclampsia. The child's current weight, height and blood pressure will be recorded. A two-dimensional functional echocardiogram and vascular assessment will be performed to evaluate alterations in cardiac function as well as macrovascular remodelling in these children. Data will be presented as mean±SD, median (IQR) or percentages as appropriate. Independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test will be used for testing of continuous variables (based on the assumption of normality). A p<0.05 will be used to determine statistical significance. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval has been obtained from AKUH Ethics Review Committee. Findings will be disseminated through scientific publications and project summaries for the participants.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a multi-system condition in pregnancy that is characterised by the onset of hypertension and proteinuria in women after the 20th week and it remains a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality. Despite this the causative molecular basis of pre-eclampsia remains poorly understood. As a result, an intensive research effort has focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in pre-eclampsia and using this information to identify new pre-symptomatic bio-markers of the condition. Activin A and its receptor, ACVR2A, have been extensively studied in this regard. Activin A is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily that has a wide range of biological functions depending on the cellular context. Recent work has shown that polymorphisms in ACVR2A may be a genetic risk factor for pre-eclampsia. Furthermore, both placenta and serum levels of Activin A are significantly increased in pre-eclampsia suggesting that Activin A may be a possible biomarker for the condition. Here we review the latest advances in this field and link these with new molecular data that suggest that the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine production seen in pre-eclampsia may result in increased placental Activin A secretion in an attempt to maintain placental function.",preeclampsia
The significance of nitric-oxide as a biological mediator is increasingly elucidated in various physiological processes. In addition to the endothelium dependent vasodilator effect it also plays an important role as a neurotransmitter. Possible synthesis of endothelial nitric-oxide is an essential factor in the regulation of blood pressure and utero-placental circulation. Recently the relationship of nitric-oxide and preeclampsia has extensively been studied. The results of human studies and animal experiments suggest that insufficient production of endothelial nitric-oxide probably has an important role in the pathomechanism of preeclampsia.,preeclampsia
"Angiogenesis is the process of neovascularization from preexisting blood vessels, whereas vasculogenesis is the process of blood vessel generation from angioblast precursor cells. The human placenta undergoes high levels of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis during fetal development. Additionally, the placenta undergoes a process of vascular mimicry (also referred to as pseudovasculogenesis ) in which the placental cytotrophoblasts convert from an epithelial to an endothelial phenotype during normal fetal development. Failure of placental angiogenesis and pseudovasculogenesis during placental development has been linked to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. It currently is believed that soluble factors released by the diseased placenta lead to clinical findings of preeclampsia. This article discusses placental vascular development in health and in disease, with a focus on accumulating recent evidence that the maternal clinical syndrome of preeclampsia is an antiangiogenic state resulting from an excess of anti-endothelial factors liberated by the diseased placenta.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To assess the effect of smoking on the incidence of pre-eclampsia and on perinatal outcome in twin pregnancy. Design: Retrospective study using Aberdeen Maternity and Neonatal Databank. Setting: Grampian, Orkney and Shetland. Population: All 1,575 twin pregnancies delivered in the years 1969-1971 and 1976-1997 (when smoking data were available). Methods: In all twin pregnancies the effects of smoking on pre-eclampsia were analysed by parity and gestation at delivery. The effect of smoking upon late miscarriage and perinatal outcome was analysed without subdivision. Main outcome measures: Pre-eclampsia and perinatal outcome. Results: Primiparae had significantly higher rates of pre-eclampsia than multiparae and were delivered significantly earlier. The incidence of pre-eclampsia in smokers was significantly lower only in multiparae. Length of gestation was significantly shorter in multiparous smokers. The effect of smoking on pre-eclampsia appeared to be direct in multiparae but possibly indirect in primiparae (by causing earlier delivery). Smokers had a higher late miscarriage rate than nonsmokers. Conclusions: In twin pregnancy the apparent protective effect of smoking against pre-eclampsia is significant only in multiparae, suggesting that in primiparae the smoking effect is overwhelmed by the other reasons for the development of pre-eclampsia. Smoking in twin pregnancy is not recommended due to the worse fetal outcome rates.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: The soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) to placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio is generally elevated some time before and at the clinical onset of pre-eclampsia. The PROGNOSIS study validated a sFlt-1/PlGF ratio cut-off of ≤ 38 to rule out the onset of pre-eclampsia within 1 week of testing in women with suspected disease. The aim of this study was to assess the predictive value of the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio to rule out the onset of pre-eclampsia for up to 4 weeks, and to assess the value of repeat measurements. Methods: This was an exploratory post-hoc analysis of data from the PROGNOSIS study performed in pregnant women aged ≥ 18 years with suspected pre-eclampsia, who were at 24 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks' gestation at their first clinic visit. Serum samples were collected at the first visit and weekly thereafter. sFlt-1 and PlGF levels were measured using Elecsys® sFlt-1 and PlGF immunoassays. Whether the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio cut-off of ≤ 38 used to rule out the onset of pre-eclampsia within 1 week could predict the absence of pre-eclampsia 2, 3, and 4 weeks post-baseline was assessed. The value of repeat sFlt-1/PlGF testing was assessed by examining the difference in sFlt-1/PlGF ratio 2 and 3 weeks after the first measurement in women with, and those without, pre-eclampsia or adverse fetal outcome. Results: On analysis of 550 women, sFlt-1/PlGF ratio ≤ 38 ruled out the onset of pre-eclampsia 2 and 3 weeks post-baseline with high negative predictive values (NPV) of 97.9% and 95.7%, respectively. The onset of pre-eclampsia within 4 weeks was ruled out with a high NPV (94.3%) and high sensitivity and specificity (66.2% and 83.1%, respectively). Compared with women who did not develop pre-eclampsia, those who developed pre-eclampsia had significantly larger median increases in sFlt-1/PlGF ratio at 2 weeks (∆, 31.22 vs 1.45; P < 0.001) and at 3 weeks (∆, 48.97 vs 2.39; P < 0.001) after their initial visit. Women who developed pre-eclampsia and/or adverse fetal outcome compared with those who did not had a significantly greater median increase in sFlt-1/PlGF ratio over the same period (∆, 21.22 vs 1.40; P < 0.001 at 2 weeks; ∆, 34.95 vs 2.30; P < 0.001 at 3 weeks). Conclusion: The Elecsys® immunoassay sFlt-1/PlGF ratio can help to rule out the onset of pre-eclampsia for 4 weeks in women with suspected pre-eclampsia. © 2018 The Authors.

"Predicting PE would enable a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms responsible for this disease. It would also permit the identification of an at-risk population and consequently ease the set up of clinical trials. Over 12,000 articles have been published on this subject. Critical review of the literature reveals that none of the investigations, performed individually, bears sufficient predictive value. However, it appears that the current tendency is to apply a combined approach associating clinical, ultrasonographic and biological factors.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To investigate the placenta perfusion in pre-eclampsia by three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound and analysing the clinical outcome. Method: 80 cases of normal and pre-eclampsia pregnant women from July 2007 to May 2008 in Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital were studied. The control group of 36 cases, pre-eclampsia were divided into three groups: a total of 44 cases, mild pre-eclampsia group (9 cases), severe pre-eclampsia group (26 cases) and chronic hypertension with pre-eclampsia group (9 cases). The placental vascular index (VI), flow index (FI), blood vessels and blood flow index (VFI) by three-dimensional Doppler histogram and the umbilical blood flow systolic to diastolic (S/D) by color Doppler flow imaging were calculated and the gestational age after delivery, birth weight, placental weight after birth were recorded respectively. Results: (1) VI, FI, VFI and umbilical blood flow S/D value: 6.3+/-2.9, 38.6+/-4.4, 2.7+/-1.3, 2.5+/-0.6 in normal group; 5.7+/-3.8, 36.3+/-7.2, 2.4+/-2.0, 2.4+/-0.3 in mild pre-eclampsia group; 3.0+/-2.4, 31.7+/-5.0, 1.1+/-1.0, 2.9+/-1.3 in severe pre-eclampsia group; 2.2+/-1.6, 26.1+/-4.4, 0.8+/-0.6, 3.1+/-1.6 in chronic hypertension with pre-eclampsia group. Placenta of normal group and mild preeclampsia group VI, FI, VFI were no significant difference (P>0.05), placental VI, FI, VFI of severe preeclampsia group and chronic hypertension with severe pre-eclampsia group were significantly lower than the normal group (P<0.01) and than mild pre-eclampsia group (P<0.05). The umbilical blood flows were not obvious difference among four groups (P>0.05); (2) Gestational age after birth, birth weight, low newborn weight rate and placental weight: (38.7+/-1.5) weeks, (3280+/-520) g, 3%, (568+/-141) g in normal group; (37.9+/-1.0) weeks, (2971+/-265) g, 0, (576+/-98) g in mild pre-eclampsia group; (33.2+/-2.6) weeks, (1820+/-737) g, 58%, (458+/-154) g in severe pre-eclampsia group; (32.6+/-2.6) weeks, (1497+/-533) g, 7/9, (396+/-141) g in chronic hypertension with pre-eclampsia group. The normal group and mild pre-eclampsia group in gestational age after birth, birth weight, low newborn weight rate and placental weight were not significant difference (P>0.05); severe pre-eclampsia and chronic hypertension with severe pre-eclampsia group in them were significantly lower than the normal group (P<0.01) and than mild pre-eclampsia group (P<0.05). Conclusions: (1) Placental blood flow perfusion of the severe pre-eclampsia and pre-eclampsia with chronic hypertension of pregnancy decreased resulting in clinically lower placental weight, birth weight and gestational age at delivery, but there were no obvious differences in umbilical blood flow S/D values. (2) The investigation was helpful to clinical diagnosis in the placenta perfusion of pre-eclampsia by three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound.",preeclampsia
"This consensus report focuses the presentation, pathophysiology, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy expanding on recommendations first presented in 1988 by the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Practicing physicians should determine whether a patient's hypertension during pregnancy falls into the classification of (1) chronic hypertension, (2) preeclampsia, (3) preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension, or (4) transient hypertension. The distinction, for management considerations, is made between hypertension that is present before pregnancy (chronic and preexisting) and that occurring as part of the pregnancy-specific condition preeclampsia. When maternal blood pressure reaches diastolic levels of 100 mm Hg or greater, treatment should be instituted to avoid hypertensive vascular damage. The report includes a discussion of antihypertensive therapy specific to the chronic or acute hypertension occurring concomitantly with pregnancy. The roles of calcium supplementation and low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia and chronic and transient hypertension are under investigation.",preeclampsia
"The aim of this study was to examine whether differences in placental angiotensinase A (glutamyl aminopeptidase, EC 3.4.11.7) activities occurred in hypertensive complications of pregnancy compared with uncomplicated pregnancies. Biochemical and semiquantitative histochemical methods were used and compared for their applicability. Angiotensinase A activity was detected using L-alpha glutamyl-4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide (alpha-Glu-MNA) as substrate and Fast Blue B salt for simultaneous azo-coupling in cryostat sections of placental tissue samples from 32 patients with pre-eclampsia, 11 patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension and 44 participants with uncomplicated pregnancies. The graduated intensity of reaction product in the villous trophoblast and in fetal blood vessels was evaluated semiquantitatively in a double-blind study by light microscopy (semiquantitative score method). Score levels were related to relative frequencies of hypertensive disorders (proportional odds model) and correlated to the severity of gestational hypertension (Spearman's rank correlation). After detection of enzyme activity, the same tissue samples were homogenized and used for kinetic fluorometric measurements under the same substrate and buffer conditions as in enzyme histochemistry. Enhanced villous trophoblastic angiotensinase A activity was significantly associated with an increased frequency of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women (cumulative odds ratio x 0(1) 6.37; P < 0.001) and showed significant correlations with the severity of gestational hypertensive disorders, represented by systolic (r = 0.31; P < 0.05) and diastolic (r = 0.34; P < 0.05 blood pressure and by concomitant proteinuria (r = 044; P < 0.01). Histochemical evaluation of fetal blood vessels and biochemical measurements revealed no statistically significant results. In conclusion this study demonstrates for the first time that increased villous trophoblastic angiotensinase A activity indicates an increased likelihood of the presence of pre-eclampsia and the severity of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"Familial predisposition and patterns of genetic inheritance of eclampsia and pre-eclampsia were investigated through three or four generations in 94 families from the homogenous island population of Iceland. The families descended from index women delivered in the years 1931-47 and who had either eclampsia (n = 38) or severe pre-eclampsia (n = 69). Inheritance was followed both through sons and daughters. The prevalence of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in daughters was significantly higher (23%) than that in daughters-in-law (10%). No difference was noted in the prevalence of these diseases by whether the daughter was born of an eclamptic or pre-eclamptic mother or whether she was a first or later born daughter. There was a non-significantly higher occurrence of pre-eclampsia among grand-daughters than in grand-daughters-in-law. No difference was seen by whether grand-daughters descended through sons or daughters. With increasing numbers of affected daughters or grand-daughters the probability rose of finding more affected women in a family. Hypotheses of single recessive and dominant gene inheritance were compared and maximum likelihood estimates for gene frequency obtained. For a single recessive gene model this was 0.31 reflecting a population prevalence of 9.6%, whereas a dominant model with incomplete penetrance gave 0.14 at 48% gene penetrance, corresponding to a population prevalence of 0.9% homozygous expression of severe disease and 11% heterozygous expression of milder disease. Either genetic model could fit the data.",preeclampsia
Objective: A plasma platelet aggregation factor (PAF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of platelet activation in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Similar mechanism may be operative in pre-eclampsia. Methods: Coagulation profile and detailed in vitro platelet aggregation with various agonists were studied. PAF was demonstrated by spontaneous aggregation of normal platelets with test plasma. Non-parametric Wilcoxon's rank sum test and Krauskal Wally's one way analysis of variance were applied. Result: Twenty-two pre-eclamptic patients and 20 normal pregnant controls were studied. Anti-thrombin III levels were within normal range and fibrin degradation products were only border line raised ( > 10 < 40 micrograms/ml) in 14 (65.4%) patients. In vitro platelet aggregation was abnormal in 17 (77.2%) patients. PAF was demonstrable in 10 of 22 (45.5%) patients. Conclusion: Platelet aggregation studies indicated the presence of both activated (hyperaggregable) as well as exhausted (hypoaggregable) platelets in circulation. PAF demonstrable in 45.4% pre-eclampsia patients would suggest its role in the pathogenetic mechanism of platelet activation in this disease.,preeclampsia
"Objective: To evaluate the relationship of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) with proteinuria and blood pressure level in patients with pre-eclampsia and to investigate whether or not NLR has a role in predicting the severity of pre-eclampsia. Study design: The study comprised 30 healthy pregnant females (Group 1), 37 females with mild pre-eclampsia (Group 2) and 40 with severe pre-eclampsia (Group 3). All the study participants were statistically compared in respect of demographic data, proteinuria levels, and blood pressure levels. Result: Age, body mass index, and gestational weeks were similar in all the groups. Maternal NLR was determined to be significantly high in the pre-eclamptic patients (Groups 2 and 3) compared to the healthy pregnant patients (Group 1) (p=0.017). NLR was significantly higher in the severe pre-eclampsia group than in the mild pre-eclampsia group (p=0.032). A significant positive correlation was determined in correlation analysis between NLR and proteinuria (p=0.013, r=0.319). There was also a significant and positive correlation between NLR and systolic/diastolic arterial pressure (p=0.007, r=0.285; p=0.044, r=0.213, respectively). Conclusion: In conclusion, while NLR was determined as significantly high in patients with pre-eclampsia, to be able to use this in the classification of the severity of pre-eclampsia, there is a need for further studies on a more extensive population.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia is characterized by an increase in high blood pressure and decrease in GFR and proteinuria, however, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Renalase is a recently discovered protein implicated in regulation of blood pressure in humans. Materials and methods: Plasma concentrations of serum renalase were measured in healthy controls, healthy pregnant and pregnant with preeclampsia matched for age, gestational age, in the third trimester of pregnancy. Serum renalase levels were compared in pregnant with and without preeclampsia and non-pregnant controls. Factors associated with serum renalase levels in pregnancies were also evaluated. Results: In healthy pregnant serum renalase levels were significantly higher than in controls. However, pregnant with preeclampsia had lower renalase levels than healthy controls. Serum renalase levels were inversely associated with blood pressure levels and positively correlated with glomerular filtration rate. Conclusion: The results indicated that the development of preeclampsia in pregnant is accompanied by altered serum renalase levels. High blood pressure and kidney damage that characterize this disorder are mediated at least in part by low renalase levels.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive disorders (gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, superimposed preeclampsia) are the most common medical complications of pregnancy and constitute a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Prediction of those women destined to develop preeclampsia remains elusive. The benefits of calcium supplementation for prevention of preeclampsia are encouraging; however, the definitive study is not yet complete. Aspirin therapy for high-risk has not been helpful; results of therapy for high-risk women are pending. More experience is being gained with antihypertensive therapy and expectant management in severe preeclampsia. Conservative management of severe preeclampsia, when performed in a tertiary care center, may benefit a select group of women and their fetuses.",preeclampsia
"Background: Early-onset pre-eclampsia is an important cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and is believed to have a significant impact on future maternal physical and psychological health. However, structured follow-up data of women with a history of early-onset pre-eclampsia are lacking. This study aims to present comprehensive data of a large cohort of women with a history of early-onset pre-eclampsia with respect to future reproductive health, family planning and subsequent pregnancy rates. Methods: A tertiary referral cohort of 304 women entered the follow-up study at 6-12 months after their first delivery. Detailed data on maternal and neonatal outcomes, family planning and subsequent pregnancies were recorded. In addition, data on perspectives, major concerns and decision-making of women who had not achieved a second pregnancy were collected by questionnaire and structured interviews. Data were compared with a population of 268 low-risk primiparous women with an uncomplicated delivery. Results: At a mean of 5.5 years after first delivery, 65.8% of women with a history of early-onset pre-eclampsia had achieved a second pregnancy compared with 77.6% of healthy controls. At follow-up, 19.1% of women with a history of early-onset pre-eclampsia had an active wish to become pregnant, whereas 15.1% of women did not wish to achieve a future pregnancy. In the latter group, decision-making was most commonly influenced by fear of recurrent disease (33%) and fear of delivering another premature child (33%) among others reasons, e.g. post-partum counseling and concerns of the partner. Conclusions: The majority of women with a history of early-onset pre-eclampsia achieve or wish to achieve a second pregnancy within a few years of their delivery. Nonetheless, first pregnancy early-onset pre-eclampsia appears to have a significant impact on future reproductive health and decision-making, emphasizing the importance of careful post-partum counseling.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, is a multifactorial disease caused by complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors. A recent genome-wide association study of blood pressure reported an association between hypertension and rs11646213. This study evaluated the association between preeclampsia and rs11646213. Methods: A total of 454 cases and 460 controls were recruited to participate in this study. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11646213 was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. Results: The allele frequency of rs11646213 was significantly different between the preeclampsia and control groups (P = 0.017, OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.06-1.76). Differences were particularly significant in the severe preeclampsia subgroup (P = 0.002, OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.17-2.03) and the early-onset preeclampsia subgroup (P = 0.004, OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.16-2.13). Genotyping analysis showed that the T allele of rs11646213 could confer a risk for preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia and early-onset preeclampsia. Conclusions: Rs11646213 upstream of the CDH13 gene is associated with preeclampsia in Han Chinese women.",preeclampsia
"Background: We present the case of very early onset pre-eclampsia, possibly aggravated by liquorice consumption. Case: An 18-year-old healthy primigravida presented with high blood pressure and proteinuria at 18 weeks gestation. She had a strong family history of pre-eclampsia and was consuming considerable amounts of liquorice. A diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia/hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count was confirmed. The pregnancy was terminated. Extensive investigation ruled out underlying diseases and autopsy revealed a normal fetus. In three consequtive pregnancies, she developed milder forms of pre-eclampsia. Conclusion: In healthy women with a familial/genetic susceptibility for pre-eclampsia, liquorice consumption may aggravate the course of the disease.",preeclampsia
"Purpose of review: Preeclampsia, one of the leading causes of pregnancy complications, affects 3-7% of pregnant women. This review summarizes the present knowledge of a new potential cause of the disease and suggests a method for its prediction/diagnosis and a possible treatment, both based on the recent findings on the involvement of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and the heme and radical scavenging protein A1M (alpha-1-microglobulin). Recent findings: Gene and protein profiling studies have independently shown that increased amount of free HbF is accumulated in the preeclampsia placenta. As a result of a predominantly oxidative damage to the blood-placenta barrier, HbF leaks over to the maternal blood circulation. Elevated levels can be measured already in the first trimester, and later in pregnancy, the levels correlate with the blood pressure in women with preeclampsia. Ex-vivo data show that the human protein A1M, an endogeneous antioxidation protection protein, can prevent Hb-induced damage to the placenta, restore the blood-placental barrier and prevent maternal tissue damage. Summary: Free HbF may provide both a predictive and a diagnostic clinical biomarker from the first trimester. A1M has the potential as a future pharmacological treatment for preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Aims: To determine the epidemio-clinical profile of severe pre-eclampsia. Patients and method: It was about a transversal study done from November 2005 to juin 2006 at the teaching hospital Gabriel Touré. Were included pregnant women with severe pre-eclampsia. Statistical analysis compared the proportions and means, the proportions were compared using the chi (2 with) P < 0,05 considered significant. Results: during the period of study, 130 cares of severe pré-eclamsia were brougthbto gether among 1667 pregnant women, which was 7,8 %.The mean age was 17.15 years with extremes of 15 and 42 years. The most frequent signs of severe preeclampsia were the association of epigastrium pain, nausea, vomiting and headaches in 54- 62 %. Conclusion: Ther profile type severe pre-eclampsia is 17 years old pregnant women, of an uterus height between 33 and 36 cm, with an insuffisant number of prenatal consultation.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder, complicating 2 - 8% of pregnancies, and represents a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Recent investigations have elucidated the understanding of its underlying pathogenic mechanisms. However, despite these advances, therapeutic approaches are still severely limited. Ongoing lines of research indicate some potential novel therapeutic options, targeting the etiopathogenic pathways and, thus, offering hope for effective pharmacologic interventions to be available in the near future. In this editorial, we will give an updated overview of Preeclampsia pathogenesis and promising emerging therapeutic options.",preeclampsia
"Aims/hypothesis: Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder and a state of physiological insulin resistance. Our aim was to systematically evaluate and quantify the evidence on the relationship between pre-eclampsia and the future risk of diabetes. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that evaluated diabetes in women with and without pre-eclampsia. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify relevant studies. Independent double data extractions were conducted by four reviewers. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the risk of future diabetes following pre-eclampsia. Results: A total of 21 studies were identified with more than 2.8 million women, including more than 72,500 women with pre-eclampsia. Meta-analysis of studies that adjusted for potential confounders demonstrated that pre-eclampsia was independently associated with an increased risk of future diabetes (RR 2.37 [95% CI 1.89, 2.97]). This risk appeared in studies that followed women from less than 1 year postpartum (RR 1.97 [95% CI 1.35, 2.87]) and persisted to more than 10 years postpartum (RR 1.95 [95% CI 1.28, 2.97]). After adjusting for BMI or gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia remained linked with an increased risk of future diabetes (RR 2.38 [95% CI 1.74, 3.24] and RR 2.36 [95% CI 1.94, 2.88], respectively). Conclusions/interpretation: Pre-eclampsia is independently associated with a twofold increase in future diabetes. Our study highlights the importance of clinical risk assessment for the future development of diabetes in women with pre-eclampsia. We recommend detailed evaluation of a screening programme for diabetes in this high-risk population.",preeclampsia
"A follow up study of 84 patients with early onset pre-eclampsia (before 37 weeks' gestation) showed a high prevalence of underlying renal disease. Renal abnormalities were found in 33 of the 49 primiparas (67%) and in 22 of the 35 multiparas (63%). Two thirds of the multiparas with pre-eclampsia before 37 weeks with a diagnosis of either essential hypertension or renal disease had recurrent pre-eclampsia. Maternal morbidity and fetal mortality were greater in the group with early onset pre-eclampsia than in a group with late onset disease. Idiopathic pre-eclampsia occurred in 10% of primiparas in the early onset group, whereas it was the main condition in over three quarters of primiparas in the late onset group. A presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic pre-eclampsia is likely to be correct only in primiparas who develop the disease after 37 weeks of pregnancy; in all other cases careful search will almost certainly detect an underlying abnormality, predominantly renal.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To assess the effect of low dose aspirin on severe pre-eclampsia when given to women identified as high risk by abnormal uterine artery Doppler ultrasound. Design: Women with abnormal uterine artery flow velocity waveforms were recruited to the CLASP trial at 24 weeks. Abnormal uterine artery waveforms, with a high resistance index or an early diastolic notch, were identified at the 18-22 week anomaly scan and confirmed at 24 weeks. Of those women with persistently abnormal waveforms, 63 agreed to enter the CLASP trial. Three women were lost to follow up and five did not comply. Thus, 60 were randomised: 29 to placebo and 31 to low dose aspirin (60 mg daily) and analysis by intention to treat is reported. Results: There were nine cases (29%) of pre-eclampsia in the aspirin group and twelve (41%) in the placebo group (odds ratio (OR) 0-58, confidence interval (CI) 0.2-1.69, P = 0.32). Severe pre-eclampsia developed in four women in the aspirin group and eleven women in the placebo group (OR 0.24, CI 0.07-0.88, P = 0.03) and intrauterine growth retardation occurred in eight cases in the aspirin group and twelve in the placebo group (OR 0.49, CI 0.17-1.47). The mean birthweight and gestation at delivery were 2.69 kg and 38.5 weeks in the aspirin group and 2.38 kg and 37.4 weeks in the placebo group, neither of which were statistically significant using the unpaired t test; P = 0.09 and P = 0.23, respectively. Conclusion: In high risk pregnancy low dose aspirin commenced at 24 weeks may reduce the incidence of severe pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia (PE) is a complex disorder that affects 3-5% of all pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. To date, the heterogeneity of clinical presentation, disease severity and outcomes have limited significant advances in early prediction, diagnosis, and therapeutic intervention of PE. The rapidly expanding field of metabolomics, which has the capacity to quantitatively detect low molecular weight compounds (metabolites) in tissue and biological fluids, shows tremendous promise in gaining a better understanding of PE. This review will discuss this emerging field and its contribution to recent advances in the understanding of PE pathophysiology, and identification of early predictive metabolic biomarkers for this complex disorder.",preeclampsia
"Controversy continues over the mode of delivery in severe pre-eclampsia remote from term. The aim of this study was to assess prospectively the mode of delivery in severe pre-eclampsia remote from term. The clinical data of 108 women who presented consecutively with severe pre-eclampsia over a 1-year period was used for the study material. Sixty-eight (63%) patients were delivered by elective caesarean section and 40 (37%) underwent induction of labour. Twenty-six had a vaginal delivery following induction, the others (n = 14) had emergency caesarean section. No baby with a gestational age of < or = 27 weeks survived after delivery. Perinatal mortality was highest for the babies delivered following induction of labour (vaginal delivery vs. caesarean section after induction of labour, P = 0.0004; vaginal delivery vs. elective caesarean section, P = 0.002). Severe pre-eclampsia remote from term is associated with a high caesarean section rate. In this study, carried out in a developing country, elective caesarean section contributed to a better perinatal outcome than vaginal delivery or emergency caesarean section following induction of labour.",preeclampsia
"Background: The involvement of the placenta in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome is well established, and placental lesions are also similar in these two syndromes. Here we aimed to examine the placental transcriptome and to identify candidate biomarkers in early-onset preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. Methods: Placental specimens were obtained at C-sections from women with early-onset preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome, and from controls who delivered preterm or at term. After histopathological examination, fresh-frozen placental specimens were used for microarray profiling and validation by qRT-PCR. Differential expression was analysed using log-linear models while adjusting for gestational age. Gene ontology and pathway analyses were used to interpret gene expression changes. Tissue microarrays were constructed from paraffin-embedded placental specimens and immunostained. Results: Placental gene expression was gestational age-dependent among preterm and term controls. Out of the 350 differentially expressed genes in preeclampsia and 554 genes in HELLP syndrome, 224 genes (including LEP, CGB, LHB, INHA, SIGLEC6, PAPPA2, TREM1, and FLT1) changed in the same direction (elevated or reduced) in both syndromes. Many of these encode proteins that have been implicated as biomarkers for preeclampsia. Enrichment analyses revealed similar biological processes, cellular compartments and biological pathways enriched in early-onset preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome; however, some processes and pathways (e.g., cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction) were over-represented only in HELLP syndrome. Conclusion: High-throughput transcriptional and tissue microarray expression profiling revealed that placental transcriptomes of early-onset preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome largely overlap, underlying a potential common cause and pathophysiologic processes in these syndromes. However, gene expression changes may also suggest a more severe placental pathology and pronounced inflammatory response in HELLP syndrome than in preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Introduction: The experience of normal pregnancy is often disrupted for women with preeclampsia (PE). Materials and methods: Postal survey of the 112 members of the consumer group, Australian Action on Pre-Eclampsia (AAPEC). Results: Surveys were returned by 68 women (61% response rate) and from 64 (57%) partners, close relatives or friends. Respondents reported experiencing pre-eclampsia (n = 53), eclampsia (n = 5), and/or Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets (HELLP syndrome) (n = 26). Many women had no knowledge of PE prior to diagnosis (77%) and, once diagnosed, did not appreciate how serious or life threatening it was (50%). Women wanted access to information about PE. Their experience contributed substantial anxiety towards future pregnancies. Partners/friends/relatives expressed fear for the woman and/or her baby and had no prior understanding of PE. Conclusions: The PE experience had a substantial effect on women, their confidants, and their babies and affected their approach to future pregnancies. Access to information about PE was viewed as very important.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a disorder that occurs only during pregnancy and the postpartum period and affects both the mother and the unborn child. Affecting at least 5-8% of all pregnancies, it can be a rapidly progressive condition characterised by hypertension and proteinuria. Oedema, sudden weight gain, headaches and changes in vision are important symptoms. However, some women with rapidly advancing disease report few symptoms.",preeclampsia
"The human tumor-associated antigen RCAS1 (receptor-binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells) is considered to play a role in the escape of tumor cells from immune surveillance and, at the same time, participates in the inhibition of the maternal immune response during pregnancy. The aim of our study was to investigate the expression of tumor-associated RCAS1 protein in the placenta and amniotic membranes and to assess and compare its concentration in amniotic fluid, maternal and cord blood sera in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia. Samples were obtained from women with pre-eclampsia (N=9), pre-eclampsia with IUGR (N=4), normotensive IUGR (N=7) and healthy term controls (N=25) after delivery. Placentas were studied by immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis and real-time (RT)-PCR. For assessment of RCAS1 protein concentrations in biological fluids, ELISA was performed. RCAS1 mRNA expression in the placentas of pre-eclamptic patients was significantly lower than in controls (p<0.01). The maternal blood serum RCAS1 protein concentration in the pre-eclampsia cases was also significantly lower than in controls (p=0.0207). The other study groups did not differ significantly. This study reveals the possible role of the RCAS1 protein in the development of pre-eclampsia through an immunological pathway.",preeclampsia
"The records of 2,671 pregnancies were reviewed regarding maternal obesity, excessive weight gain in pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is significantly more frequent in maternal obesity. Correlation between excessive weight gain in pregnancy and pre-eclampsia is only found for the signs of edema and hypertension. Edema and excessive weight gain in pregnancy are related to each other, since edema frequently induces the excessive weight gain. Overall, maternal obesity perior to pregnancy is much more important in the development of pre-eclampsia than excessive weight gain during pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"In addition to hypertension and proteinuria, generalized edema is seen commonly in women with severe preeclampsia. A patient presented to us at term with the complaint of dysphonia. Upon examination she appeared to be clearly preeclamptic and had a grossly edemetous uvula, which we think occurred secondary to generalized edema. This case might be the first reported one of preeclampsia presenting as dysphonia and of uvular edema in association with preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: The aim of this study was to identify important transcription factors (TFs) in preeclampsia. Methods: Fisher's test was applied to identify differentially expressed pathways. Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) was applied to identify differential expressed genes (DEGs). Topological characterizations of TFs were analyzed to identify key TFs. Results: From the DEG group, 37 genes were identified as TFs, and a total of 10 significant TFs with adjusted p<0.05 were identified. A total of 17 key TFs were identified from the TF network. Conclusions: Seventeen key TFs were identified, which may provide new insights into the mechanism of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Chronic hypertension affects up to 5% of pregnancies. Women can be stratified into low-risk or high-risk chronic hypertension based on baseline laboratory and diagnostic work-up, comorbid conditions, and outcomes in prior pregnancies. Pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension are at risk for increased adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes including superimposed preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, and perinatal death. Mainstays of management include blood pressure control, close monitoring for development of superimposed preeclampsia, serial ultrasound assessment of fetal growth, and antenatal testing after 32 weeks.",preeclampsia
"Cigarette smoking adversely affects every organ system. Paradoxically, smoking during pregnancy has been associated with a reduced risk of preeclampsia. We reviewed previous epidemiologic and clinical studies on the association between smoking and preeclampsia from 1959 to March, 2006. A total of 48 epidemiologic studies were identified. Overall, smoking during pregnancy reduces the risk of preeclampsia by up to 50% with a dose-response pattern. A protective effect was consistently found in both nulliparas and multiparas, singleton and multifetal pregnancies, and for mild and severe preeclampsia. Evidence on whether quitting smoking before or in early pregnancy reduces the risk remains inconclusive. To understand possible biologic mechanism(s) of the protective effect, we reviewed literature on potential pathophysiology of smoking and its effects on placenta, cardiovascular and immune systems. Although current literature does not lend clear evidence to support a particular mechanism for the protective effect of smoking, smoking might have effects on angiogenic factors, endothelial function and the immune system which act to lower risk of preeclampsia. More epidemiologic studies with biochemically confirmed smoking status and laboratory studies with a focus on promising pathways are warranted to further clarify this puzzling relationship. Understanding the underlying mechanisms through which smoking reduces preeclampsia risk may enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder and contribute to the development of prevention strategies.",preeclampsia
"Background: Many abnormalities are known to occur in the microcirculation in essential hypertension, including reduction in capillary density or rarefaction. Peripheral vasodilatation and angiogenesis are critical components of the physiological adaptation in normal pregnancy. Objective: To investigate the hypothesis that defective angiogenesis, reflected in capillary rarefaction, may be implicated in the clinical syndrome of pre-eclampsia. Methods: We used intravital capillary video-microscopy to study functional (baseline) and structural (after maximization with venous congestion) skin capillary density in 22 healthy normotensive pregnant women and compared our findings with those in 22 non-pregnant age-matched healthy controls and 11 women whose pregnancies were complicated by pre-eclampsia. Results: We found that both functional and structural capillary density increased during normal pregnancy. Capillary density in pre-eclamptic women was significantly lower both at baseline and after maximization. Skin capillary density appeared to be inversely correlated with blood pressure during pregnancy and in pre-eclampsia. Conclusions: A low capillary density may account, in part, for the failure of blood pressure to decrease in pre-eclamptic pregnancies, and may reflect the maladaptive cardiovascular response that is part of the pre-eclampsia syndrome.",preeclampsia
"The incidence of pre-eclampsia in a second pregnancy has been studied in 6,637 women for Aberdeen City whose pregnancies occurred between 1969 and 1978. The rate of pre-eclampsia in second pregnancy is less than in first pregnancy, but this is altered by the outcome of the first pregnancy with reference to length of gestation, occurrence of pre-eclampsia and abortion.",preeclampsia
"Oocyte donation (OD) is a specific method of artificial reproductive technology that is accompanied by a higher risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying preeclampsia in OD pregnancies is thought to differ from preeclampsia in autologous pregnancies. As preeclampsia in autologous pregnancies is suggested to be associated with complement activation, we studied C4d deposition, circulating complement components and placental complement regulatory proteins in preeclamptic OD pregnancies. Women with uncomplicated and preeclamptic pregnancies after OD or spontaneous conception were selected. We stained the placentas for C4d, marker for complement activation, measured complement factors C1q, C3 and C4 in maternal sera and quantified the placental mRNA expression of complement regulatory proteins CD46, CD55 and CD59. A significantly (p < 0.03) higher incidence of C4d deposition was observed in placentas from women with preeclampsia compared with uncomplicated pregnancies, both OD and autologous. The level of complement factors in serum did not differ between the groups. Children born in the autologous preeclampsia group were significantly lower in birth weight (p < 10th percentile) compared with the preeclamptic OD group. In addition, the placental mRNA expression level of complement regulatory proteins was significantly lower in uncomplicated and preeclamptic OD compared with the autologous pregnancies. In line with autologous preeclampsia pregnancies, there is excessive activation of complement in preeclamptic OD pregnancies. However, in contrast to autologous pregnancies this is not associated with counterbalancing upregulation of complement regulatory proteins. Furthermore, C4d deposition in OD pregnancies is not related to the severity of preeclampsia, suggesting another trigger or regulatory mechanism of placental C4d deposition in preeclamptic OD pregnancies.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is one of the most serious pregnancy - specific medical conditions of increasing incidence. It remains a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Although maternal mortality is especially high in developing countries, preeclampsia and its complications are one of the top four causes of maternal deaths even in developed societies. Unfortunately, yet the only effective and definitive treatment of preeclampsia is delivery of the baby and placenta, and its time depends on the disease severity and gestational age. In this review, we report principles of management of preeclampsia in the light of current international recommendations. Suggested failure of the placental development and significant role of angiogenic factors and their receptors in etiology of preeclampsia give the possibility for their future use in diagnosis and risk assessment of the disease and open new chapter of possible solutions also in the field of treatment of this serious pregnancy complication. Introduction of an advanced form of therapy that could safely prolong the duration of pregnancy would be invaluable in the area of preeclampsia management and lowering perinatal complications, especially in women with early-onset severe preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: The aim of this work is to assess the most widespread methods currently proposed and two new markers for predicting the development of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women with hypertension. Methods: The study involved 212 pregnant Caucasian women: 104 normotensive, 68 pregnancy-induced hypertensive and 40 chronic hypertensive. Blood and urine were sampled between 28 and 30 weeks gestation. All 108 hypertensive pregnant women, at the time of sampling, demonstrated proteinuria below 0.3 g/24 h. The following laboratory tests were performed: fibronectin, antithrombin-III, alpha-1-microglobulin, U-N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, uric acid and albumin excretion rate. Student's t-test, discriminant analysis and chi2 (chi-square) test were used as statistical methods. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: After discriminating analysis, only three of the six variables analyzed were able to discriminate patients who would develop pre-eclampsia from the remaining hypertensive pregnant women: microalbuminuria, uric acid and fibronectin (chi2 = 29.122, P < 0.01). Conclusions: In agreement with previous studies, albumin excretion rate appeared to be the best predictive test for pre-eclampsia in hypertensive pregnant women, giving a higher positive predictive value and specificity (87.5 and 98.9%, respectively).",preeclampsia
"Objective: The role of proteoglycans (PGs) of the umbilical cord arteries (UCAs) in the pathomechanism of pre-eclampsia is not known. Therefore we decided to compare the PGs of normal (control) UCAs and those of newborns delivered by mothers with pre-eclampsia. Methods: PGs were extracted in dissociative conditions, purified by Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography and lyophilized. They were analyzed by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE before and after treatment with chondroitinase ABC. Results: It was found that the PG preparation from pre-eclamptic UCAs had a higher amount of sulphated glycosaminoglycans (in relation to protein) than in the case of control UCAs. The predominant PG fraction included small PGs with core proteins of 45 and 47 kD, immunologically related to biglycan (45 kD) and decorin (45 and 47 kD). The expression of decorin core proteins was increased and that of biglycan slightly decreased in pre-eclamptic UCAs. Some other putative small PG core proteins (56, 53, 49, 42, 38 and 34 kD) were also found. They were present in higher amounts in pre-eclamptic UCAs. Larger PGs (core proteins of 99-110 and >150 kD), were detected in lower amounts, both in control and particularly in pre-eclamptic material. Conclusion: Pre-eclampsia is associated with alterations in PG composition of the UCAs. They may affect the mechanical properties of this organ and disturb fetal blood circulation.",preeclampsia
Two meta-analyses suggest that low-dose aspirin taken daily during pregnancy reduces the incidence of pre-eclampsia in women at risk and reduces mortality among the infants born to mothers at high risk of pre-eclampsia.,preeclampsia
"The pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia, disease of the endothelium, placental ischaemia, and its consequences on blood pressure and heart rate variations are described. The methods of evaluation of heart rate and blood pressure during pregnancy, outpatient visit clinical measurement, self-measurement, ambulatory measurement, ""Finapres"", electrocardiogram and Holter ECG are reviewed; the practical implications of the nocturnal fall of vagal tone with tachycardia, demonstrated during pre-eclampsia, are discussed.",preeclampsia
"Purpose: Pregnancy is a known predisposing factor for central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). Choroidal thickness (CT) increases in patients with CSC. This study was designed to evaluate CT in pregnant women.Patients and methodsThis was a prospective study. Fourteen healthy pregnant women and seven patients with pre-eclampsia were included. Twenty-one normal subjects were also recruited. CT was measured using enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography. Results: The mean CT of normal subjects, healthy pregnant women and patients with pre-eclampsia were 264.95±21.03, 274.23±29.30 and 389.79±25.13 μm, respectively (normal subjects vs healthy gravidas: P>0.05; normal subjects vs pre-eclampsia: P<0.001; healthy gravidas vs pre-eclampsia: P<0.001). CT decreased from 381.05±22.96 μm to 335.17±9.97 μm 1 week after delivery in patients with pre-eclampsia. Conclusions: Pregnancy itself did not increase CT, whereas pre-eclampsia did appear to result in increased CT. This suggests that additional unknown factors induce hyperpermeability in pregnant women.",preeclampsia
"The influences of uterine contractions and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) infusion on blood pressure evaluation of the pre-eclamptic patient in labor have not been thoroughly investigated. Blood pressures were measured between and during contractions in 13 patients with pre-eclampsia, before and after MgSO4, and in 17 normotensive patients. Pre-eclampsia was associated with a mean 11 mm Hg increase in pulse pressure (P less than 0.001), which fell by 8 mm Hg following MgSO4 infusion (P less than 0.001). With pre-eclampsia, pressure increases up to 45/28 mm Hg were observed during contractions. Theoretically, reduced pulse pressure, resulting in decreased shearing force applied to vessel walls, could be a previously unrecognized therapeutic effect of MgSO4. Potentially dangerous pressure elevations could be missed by relying exclusively on diastolic values measured between contractions.",preeclampsia
Preeclampsia is a multifactorial disease characterized by hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation of the pregnancy. Preeclampsia is characterized by the deposition of fibrin in the walls of small blood vessels. D-dimer was used as a marker for degradation/synthesis of fibrin in vivo. D-dimer has emerged as a useful indicator in the diagnosis of thrombotic conditions because its plasma concentration has a high predictive value for the assessment of venous thromboembolism. The purpose of this study was to evaluate plasma levels of D-dimer and preeclampsia compared to normal pregnancy occurs. We found that elevated levels of D-dimer is associated with the development of preeclampsia in the third trimester of pregnancy compared with normal pregnancy occurs. Preliminary findings highlight the need for further in-depth studies during pregnancy in order to fully clarify the diagnostic/prognostic role of D-dimer preeclampsia.,preeclampsia
"Early-onset preeclampsia (16-24 weeks) is frequently associated with fetal and placental anomalies. Hydatidiform mole, fetoplacental triploidy with partial molar changes and idiopathic hydrops fetalis are commonly associated ones. Two patients had severe, early-onset preeclampsia and ultrasonically documented fetal anomalies, one fetal triploidy, the other idiopathic hydrops with normal karyotype. The management of early-onset preeclampsia benefits from ultrasonography, and an aggressive search for fetal anomalies is recommended. Seventy-two percent of cases of early-onset preeclampsia in our institution were associated with significant fetal and placental malformations. An immunologic basis of the preeclampsia in these cases seems likely but remains unproven.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. A full understanding of the pathogenesis of this enigmatic condition is essential if we are to develop new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Central to our understanding of the pathogenesis of early-onset preeclampsia is absolute utero-placental ischaemia, which is lack of placental vascular transformation in early pregnancy. By contrast, relative utero-placental ischaemia, due to a mismatch between utero-placental blood flow and increased demand for nutrients occurring later in pregnancy, may be central to the development of late-onset pre-eclampsia. These pathogenic mechanisms have advanced our understanding of this condition, leading to better prediction, screening and intervention modalities. Screening for pre-eclampsia in the first and second trimesters by investigating the maternoplacental circulation and placental hormones could identify a high-risk subgroup. The advantage of screening in the first trimester is that a prophylactic intervention is available in the form of low-dose aspirin, if started before 16 weeks' gestation in the high-risk group, resulting in a substantial reduction in severe early-onset pre-eclampsia, while identification of a high-risk group in the second trimester will lead to focused management in this group. Using a combination of cardiac Doppler, multi-vessel Doppler assessment of the foetal circulation and biomarkers in established pre-eclampsia in the third trimester could predict adverse outcomes and guide clinicians to timeous delivery. Hopefully, advances in our understanding of this enigmatic disease will lead to further prophylactic and new therapeutic interventions.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To study associations between established risk factors for pre-eclampsia and different clinical manifestations of the disease. Design: A population-based, nested case-control study. Setting: Information from 12,804 consecutive deliveries that took place over three years at a birth clinic, which alone serves a population of nearly 240,000 in Rogaland county, Norway. Subjects: Cases of pre-eclampsia (n = 323) and healthy controls (n = 650) were selected. Pre-eclampsia was defined as increase in diastolic blood pressure (> or = 25 mmHg to > or = 90 mmHg) and proteinuria (> or = 1+ by dipstick testing) after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Main study measures: Parity, previous pre-eclampsia, blood pressure, maternal weight, and maternal smoking were included as study variables. Women with pre-eclampsia were grouped according to clinical manifestations of the disease (i.e. severity [mild, moderate or severe]) and time of onset (early or late gestation). Associations with the study factors were estimated as relative risks (odds ratio, OR). Results: Both nulliparity and hypertension increased pre-eclampsia risk, with no clear preference for any clinical subtype. High maternal weight was related to a higher risk of mild and moderate, but not severe, pre-eclampsia. Previous pre-eclampsia strongly increased the risk for pre-eclampsia in the current pregnancy, and the risk of early onset disease was especially high (OR 42.4; 95% CI 11.9-151.6). Overall, smoking was associated with a reduced risk for pre-eclampsia (OR 0.6; 95% CI 0.4-0.9). However, no effect of smoking was observed in the early onset disease group and among women with repeated pre-eclampsia. Conclusion: Nulliparity and hypertension increased the risk for each subgroup of pre-eclampsia, but high maternal weight, previous pre-eclampsia and smoking were not consistently associated with each clinical subtype. This observation may suggest that heterogeneous clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia may be preceded by different pathological mechanisms.",preeclampsia
"Recent investigations into the pathophysiology and immunobiology of preeclampsia have strongly implicated immunologic dysfunction as a central feature of this disease. A hypothesis is herein presented which unifies current research with clinical manifestations, in an attempt to clarify the etiology of this obstetric enigma.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia, a major cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality, may be difficult to distinguish clinically from other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Signs helpful in its diagnosis include presentation during late gestation in a nullipara with edema and proteinuria, and one or more of the following: hemoconcentration, hypoalbuminemia, liver function and/or coagulation abnormalities, and increased urate levels. Measures that may prove useful in differentiating preeclampsia from less dangerous forms of hypertension are decreased antithrombin III levels, increments in serum iron and carboxyhemoglobin, and decreases in urinary calcium. Major pathophysiological features of preeclampsia are decreased cardiac output, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and plasma volume; and marked increases in peripheral vascular resistance, as well as exaggerated pressor responses to endogenous angiotensin II and catecholamines. Renal hemodynamics decrease, in part as a result of a characteristic morphological lesion in glomeruli (""endotheliosis""), and there may be increased vascular permeability leading to albumin loss from the intravascular space. When gestation is advanced, termination is the treatment of choice; when temporization is required, several antihypertensive medications whose safety and efficacy have been tested in pregnant women are available. Magnesium sulfate remains the drug of choice for impending convulsions (the eclamptic phase of the disease). Finally, the etiology of preeclampsia remains unknown, but a popular theory suggests that alterations in prostaglandin metabolism may be responsible for the hypertension and coagulopathy in this disorder. In this respect, prophylactic treatment with low doses of aspirin, which decrease platelet thromboxane production but spare endothelial prostacyclin release, may decrease the incidence of preeclampsia in ""high-risk"" populations.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia (PE) is one of the main causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality in the world, causing nearly 40% of births delivered before 35 weeks of gestation. PE begins with inadequate trophoblast invasion early in pregnancy, which produces an increase in oxidative stress contributing to the development of systemic endothelial dysfunction in the later phases of the disease, leading to the characteristic clinical manifestation of PE. Numerous methods have been used to predict the onset of PE with different degrees of efficiency. These methods have used fetal/placental and maternal markers in different stages of pregnancy. From an epidemiological point of view, many studies have shown that PE is a disease with a strong familiar predisposition, which also varies according to geographical, socioeconomic, and racial features, and this information can be used in the prediction process. Large amounts of research have shown a genetic association with a multifactorial polygenic inheritance in the development of this disease. Many biological candidate genes and polymorphisms have been examined in their relation with PE. We will discuss the most important of them, grouped by the different pathogenic mechanisms involved in PE.",preeclampsia
"Background: Early (EOP) and late onset (LOP) preeclampsia are two subtypes of preeclampsia. This study examines the effect of maternal omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E supplementation in a rat model of preeclampsia.Method: Pregnant Wistar rats were assigned to control; EOP; LOP; EOP+omega-3 fatty acid supplementation+vitamin E and LOP+omega-3 fatty acid supplementation+vitamin E. L-Nitroarginine methylester was used to induce preeclampsia. Blood Pressure (BP) was recorded during pregnancy and dams were dissected at d14 and d20 of gestation.Results: Animals from EOP and LOP groups demonstrated higher systolic and diastolic BP, lower weight gain, lower conceptuses size, lower conceptuses weight and fetal weight as compared to control. EOP and LOP groups showed higher percentage of fetal resorptions and embryotoxicity (deformities and hematomas).Conclusion: Supplementation reduced the diastolic BP, percentage of resorptions and embryotoxicity only in the LOP group, suggesting a need for differential supplementation regime for the two subtypes of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To evaluate the relationship of anaerobic metabolism, as reflected by the calculated base deficit, with oxygen transport and left ventricular function in women with severe preeclampsia. Methods: Forty women with singleton pregnancies and severe preeclampsia who met prescribed criteria for invasive hemodynamic monitoring had arterial blood gas and hemodynamic values obtained immediately after placement of a pulmonary artery catheter. Oxygen transport indices were stratified according to the admission base deficit. Results: Linear regression analysis demonstrated a strong negative correlation between the calculated base deficit and the oxygen delivery index (r = -0.64), cardiac index (r = -0.62), and left ventricular stroke work index (r = -0.58). A baseline maternal base deficit exceeding -8.0 mEq/L consistently predicted fetal acidosis, fetal death, and maternal end-organ ischemic injury. Conclusion: The calculated base deficit reliably reflects maternal oxygen transport dynamics and identifies patients at risk for end-organ injury. Ventricular contractility and oxygen delivery decline with mounting oxygen debt.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To assess whether increased placental or systemic endothelin synthesis has a pathogenic role in pre-eclampsia (gestational proteinuric hypertension). Design: Prospective observations study. Subjects: 19 women with pre-eclampsia and 10 healthy pregnant women were studies. All were in the last trimester. Main outcome measures: Preproendothelin-1 gene expression by Northern blot analysis and generation of endothelin-1 precursor, big-endothelin-1, and endothelin isoforms, namely endothelin-1, 2 and 3, were assessed by specific radio-immunoassays, in placental tissue. Plasma endothelin-1 levels and urinary excretion of big-endothelin-1 and endothelin-1 were measured. Results: Placental preproendothelin-1 gene expression and immunoreactive big-endothelin-1 and endothelin-1, 2 and 3, were comparable in placental tissue from pre-eclamptic and normal pregnant women. Plasma levels of endothelin-1 did not differ between pre-eclamptic and normal pregnancies. In contrast, urinary excretion of endothelin-1, which is likely to reflect the renal synthesis of the peptide, was significantly decreased in pre-eclamptic, as compared with normal pregnant women. This was not due to a decreased renal generation of endothelin-1 precursor, since urinary excretion of big-endothelin-1 did not differ between pre-eclamptic and normal pregnancies. These data suggest an increased renal endothelin-1 breakdown in pre-eclampsia. Conclusions: Endothelin is unlikely to play a role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Instead, an increased renal breakdown may have a role in limiting the negative effects of other vasoactive factors on the renal circulation.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia encompasses multiple conditions of varying severity. We examined the recurrence and familial aggregation of preeclampsia by timing of onset, which is a marker for severity. We ascertained personal and family histories of preeclampsia for women who delivered live singletons in Denmark in 1978-2008 (almost 1.4 million pregnancies). Using log-linear binomial regression, we estimated risk ratios for the associations between personal and family histories of preeclampsia and the risk of early-onset (before 34 weeks of gestation, which is typically the most severe), intermediate-onset (at 34-36 weeks of gestation), and late-onset (after 36 weeks of gestation) preeclampsia. Previous early-, intermediate-, or late-onset preeclampsia increased the risk of recurrent preeclampsia with the same timing of onset 25.2 times (95% confidence interval (CI): 21.8, 29.1), 19.7 times (95% CI: 17.0, 22.8), and 10.3 times (95% CI: 9.85, 10.9), respectively, compared with having no such history. Preeclampsia in a woman's family was associated with a 24%-163% increase in preeclampsia risk, with the strongest associations for early- and intermediate-onset preeclampsia in female relatives. Preeclampsia in the man's family did not affect a woman's risk of early-onset preeclampsia and was only weakly associated with her risks of intermediate- and late-onset preeclampsia. Early-onset preeclampsia appears to have the largest genetic component, whereas environmental factors likely contribute most to late-onset preeclampsia. The role of paternal genes in the etiology of preeclampsia appears to be limited.",preeclampsia
"Background: Women with a history of pre-eclampsia have a higher risk of developing pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancies. However, the role of the inter-pregnancy interval on this association is unclear. Objective: To explore the effect of inter-pregnancy interval on the risk of recurrent pre-eclampsia or eclampia. Search strategy: MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS were searched (inception to July 2015). Selection criteria: Cohort studies assessing the risk of recurrent pre-eclampsia in the immediate subsequent pregnancy according to different birth intervals. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently performed screening, data extraction, methodological and quality assessment. Meta-analysis of adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) was used to measure the association between various interval lengths and recurrent pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Main results: We identified 1769 articles and finally included four studies with a total of 77,561 women. The meta-analysis of two studies showed that compared to inter-pregnancy intervals of 2-4 years, the aOR for recurrent pre-eclampsia was 1.01 [95 % CI 0.95 to 1.07, I(2) 0 %] with intervals of less than 2 years and 1.10 [95 % CI 1.02 to 1.19, I(2) 0 %] with intervals longer than 4 years. Conclusion: Compared to inter-pregnancy intervals of 2 to 4 years, shorter intervals are not associated with an increased risk of recurrent pre-eclampsia but longer intervals appear to increase the risk. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution as included studies are observational and thus subject to possible confounding factors.",preeclampsia
"There are conflicting reports on blood viscosity and its determinants in pre-eclampsia. We investigated the presence of hyperviscosity and its determinants in 25 nulliparous, pre-eclamptic Jamaican women. An equal number of non-pre-eclamptic, gestation-matched women served as controls. There was no statistically significant difference in whole blood, plasma and serum viscosities, as well as in their determinants, namely, haematocrit, fibrinogen, IgM and IgG concentrations between the pre-eclamptic and control groups. This suggests that hyperviscosity is not a feature of pre-eclampsia in this Jamaican population.",preeclampsia
"This study aims to investigate the risk factors and the joint biochemical indicators predictive value for preeclampsia. Related factors and biochemical indicators were investigated in 558 patients with preeclampsia and 435 normal pregnant women. Multiplicity analysis was performed by logistic regression. The predictive value of the biochemical index and joint biochemical indicators for predicting the incidence of pregnant women preeclampsia were analyzed by ROC curve. A progestation BMI of >24 kg/m2 (OR = 5.412, 95% CI: 1.169-9.447), hypertension history (OR = 7.487, 95% CI: 2.541-11.247) and advanced age (>35 years old, OR = 6.321, 95% CI: 3.142-20.342) are risk factors for preeclampsia. Tumor necrosis factor-α and plasma protein-A are valuable for preeclampsia prediction. The predictive success of preeclampsia could be improved by clinical risk factors associated with biochemical indicators detection.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal/neonatal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Therefore, widely applicable and affordable tests are needed to make an early diagnosis before the occurrence of the clinical symptoms. Circulating cell-free nucleic acids in plasma and serum are novel biomarkers with promising clinical applications in different medical fields, including prenatal diagnosis. Quantitative changes of cell-free fetal (cff)DNA in maternal plasma as an indicator for impending preeclampsia have been reported in different studies, using real-time quantitative PCR for the male-specific SRY or DYS 14 loci. In case of early onset preeclampsia, elevated levels may be already seen in the first trimester. The increased levels of cffDNA before the onset of symptoms may be due to hypoxia/reoxygenation within the intervillous space leading to tissue oxidative stress and increased placental apoptosis and necrosis. In addition to the evidence for increased shedding of cffDNA into the maternal circulation, there is also evidence for reduced renal clearance of cffDNA in preeclampsia. As the amount of fetal DNA is currently determined by quantifying Y-chromosome specific sequences, alternative approaches such as the measurement of total cell-free DNA or the use of gender-independent fetal epigenetic markers, such as DNA methylation, offer a promising alternative. Cell-free RNA of placental origin might be another potentially useful biomarker for screening and diagnosis of preeclampsia in clinical practice. Fetal RNA is associated with subcellular placental particles that protect it from degradation. Its levels are ten-fold higher in pregnant women with preeclampsia compared to controls. In conclusion, through the use of gender-independent sequences, the universal incorporation of fetal nucleic acids into routine obstetric care and into screening or diagnostic settings using combined markers may soon become a reality. Effort has now to be put into the establishment of standardized and simplified protocols for the analysis of these biomarkers in a clinical setting.",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy disorder, characterised by hypertension and multisystem complications in the mother. The adverse outcomes of pre-eclampsia include severe hypertension, stroke, renal and hepatic injury, haemorrhage, fetal growth restriction and even death. The optimal time to instigate delivery to prevent morbidity when pre-eclampsia occurs between 34 and 37 weeks' gestation, without increasing problems related to infant immaturity or complications, remains unclear. Methods/design: The PHOENIX trial is a non-masked, randomised controlled trial, comparing planned early delivery (with initiation of delivery within 48 h of randomisation) with usual care (expectant management) in women with pre-eclampsia between 34+ 0 and 36+ 6 weeks' gestation. The primary objectives of the trial are to determine if planned delivery reduces adverse maternal outcomes, without increasing the short-term harm to infants (composite of perinatal deaths or neonatal unit admissions up to infant hospital discharge) or impacting long-term infant neurodevelopmental status at 2 years corrected age (Parent Report of Cognitive Abilities-Revised). Discussion: Current practice in the UK at the time of trial commencement for management of pre-eclampsia varies by gestation. Previous trials have shown that in women with pre-eclampsia after 37 weeks of gestion, delivery is initiated, as maternal complications are reduced without increasing fetal risks. Prior to 34 weeks of gestation, usual management aims to prolong pregnancy for fetal benefit, unless severe complications occur, necessitating preterm delivery. This trial aims to address the uncertainty for women where the balance of benefits and risks of delivery compared to expectant management are uncertain. Previous trials in this area have been undertaken, but have not provided a definitive answer, and the research question remains active. The results of this trial are expected to influence clinical practice internationally, through direct adoption and by incorporation into guidelines in countries with similar settings.

"Objective: To determine whether there is a relationship between plasma glucose level in a glucose screening test and the occurrence of pre-eclampsia in non-diabetic pregnant women. Methods: All pregnant non-diabetic women attending the antenatal clinic at the Aga Khan University Medical Center were screened with a 75 g-2 h glucose challenge test (GCT). From 1988-90, a data base of 1316 cases was compiled for use in this study. Of these, 67 had to be excluded because of one or more abnormal levels in the 75 g-3 h oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) that required treatment to maintain euglycemia. Among the remaining patients (n = 1249) who had no evidence of glucose intolerance and were included in the analysis, there were 42 cases of pre-eclampsia. The association between pre-eclampsia and plasma glucose level in the GCT was evaluated using logistic regression analysis that adjusted for effects of age and gravidity. Results: The odds of having pre-eclampsia were increased by 20% (95% confidence interval 0%-44%) per mmol/l rise in plasma glucose level in the GCT. The same statistic for age was 9% (95% confidence interval 2%-17%), and for primigravidity it was 210% (95% confidence interval 55%-517%). There was no significant interaction between these variables. Conclusions: Minor degrees of glucose intolerance, age and primigravidity are associated with a higher occurrence of pre-eclampsia in non-diabetic pregnant women.",preeclampsia
"Radionuclidic method is used in women with preeclampsia to evaluate the state of the central hemodynamics. The examined women are divided into 6 groups. The results are presented on 2 tables with 23 investigated parameters as intergroup correlation is made. The obtained results show the presence of hypoglycemia, increased peripheral resistance, etc., which are in direct dependence on the degree, gravity and duration of the disease. It is possible to discover occurring changes quite early by this method and thus to begin timely proper therapy, which reduces perinatal morbidity and mortality. It is very important that data are obtained by this method, which could not be determined by other methods. However its usage should be performed electively by very strict indications after the possibilities of other methods are tried (ultrasound, rheography, ect.).",preeclampsia
"Placental dysfunction and oxidative stress contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, which is a pregnancy-specific disorder. It has been suggested that the incidence of preeclampsia has a seasonal variation. Melatonin, as a seasonal factor, has been suggested to be involved in a successful pregnancy. In this study, we investigated the association of circulating levels of melatonin with preeclampsia. Serum was collected from women with preeclampsia (n=113) and gestation-matched healthy pregnant women, and the levels of melatonin were measured. In addition, the expression of melatonin receptors was examined in preeclamptic placentae (n=27). The association of the incidence of preeclampsia and seasonal variation was also analysed from 1491 women with preeclampsia within 77 745 healthy pregnancies. The serum levels of melatonin were significantly reduced in women with preeclampsia at presentation and these reduced serum levels of melatonin were not associated with the severity or time onset of preeclampsia nor with seasonal variation. The expression of melatonin receptor, MT1 was reduced in preeclamptic placentae. The incidence of preeclampsia was did exhibit seasonal variation, but this was largely due to the increase in the incidence of mild or late-onset preeclampsia. Our results demonstrate that reduced melatonin levels are associated with the development of preeclampsia but that the circulating levels of melatonin do not appear to be subject to seasonal variation during pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"Among pregnancy pathologies preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction are among the leading causes of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. For both syndromes, the etiologies are still unclear in many facets. For the development of preeclampsia the presence of the placenta is a prerequisite, while for FGR a variety of other factors may be decisive. Cases with a combination of FGR and preeclampsia are the most severe cases and need clinical intervention. Studies on such cases have misled scientists and clinicians to hypothesize that a failure of trophoblast invasion is a specific feature of the early onset type of preeclampsia. Recent development in preeclampsia specific biomarkers and the intense use of Doppler ultrasound measurements already in the first trimester of pregnancy has resulted in a new understanding of the pathways leading to preeclampsia or FGR.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a major obstetrical complication affecting maternal and fetal health. While it is clear that there is a substantial placental contribution to preeclampsia pathogenesis, the maternal contribution is less well characterized. We therefore performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to explore disease-associated changes in maternal gene expression patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Methods: Preeclampsia was defined as gestational hypertension, proteinuria and hyperurecimia. Total RNA was isolated from PBMCs obtained from women with uncomplicated pregnancies (n = 5) and women with preeclamptic pregnancies (n = 5). Gene expression analysis was carried out using Agilent oligonucleotide microarrays. Biological pathway analysis was undertaken using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Quantitative real-time PCR (QRTPCR) was performed to validate the gene expression changes of selected genes in normotensive and preeclamptic patients (n = 12 each). Results: We identified a total of 368 genes that were differentially expressed in women with preeclampsia compared to normal controls with false discovery rate (FDR) controlled at 10%. In follow up experiments we further analyzed the expression levels of a number of genes that were identified as altered by the microarray data including survivin (BIRC5), caveolin (CAV1), GATA binding protein-1 (GATA1), signal tranducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), E2F transcription factor-1 (E2F1), fibronectin-1 (FN1), interleukin-4 (IL-4), matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) and WAP four disulfide domain protein (WFDC-1) by QRTPCR. Additionally we performed immuno blot analysis and zymography to verify some of these candidate genes at the protein level. Computational analysis of gene function identified an anti-proliferative and altered immune function cellular phenotype in severe preeclamptic samples. Conclusions: We have characterized the genome-wide mRNA expression changes associated with preeclampsia-specific genes in circulating maternal blood cells at the time of delivery. In addition to providing information relating to the biological basis of the preeclampsia phenotype, our data provide a number of potential biomarkers for use in the further characterization of this disease.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia is a multifactorial disease with unknown pathogenesis. Even when recent studies explored this disease using several bioinformatics tools, the main objective was not directed to pathogenesis. Additionally, consensus prioritization was proved to be highly efficient in the recognition of genes-disease association. However, not information is available about the consensus ability to early recognize genes directly involved in pathogenesis. Therefore our aim in this study is to apply several theoretical approaches to explore preeclampsia; specifically those genes directly involved in the pathogenesis. Methods: We firstly evaluated the consensus between 12 prioritization strategies to early recognize pathogenic genes related to preeclampsia. A communality analysis in the protein-protein interaction network of previously selected genes was done including further enrichment analysis. The enrichment analysis includes metabolic pathways as well as gene ontology. Microarray data was also collected and used in order to confirm our results or as a strategy to weight the previously enriched pathways. Results: The consensus prioritized gene list was rationally filtered to 476 genes using several criteria. The communality analysis showed an enrichment of communities connected with VEGF-signaling pathway. This pathway is also enriched considering the microarray data. Our result point to VEGF, FLT1 and KDR as relevant pathogenic genes, as well as those connected with NO metabolism. Conclusion: Our results revealed that consensus strategy improve the detection and initial enrichment of pathogenic genes, at least in preeclampsia condition. Moreover the combination of the first percent of the prioritized genes with protein-protein interaction network followed by communality analysis reduces the gene space. This approach actually identifies well known genes related with pathogenesis. However, genes like HSP90, PAK2, CD247 and others included in the first 1% of the prioritized list need to be further explored in preeclampsia pathogenesis through experimental approaches.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder, of unknown aetiology, usually associated with raised blood pressure and proteinuria. Although outcome for most women and their babies is good, it remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. A wide range of interventions for prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia have been evaluated in randomized trials. This evidence provides the basis for a rational approach to care. Overall, there is insufficient evidence for any firm conclusion about the effects of any aspect of diet or lifestyle during pregnancy. Antiplatelet agents are associated with a 19% reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia (relative risk 0.81; 95% CI 0.75, 0.88), a 7% reduction in the risk of preterm birth (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.89, 0.98), a 16% reduction in the risk of stillbirth or neonatal death (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.74, 0.96) and an 8% reduction in the risk of a small for gestational age baby (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.85, 1.00). For mild to moderate hypertension, trials evaluating bed rest are too small for reliable conclusions about the potential benefits and hazards. Antihypertensive agents halve the risk of progression to severe hypertension (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.41, 0.64), but with no clear effect on pre-eclampsia (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.84, 1.18), or any other substantive outcome. For severe hypertension, there is no good evidence that one drug is any better than another. Plasma volume expansion for severe pre-eclampsia seems unlikely to be beneficial, although the trials are small. The optimum timing of delivery for pre-eclampsia before 34 weeks is unclear. Magnesium sulphate more than halves the risk of eclampsia (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.29, 0.58) and probably reduces the risk of maternal death (RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.26, 1.10). It is also the drug of choice for treatment of eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To investigate the ability of immediate postpartum curettage to accelerate maternal recovery from severe preeclampsia. Methods: Thirty-two parturients with severe preeclampsia were randomly assigned to either undergo ultrasound-directed curettage following delivery or to have no curettage. Results: Subjects who underwent immediate postpartum curettage had a significantly decreased mean arterial pressure at each 2-hour point for the first 24 hours compared with those who were not curetted (P < .0002). The mean urine output after uterine curettage was significantly greater during each 4-hour interval of the first 24 hours postpartum compared with controls (P < .0002). The platelet count increased in the curettage group from 12 to 24 hours following curettage, whereas controls exhibited a decrease in the platelet count from 12 to 24 hours (P < .0003). Conclusion: Immediate puerperal uterine curettage of the parturient with severe preeclampsia appears to accelerate disease recovery with no apparent adverse sequelae.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To investigate whether polymorphisms of angiotensin converting enzyme gene (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor type 1 gene (AT1R) are associated with etiology of preeclampsia and renal impact in women with preeclampsia. Methods: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 133 patients with preeclampsia and 105 healthy pregnant women. The I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene was assessed by polymerase chain reaction, and the A1166C polymorphism of the AT(1)R gene was additionally assessed by DdeI digestion. The level of proteinuria, fasting serum urea, creatinine and uric acid were investigated according to different genotypes of ACE and AT1R genes. Results: The frequency of genotypes of the ACE gene and the AT1R gene was similar in preeclampsia and normal pregnancy. DD and ID genotype predominated in patients with severe proteinuria, as well as increased serum urea and uric acid. Serum creatinine was also increased, but no significant difference was found among three genotypes. The level of proteinuria, serum uric acid, urea, and creatinine did not vary between different AT1R genotypes. Compared with patients without renal dysfunction, the frequency of DD and ID genotypes of ACE gene was much higher in those with renal dysfunction, but AC and CC genotypes of AT1R gene were not. Conclusion: We found no association of the two gene polymorphisms with preeclampsia. However, ACE gene I/D polymorphisms were associated with the severe proteinuria and renal dysfunction seen in preeclampsia. Preeclampsia patients carrying the D allele may be susceptible to renal dysfunction.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To determine international expert practice of fluid management and monitoring in severe preeclampsia. Methods: The 447 members of the ISSHP (International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy) were issued a postal questionnaire to determine their views and practices of fluid management in severe preeclampsia. Results: One hundred sixty-six (37%) completed questionnaires were received. Responses indicated that there is no consensus regarding most aspects of management of severe preeclamptic patients. In particular, there is no agreement about which fluid type to administer and how to assess circulatory status in these patients. There were also wide variations in the use of plasma volume expansion as a treatment modality. Statistical comparison of the use of Swan-Ganz catheters in ""theoretical"" and ""actual"" practice showed highly significant differences (p < 0.001). The majority of respondents were interested in participating in future research. Conclusion: The results reflect genuine uncertainty generated by a lack of evidence from randomized trials addressing the acute management of severe preeclamptic patients. Even where clinicians are confident ""in theory"" that a particular form of treatment is the best, they do not appear to have the resources or commitment to match this with ""practice."" The majority of respondents were very keen to develop the questions raised further in the context of multicenter clinical trials.",preeclampsia
"In this review, a novel and unifying pathophysiologic mechanism of preeclampsia is presented whereby a minimal excess of placental immune complex production versus removal causes a proinflammatory autoamplification cascade of trophoblast apoptosis/necrosis and oxidative stress, culminating in clinical preeclampsia. This concept immediately leads to a plethora of new and robust therapeutic strategies.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy specific disorder characterised by hypertension and proteinuria occurring after the twentieth week of gestation. Preeclampsia induced hypertension is the result of increased vascular reactivity and endothelial dysfunction, however, the mechanisms underlying this state remain elusive. One possible mediator may be the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of proteinases typically recognized for long term tissue remodelling. This review examines the evidence suggesting a role for MMPs in acutely regulating vascular function. Studies have shown that MMPs can activate vasoconstrictors (e.g. endothelin), inactivate vasodilators (e.g. calcitonin gene related peptide) and transactivate cell surface receptors responsible for vasoconstriction (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor). The potential role of these proteinases in preeclampsia will then be discussed.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To describe our experience with preeclampsia in high-order multifetal gestations. Methods: Records for all triplet and quadruplet pregnancies delivered after 24 weeks' gestation from January 1988 through June 1994 were reviewed. All patients were treated with bed rest from 20 weeks' gestation onward and received corticosteroids weekly beginning at 24 weeks. Tocolytics were used as needed. Results: Twenty-one triplet and eight quadruplet pregnancies were studied. The mean gestational age at delivery was 32.3 and 27.9 weeks, and mean birth weights were 1547 and 1028 g, respectively. Seventeen of 29 patients developed preeclampsia, 14 of the 21 triplet mothers and three of the eight quadruplet mothers. Among 16 patients who were delivered for preeclampsia, only eight had blood pressure (BP) elevation before delivery, whereas ten had epigastric pain, visual disturbances and/or headache; nine had elevated liver enzyme levels; and seven had low platelet counts. Only three patients had proteinuria, and only six had edema. Five women developed the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets postpartum, all of whom had normal BP before delivery. Two patients developed preeclampsia after delivery. A total of 95 infants were delivered, all by cesarean, of whom 93 (98%) survived. Conclusion: Preeclampsia is common in high-order multifetal gestations and often presents in an atypical manner. Hypertension is not always the presenting sign, and symptoms consistent with severe preeclampsia and abnormal laboratory values predominate.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To investigate the relationship between uterine artery Doppler ultrasound indices and birth weight in women with early-, intermediate- and late-onset pre-eclampsia as compared with women with uneventful pregnancy outcome. Methods: In a retrospective, observational cohort study, uterine artery Doppler assessment was carried out at 18+0 to 23+6 weeks' gestation in 26,893 women attending for routine antenatal care in a tertiary care center. The mean resistance index (RI) and its relationship to the outcome of pregnancy and birth-weight centiles were evaluated. Results: Uterine artery RI showed a significant, negative correlation with birth weight (r= -0.20, P<0.0001). Patients with early-onset pre-eclampsia had an increased prevalence of high uterine artery mean RI, above the 90(th) centile, corresponding to an increased proportion of small-for-gestational age (SGA) neonates with a birth weight below the 10(th) centile. In late-onset pre-eclampsia, however, there was an unexpectedly higher proportion of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) neonates with a birth weight above the 90(th) centile without a concurrent increase in the prevalence of low uterine artery mean RI below the 10(th) centile. Conclusions: The finding of a bimodal skewed distribution of birth weight, with neonates exhibiting a higher prevalence of both LGA and SGA with late-onset pre-eclampsia, indicates that there are two types of late-onset pre-eclampsia. These findings explain the poor performance of mid-trimester uterine artery Doppler in predicting pre-eclampsia at term and provide insights into the placental origins of the early and late forms of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Aim: The potential role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia has been reported in the literature. There are only a few studies that have investigated changes in malondialdehyde (MDA), vitamin E and total blood glutathione together in pre-eclampsia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to measure the levels of MDA, vitamin E and total glutathione as putative circulatory markers of oxidative stress for the early detection of pre-eclampsia. Patients & methods: In this case-control study, blood samples were collected from 40 pre-eclamptic and 80 normal pregnant females at the department of obstetrics and gynecology at King Abdulaziz Medical City (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) between February 2009 and January 2010. Circulating markers of oxidative stress were evaluated, including MDA, total glutathione and vitamin E, by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: Markers of oxidative stress including serum MDA, total glutathione and vitamin E were found to be significantly different in both groups. Conclusion: MDA, vitamin E and blood total glutathione are possible candidate markers to predict pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To compare histopathological differences in placentas from early- and late-onset preeclampsia, as well as late-onset preeclampsia and normal term deliveries. Methods: This prospective study was performed at Tygerberg Hospital, a secondary and tertiary referral center in South Africa. Placentas from 100 women, 25 each with early and late-onset preeclampsia, and an equal number of controls matched for gestational age, underwent routine preparation and were evaluated independently by two pathologists in a strictly predetermined, standardized manner. Results: Compared to late preeclampsia, placentas in the early preeclampsia group were smaller (p < 0.01), had more infarction (odds ratio [OR] = 4.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-13.5) and inappropriate maturation (OR = 16.62, 95% CI = 4.1-68.0). Placentas from the late-onset preeclampsia group showed increased decidual arteriopathy (OR = 5.09, 95% CI = 1.45-17.92) and abruptio placentae (OR = 5.41, 95% CI = 1.01-28.79) compared to controls. Conclusions: The early- and late-onset preeclampsia placentas showed clear histopathological differences, whereas late-onset preeclampsia and normal term placentas differed less. These findings support the contention that early- and late-onset preeclampsia are different subclasses of disease.",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disorder that presents major health problems for both mothers and babies. It is a major cause of maternal mortality, especially in developing countries, where it may account for 80% of maternal deaths. In this review we have discussed the putative pathogenetic mechanisms of this severe illness. Methods: Review of the international literature on pre-eclampsia. Results: Pre-eclampsia occurs predominantly in primigravidas and is associated with increased foetal and maternal risk. Generally speaking, one could hypothesise that during pre-eclampsia the oxidative, coagulative and vasomotor balance is altered by increased sensitivity to angiotensin II associated with reduced synthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins, sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, hyperlipidaemia associated with raised lipoperoxide synthesis and incomplete implant of cytotrophoblast in maternal spiral arteries. General vasoconstriction could then be a consequence with related utero-placental ischaemia and endothelial damage. These features are clinically characterised by arterial hypertension, proteinuria and sodium retention. The predisposition to develop pre-eclampsia seems to be at least partially hereditary and the risk seems to be transmissible through male sons. To explain the susceptibility of some women to develop pre-eclampsia, specific genetic polymorphisms have been associated to increased risk. Conclusions: Many factors are involved in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Occasionally these factors seem to act together, sometimes they do not and, consequently, it might be difficult to postulate a common pathogenesis for the disorder. Good obstetrical practice will identify known risk factors but will not enable physicians to determine the risk value for a particular pregnancy. Moreover, we are far from understanding the exact mechanisms involved, let alone acting upon them. The achievement of these objectives constitute a remarkable challenge for research.",preeclampsia
"Background: Although the exact pathophysiology of preeclampsia is not completely understood, the utility of different platelets indices can be utilized to predict preeclampsia. Objective: To compare platelet indices, namely platelet count (PC), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), and PC to MPV ratio in women with preeclampsia compared with healthy controls. Setting: Qassim Hospital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Design: A case-control study. Sixty preeclamptic women were the cases and an equal number of healthy pregnant women were the controls. Results: There was no significant difference in age, parity, and body mass index between the study groups. Sixteen and 44 of the cases were severe and mild preeclampsia, respectively. There was no significant difference in PDW and MPV between the preeclamptic and control women. Both PC and PC to MPV ratios were significantly lower in the women with preeclampsia compared with the controls. There was no significant difference in the PC, PDW, MPV, and PC to MPV ratio when women with mild and severe preeclampsia were compared. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the PC cutoff was 248.0×103/µL for diagnosis of pre-eclampsia (P=0.019; the area under the ROC curve was 62.4%). Binary regression suggests that women with PC <248.010×103/µL were at higher risk of preeclampsia (odds ratio =2.2, 95% confidence interval =1.08-4.6, P=0.03). The PC/MPV cutoff was 31.2 for diagnosis of preeclampsia (P=0.035, the area under the ROC curve was 62.2%). Conclusion: PC <248.010×103/µL and PC to MPV ratio 31.2 are valid predictors of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia causes substantial morbidity and mortality. A significant part of the etiology of preeclampsia involves endothelial damage and platelet activation and in this way can be conceived as an illness with a pathophysiology similar to coronary artery disease. Depression is an independent risk factor for the progression of cardiovascular disease [Am Heart J 140 (2000) S57] and there is evidence to suggest that it may be a risk factor for preeclampsia as well. SSRIs have been shown to reduce the progression of coronary artery disease, independent of improvement in mood. SSRIs may also reduce risk factors for preeclampsia in addition to treating depression in pregnancy. This is an important area for further research.",preeclampsia
"A 1200 calorie diet or cyclopenthiazide with potassium was given to two groups of 51 high weight gain primigravidae and baby weight and the incidence of pre-eclampsia were compared with those in a matched control group. There was no difference in the development of pre-eclampsia, but the weight of babies in the control group was higher than in the treated groups. The body fat was reduced in the diet group and the total body water in the diuretic group.",preeclampsia
"Physiologic alterations of the cardiovascular system during normal pregnancy are the basis of all discussions about the problem of preeclampsia and treatment. The main point has to be the sufficient blood supply to the fetus. In this review cardiovascular alterations in high and low pressure system have been reported. High arterial blood pressure, elevated total peripheral resistance, reduced plasma volume, hemoconcentration, reduced suspension stability and hyperviscosity are symptoms which can be treated. Clinical experiences with a hemodynamic adjusted treatment, giving firstly infusionary therapy for correcting hypovolemia with the aim of an improvement within the low pressure system which cause an increase of cardiac output and then secondly the use of only such antihypertensive drugs having favourable effects on the uteroplacental blood flow are good and confirm theoretical considerations.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia in its severe form is characterized by a high incidence of both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Its prevention is therefore one of the fundamental goals of modern obstetrics. Methods: Twenty-two women with severe preeclampsia have been perspectively examined and compared with 66 women without preeclampsia with the aim to evaluate the effect of the prenatal care and the influence of sociocultural variables. Results: Differences between the two groups weren't observed with regard to sociocultural features, but the women with severe preeclampsia were treated later and less controlled during pregnancy. Conclusions: Preeclampsia requires a careful surveillance and an intense care, above all in its severe form, to avoid the high tribute of maternal and fetal complications that this syndrome still causes today.",preeclampsia
Objective: Mirror syndrome (Ballantyne's syndrome) refers to the association of fetal hydrops and maternal preeclampsia. The aim of this study was to determine the relation and incidence between fetal hydrops and preeclampsia in our clinic. Methods: A retrospective review of patients associated with fetal hydrops and findings with preeclampsia was used. Seventy-five cases with single pregnancy and diagnoses with nonimmune hydrops fetalis were found. According to the data 4 cases were found related with preeclampsia. Results: Mirror syndrome is rarely encountered and underdiagnosed. We found a frequency of 5.3% (4 cases in 75 affected pregnancies) for single non-immune hydrops cases in which maternal hypertension occurred. Fetal outcome is depending on etiology and prognosis is mainly very low. Maternal symptoms and laboratory findings are resolving after intrauterine fetal death or delivery. Conclusion: Hydrops fetalis must be considered as a potential risk factor for preeclampsia. It is important that this clinical condition has a potential of about 5% for proceeding preeclampsia.,preeclampsia
"Objective: Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a serious complication that affects approximately 2% of pregnant women worldwide. At present, there is no sufficiently reliable test for early detection of PE in a screening setting that would allow timely intervention. To help future experimental identification of serum biomarkers for early onset PE, we applied a data mining approach to create a set of candidate biomarkers. Methods: We started from the disease etiology, which involves impaired trophoblast invasion into the spiral arteries. On the basis of this, we used a three-stage filtering strategy consisting of selection of tissue-specific genes, textmining for further gene prioritization, and identifying blood-detectable markers. Results: This approach resulted in 38 candidate biomarkers. These include the best three first-trimester serum biomarkers for PE found to date LGALS13 (placental protein 13, PP13), PAPPA (pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, PAPP-A), and PGF (placental growth factor, PlGF), as well as five proteins previously identified as biomarker after the first-trimester or disease onset. This substantiates the effectiveness of our approach and provides an important indication that the list will contain several new biomarkers for PE. Conclusions: We anticipate this list can serve in prioritization of future experimental studies on serum biomarkers for early onset PE.",preeclampsia
"Background: Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disease characterized by onset of hypertension and proteinuria, sometimes progressing into damaging other organs. Here, we investigated the pathological significance of the soluble fragment of LR11 (sLR11), a cell differentiation regulator, in comparison to circulating IL-6 and TNF-α, in pre-eclampsia. Methods: The study was conducted in a cross-sectional research design with fourteen pre-eclampsia patients and fifty healthy pregnant subjects. Pre-eclampsia was defined as hypertensive disorders in pregnancy at over 20 weeks of gestation with proteinuria. Results: Plasma levels of sLR11 as well as IL-6 in pre-eclampsia were increased compared with those in the healthy pregnant subjects at the first, the second, and the third trimester. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for the detection of pre-eclampsia among third-trimester subjects showed that the areas under the curves of sLR11 and IL-6 were equivalent. sLR11 and IL-6 correlated positively with TNF-α in healthy pregnant subjects. In the pre-eclampsia patients, there was neither a correlation between sLR11 and IL-6 nor between sLR11 and TNF-α. Conclusions: sLR11 increases during pregnancy, with levels further exaggerated in pre-eclampsia, and may be related to the pathology of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Because the trace element selenium behaves as an antioxidant and peroxynitrite scavenger when incorporated into selenoproteins, our objective was to determine whether low selenium status was associated with a greater risk of occurrence of preeclampsia. Study design: Fifty-three preeclamptic patients and 53 matched pregnant controls at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, gave clippings of their toenails (laid down from 3-12 months previously) for selenium determination by neutron activation analysis. Clinical characteristics of the women and their infants were recorded. Statistical analysis was by Wilcoxon signed rank test and odds ratios were calculated by the ratio of discordant pairs. Results: Median toenail selenium concentrations in the preeclamptic subjects were significantly lower than in their matched controls (P=.001). Being in the bottom tertile of toenail selenium was associated with a 4.4-fold (95% CI 1.6-14.9) greater incidence of the condition. Within the preeclamptic group, lower selenium status was significantly associated (P=.029) with more severe expression of disease, as measured by delivery before 32 weeks. Conclusion: In the light of the reduction in selenium status in a number of European countries in recent years, this study raises the question of whether a small increase in selenium intake might help prevent preeclampsia in susceptible women.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder affecting 2% to 8% of pregnancies and a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent investigations have improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of this potentially life-threatening disease, especially in its early-onset form of manifestation. Despite these advances, therapeutic options are still limited and no effective pharmacologic interventions are currently available. Ongoing lines of research indicate some potential novel treatments targeting specific pathogenic steps.

"Objective: Evaluating the validity of pre-eclampsia registration in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN) according to both broader and restricted disease definitions. Design: Retrospective nested cohort study. Setting: Multicenter study. Population: In this study, two cohorts of women with pre-eclamptic pregnancies registered in the MBRN were selected. Study group 1 contained 966 pregnancies from 1967 to 2002. Concomitant participation in the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study 2 was required. Study group 2 comprised 1138 pregnancies recorded in 1967-2005, examined as a pre-eclampsia biobank was established. Methods: Diagnostic criteria vary. The broader criteria for pre-eclampsia, used by the MBRN, are one measurement of hypertension and proteinuria (Criterion A). Criteria used internationally today require two measurements of hypertension and proteinuria (Criterion B). The diagnostic validities in Study groups 1 and 2 were judged against medical records according to Criterion A and B, respectively. Main outcome measures: Positive predictive value (PPV) and trend analyses. Results: The diagnosis was confirmed in 88.3% of pregnancies in Study group 1, and in 63.6% in Study group 2. PPV was high for Study group 1 throughout the period. For Study group 2, results improved significantly after 1986. Conclusions: This study ascertains high PPV of pre-eclampsia in the MBRN using broader traditional criteria, although the PPV decreases through assessment using restricted modern criteria. This illustrates how inclusion of direct measurements may improve registration of complex disorders defined by changing diagnostic criteria.",preeclampsia
"Aim: To develop a combined predictive model for preterm and term pre-eclampsia (PE) during the first trimester of pregnancy. Methods: This investigation was a nested case-control study in singleton pregnancies at the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Unit, University of Chile Hospital. A priori risks for preterm and term PE were calculated by multivariate logistic regression analyses. Biophysical markers were log10 -transformed and expressed as multiples of the median. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate a combined predictive model of preterm and term PE. Detection rates at different cut-off points were determined by a receiver operator curve analysis of a posteriori risks. Results: First trimester mean arterial pressure and uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index were significantly higher in women who develop PE than in the unaffected group. The detection rate of preterm PE based on maternal characteristics and biophysical markers was 72% at a 10% false-positive rate, corresponding to a cut-off risk of 1 in 50. The detection rate for term PE was 30% at a 10% false-positive rate. Conclusion: Preterm PE can be predicted by a combination of maternal characteristics and biophysical markers. However, first trimester screening is less valuable for term PE.",preeclampsia

"Aim: To establish alterations in maternal cardiac haemodynamics and function using electrocardiography and echocardiography in severe pre-eclampsia complicated by acute pulmonary oedema. Methods: An extensive literature search including any research articles, randomised control trials, observational study, case report or expert or consensus statement pertaining to severe pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, hypertensive crises of pregnancy, pulmonary oedema, maternal cardiac haemodynamics, Holter monitoring and maternal echocardiography was done. Electronic search strategies included searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Pubmed databases. Results: Toxic substrates from a chronically ischaemic placenta and elevated maternal cathecolamines leads to widespread elevated systemic vascular resistance, endothelial cell damage and increased left ventricular afterload all of which combine to result in left ventricular hypertrophy with impaired ventricular filling reflected as significant diastolic dysfunction, increased left ventricular end systolic and end diastolic volumes, increased left ventricular stroke work, myocardial ischaemia and resultant ventricular arrhythmias, in particular ventricular tachycardia. These factors could lead to cardiac failure in severe pre-eclampsia, either in combination or in independently of each other depending on the magnitude of the angiogenic imbalances, degree of elevated systemic vascular resistance, degree of impaired myocardial relaxation and diastolic filling anomalies, gene-environment interaction and degree of possible pre-existing or potential cardiovascular dysfunction. Conclusion: Comprehensive maternal echocardiographic and electocardiographic assessment should be incorporated in the work-up of severe pre-eclampsia to stratify these cases, to enable clinicians to choose the appropriate acute hypertensive drug therapy and plan optimal management pathways.",preeclampsia
"Immunology has been hypothesised to play a critical role in the development of pre-eclampsia. A number of epidemiological studies have shown that multiparous women who changed partner had an increased risk of pre-eclampsia in the following pregnancy compared with multiparous women with the same partner. However, partner change is often associated with a long birth interval. Two recent papers using data from the same birth registry reported that, after controlling for birth interval, partner change was associated with a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia. Based on a causal diagram, the author argues conceptually that birth interval is not a confounder but more likely to be a collider. Controlling for or stratifying birth interval in the association between partner change and risk of pre-eclampsia could be inappropriate and may have produced a spurious association.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To define the maternal demographic factors that predicts the risk of developing early-onset pre-eclampsia (requiring delivery before 34 weeks' gestation) in an Australian population. These are compared to risk factors described in a British population to determine whether the Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) risk algorithm for predicting early-onset pre-eclampsia needs to be modified for an Australian population. Methods: A secondary analysis of prospective cohorts in Australia and in the United Kingdom was conducted. Demographic details and past medical history were obtained. Odds ratios (ORs) for the development of early-onset pre-eclampsia were calculated for maternal factors in both populations. Forest plots were used to compare the two sets of odds ratios. Results: In the Australian population, pre-existing hypertension (OR 19.89, 95% CI 4.17-94.93) and body mass index >40 kg/m(2) (OR 9.04, 95% CI 1.13-72.40) predicted risk of developing early-onset pre-eclampsia. There were no significant differences in the odds ratios for maternal factors in the two populations. Conclusions: This study shows that the ORs used to describe risks associated with maternal characteristics in the FMF algorithm for early-onset pre-eclampsia are consistent with those found in our local population. There does not appear to be any value in changing the weighting of demographic factors included in the FMF algorithm for an Australian population.",preeclampsia
"Our purpose was to compare baseline hemodynamic parameters of mild and severe preeclampsia. Patients admitted to the Medical University Labor and Delivery Unit with the diagnosis of preeclampsia who had not received prior antihypertensive or magnesium sulfate therapy were recruited for noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring with thoracic electrical bioimpedance. After stabilization in the lateral recumbent position, hemodynamic monitoring was begun. Baseline hemodynamic parameters, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), cardiac index (CI), and stroke index (SI) were recorded. Stroke systemic vascular resistance index (SSVRI), the resistance imposed by vasculature on each beat of the heart, was calculated for each patient by multiplying SVRI by HR. For statistical analysis, unpaired Student's t-tests (two-tailed) were utilized (P < 0.01). Forty-one preeclamptic patients (20 mild, 21 severe) were enrolled. Mean gestational age of severe patients was 32.2 +/- 4.0 and of mild patients was 37.0 +/- 3.5. MAP, SBP, diastolic blood pressure, HR, and SSVRI were higher in the severe group. SVRI, CI, cardiac output, and SI did not differ significantly between groups. Severe preclampsia appears to be a more intensely vasoconstricted state than mild preeclampsia. Although CI is inversely proportional to SVRI, increased HR in severe preeclampsia prevents this expected decrease in cardiac output.",preeclampsia
"The preeclampsia is one of the most serious complications in the second half of the pregnancy with a high risk of perinatal maternal and neonatal mortality. The study is aiming to determine which pregnant women have a higher risk of developing preeclampsia with a view to the subsequent antenatal care, on the base of the individual factors. Material and metods: From prospectively followed pacients is collected information by a questionnaire and sonographic examination at 11-13 weeks of gestation/w.g./ + 6 days, at the point of biochemical screening implementation. Selected is a group of women with one fetus pregnancy, non-smokers, without chromosomal and structural anomalies of the fetus, excluding those taking prophylactic low-dose of aspirin. The Doppler examination was transabdominaly performed on the ascending branch of the A. Uterina at the level of OICC.Pusatility and resistance index /Pi and Ri/ are bilaterally evaluated and converted to MoM for the relevant age of gestation. Results: The information about the taken values of Pi, Ri, the presence of diastolic incisures and the development of preeclampsia /PE/ or pregnancy indused hypertension /PIH/ is analyzed at 205 pregnant women. Out of them high values of Pi have 9 pregnant women, who subsequently developed PE or PlH. Conclusions: The measurement of Pi at 12-13 weeks of gestation and presence of diastolic incisures have prognostic importance for the development of PE in the later period of pregnancy. The values of Ri, taken at 12-13 weeks of gestation have not essential importance in the forecast of preeclamsia development.",preeclampsia
"In severe preeclampsia, delivery is assisted immediately without thinking in fetal conditions. Some decades ago, there is agreement to hospitalize, but there is no agreement between expectant or aggressive management. Here are revised these two management evidence based medicine. Fifteen non randomized non controlled trials in English and 4 in Latin American literature highlight 10-14 days pregnancy prolongation without increase maternal morbidity with conservative management; but there were criticized by non random patient selection and non controlled. Two randomized controlled trials showed improvement in neonatal results with no change in maternal, with expectant management. One systematic review of these two trials concluded there is not sufficient data to any reliable recommendation and proposes longer trials are necessary. In United States, National Working Group in the High Blood Pressure Educational Program believes expectant management is only possible in selective women group between 23-32 weeks. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist recommends this management in a tertiary care setting or in consultation with an obstetrician-gynecologist with training in high risk pregnancies. Expectant management present proposal in severe preeclampsia remote from term is summarized.",preeclampsia
Blood pressure and leucocyte sodium content were measured in black Jamaican patients with pre-eclampsia and pregnant controls. Similar measurements were made in a group of mothers who had pre-eclampsia 36-38 weeks previously and their controls. An increase in cell sodium accompanied the high blood pressure in patients with pre-eclampsia. There was also some elevation of both blood pressure and cell sodium in patients who had had pre-eclampsia 36-38 weeks previously. These findings suggest that disturbances of cellular electrolytes continue into the post-partum period. Changes in intracellular sodium may be important in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia as they parallel the increase in blood pressure levels.,preeclampsia
"The coevolution of genomics and proteomics has led to advancements in the field of diagnosis and molecular mechanisms of disease. Proteomics is now stepping into the field of obstetrics, where early diagnosis of pregnancy complication such as preeclampsia (PE) is imperative. PE is a multifactorial disease characterized by hypertension with proteinuria, which is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality occurring in 5-7% of pregnancies worldwide. This review discusses the probable molecular mechanisms that lead to PE and summarizes the proteomics research carried out in understanding the pathogenicity of PE, and for identifying the candidate biomarker for diagnosis of the disease.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To test the hypothesis that parameters of vascularity and flow intensity of the placenta as determined by three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, (1) are different in normal pregnancy compared to pre-eclampsia (2) decrease from the basal plate towards the chorionic plate. Methods: Twenty women with normal pregnancy and 17 women with pre-eclampisa were studied. 3D power Doppler ultrasound was used to acquire individual placental volumes. Rotational measurements of placental volumes were acquired using virtual organ computer aided analysis (VOCAL). The power Doppler signals were then semi-quantified within 'histogram facility', which generates three vascularity and flow intensity parameters: flow index (FI), vascular index (VI) and vascularisation flow index (VFI). Results: FI, VI and VFI were lower in pre-eclampsia compared to normal pregnancy in all regions of the placenta. This difference was statistically significant in most regions of the placenta after accounting for gestational age, body mass index and placental site. We were not able to demonstrate a decreasing gradient of these parameters from basal plate to chorionic plate. Conclusion: 3D ultrasound to assess placental vascularity and flow intensity appears to be an interesting research tool. However, other indices derived from Power Doppler may be more relevant to obstetric practice.",preeclampsia
"The therapeutic effect of the calcium antagonist; Nifedipine was assessed in 30 patients with pre-eclampsia. Cases were randomly allocated into two groups; a study group (n = 20) who received Nifedipine capsules (20 mg every 8 h for 7 days) and a control group (n = 10) who received placebo capsules with the same regimen. After Nifedipine administration, there was a significant decrease in blood pressure, serum urea and creatinine and 24 h urinary proteins. No significant difference was found in FHR and S/D ratio of the umbilical artery between study and control groups or between initial values and after Nifedipine administration. Preliminary results indicated that Nifedipine decreased blood pressure and improved kidney functions without affecting the umbilical artery blood flow in cases of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"It has been suggested that the origins of pre-eclampsia arise from the maternal venous system dysfunction. This study aimed to test this hypothesis by assessing hepatic perfusion in pre-eclampsia using three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound. The hepatic portal vein flow in 12 women with normal pregnancy and 11 women with pre-eclampsia was measured using standard Doppler ultrasound. The 3D indices of hepatic perfusion: flow index (FI), vascular index (VI) and vascularisation flow index (VFI), which are believed to reflect vascularity and flow intensity were also measured. Because of small numbers, a non-parametric test was used to test differences between groups. Hepatic portal vein flow was no different between women with normal pregnancy compared with women with pre-eclampsia (228.1 (215.5-270.6) vs. 283.0 (145.9-344.6); p = 0.90). The 3D indices of hepatic perfusion were as follows (FI: 36.3(30.7-42.5) vs. 39.7 (27.7-44.2), p = 1.00; VI: 11.7 (3.6-21.2) vs. 3.0 (0.5-7.6), p = 0.04; VFI: 4.7 (1.2-8.3) vs. 1.2 (0.1-3.2), p = 0.06, respectively). This study was not able to support or refute the suggestion that the genesis of pre-eclampsia arises from the maternal venous circulation. There may be biological differences in the 3D indices of hepatic perfusion in women with pre-eclampsia compared with normal pregnant women.",preeclampsia
"Objective: The objective of our study was to test the hypothesis that treatment with nifedipine for mild preeclampsia remote from term reduces the number of days of maternal hospitalization and improves pregnancy outcome. Study design: A total of 200 patients at 26 to 36 weeks' gestation were randomly allocated to treatment with either bed rest alone (n = 100) or bed rest in combination with nifedipine (n = 100). Results: Patients receiving nifedipine had significantly lower systolic (p < 0.0001) and diastolic (p < 0.0001) blood pressures during therapy. Severe hypertension as an indication for delivery was significantly (p < 0.05) more frequent in the bed-rest-alone group. The two study groups had similar average days of maternal hospitalization (12.6 +/- 7.9 vs 12.3 +/- 10.3) and pregnancy prolongation (22.3 +/- 13.5 vs 22.5 +/- 15.7). There were no differences between groups with respect to birth weight, incidences of small-for-gestational-age infants and preterm birth, number of days spent in special care unit, or cord blood gas measurement. Conclusion: Nifedipine therapy for preeclampsia reduces maternal blood pressure but does not reduce number of days of maternal hospitalization or improve perinatal outcome.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Examine whether dichorionic (DC) and monochorionic (MC) twins exhibit different rates and severity of preeclampsia. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of 695 twin pregnancies from 2002 to 2007. DC pregnancies were compared to MC pregnancies, with the primary outcome of interest being development of preeclampsia, and the secondary outcome being severity of preeclampsia. Chi square test compared proportions and multivariable analyses controlled for potential confounders. Results: Any preeclampsia developed in 21.1% (104/492) of DC and 10.8% (22/203) of MC pregnancies (p = 0.001), mild preeclampsia in 13.8% (68/492) of DC and 4.9% (10/203) of MC pregnancies (p = 0.001) and severe preeclampsia in 7.3% (36/492) of DC and 5.9% (12/203) of MC pregnancies (p = 0.506). DC pregnancies showed higher odds of mild preeclampsia compared to MC pregnancies (aOR 5.85, 95% CI 1.31-26.13) after controlling for several potential confounders including gestational age at delivery. Conclusions: A statistically significant larger proportion of women with DC twins developed any preeclampsia, and specifically mild preeclampsia, compared to those with MC twins. Additionally, after controlling for several potential confounders, women with DC pregnancies demonstrated higher odds of developing mild preeclampsia compared to those with MC pregnancies. Mechanisms of preeclampsia development may differ by twin chorionicity.",preeclampsia
"Hypertension in pregnancy is generally defined as either an absolute BP > 140/90 mm Hg or a rise in systolic BP > or = 25 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP > or = 15 mm Hg from pre-conception or 1st trimester BP. Hypertension in pregnancy is classified as: a) Chronic--essential or secondary hypertension, b) De novo--pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension, and c) Pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder in which hypertension is but one sign. The major maternal abnormalities occur in kidneys, liver, brain and coagulation systems. Impaired uteroplacental blood flow causes fetal growth retardation or intrauterine death. There is general agreement that BP > or = 170/110 mm Hg should be lowered rapidly to protect the mother against risk of stroke or eclampsia. There is dispute concerning the level at which lesser degrees of hypertension should be treated, and lowering BP is treating only one aspect of pre-eclampsia. Delivery remains the definitive management.",preeclampsia
"The classical diagnosis of preeclampsia is usually based on the fulfillment of 3 criteria: pregnancy > 20 weeks of gestation, proteinuria (2+ on dipstick or > 300 mg/24 h) and arterial hypertension ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. The current blood pressure cut off of 140/90 mm Hg was set by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG)-issued practice bulletin of 2019, the 2013 Task Force and the guidelines prompted by the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP). The evidence on which the current cut-off is based is scarce and not updated. We propose the application of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines on pregnant women and defining preeclampsia with the new 130/80 blood pressure cut-off.",preeclampsia
"Background: Tissue factor (TF) is a key element for normal gestation, especially in the first trimester. TF levels are hence raised in pregnancy, producing an adaptive hypercoagulable state. Potentiated hypercoagulability however, is associated with disorders of pregnancy such as pre-eclampsia but the results of TF and its inhibitor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), measurement, in pre eclampsic women are ambiguous and the data conflicting. This review covers the current knowledge status of the role of TF assessment in pregnancy with a focus on its diagnostic utility. Methods: A review of the literature using the following key words: tissue factor, thrombosis, inflammation, pregnancy, preeclampsia. Results: The published literature shows raised and unchanged TF levels in various studies of pre-eclampsia along with equally conflicting data for TFPI. The various study designs and methods used in these studies makes valid comparison difficult. Meta analysis of 34 randomized trials showed that low-dose aspirin in early phases of gravidity (starting from the 16th week or earlier) significantly reduces the incidence of preeclampsia. Conclusions: Overall, the results of the literature search together with knowledge of the structure and biological effects of TF, suggest that measuring the level of plasma TF/TFPI is not ideal for determining the actual levels of TF in the uteroplacental circulation. The current view that endothelial dysfunction is the trigger for preeclampsia, suggests that aspirin may be an effective prophylaxis. Further research will be necessary: measuring the expression of tissue factor on monocytes using flowcytometry and comparing the development of this expression during normal pregnancy and pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia, for example. Another possibility is immunohistochemical determination of the level of TF expression directly in placental tissue.",preeclampsia
"Systemic hypertension, preeclampsia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are diseases of high blood pressure in the systemic or pulmonary circulation. Beyond the well-defined contribution of more traditional pathophysiological mechanisms, such as changes in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, to the development of these hypertensive disorders, there is substantial clinical evidence supporting an important role for inflammation and immunity in the pathogenesis of each of these three conditions. Over the last decade, work in small animal models, bearing targeted deficiencies in specific cytokines or immune cell subsets, has begun to clarify the immune-mediated mechanisms that drive changes in vascular structure and tone in hypertensive disease. By summarizing the clinical and experimental evidence supporting a contribution of the immune system to systemic hypertension, preeclampsia, and PAH, the current review highlights the cellular and molecular pathways that are common to all three hypertensive disorders. These mechanisms are centered on an imbalance in CD4+ helper T cell populations, defined by excessive Th17 responses and impaired Treg activity, as well as the excessive activation or impairment of additional immune cell types, including macrophages, dendritic cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. The identification of common immune mechanisms in systemic hypertension, preeclampsia, and PAH raises the possibility of new therapeutic strategies that target the immune component of hypertension across multiple disorders.",preeclampsia
"Introduction: Women with persistently high resistance in uterine arteries have an increased risk of the subsequent development of preeclampsia. Doppler investigation provides a non-invasive method for the study of the uteroplacental blood flow. In pregnant women the antiphospholipid syndrome is associated to an increased risk of preeclampsia and complications related to uteroplacental insufficiency, and the role of uterine artery Doppler is discussed. Current knowledge and key points: In normal pregnancy, impedance to flow in the uterine arteries decreases with gestation, as the likely consequence of the physiologic change of spiral arteries into low-resistance vessels. In women with preeclampsia or related complications, the abnormal persistence of high resistance to flow in the uterine arteries correlates with maternal and neonatal outcome. In one study including patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, a high resistance index in the uterine arteries at 22-24 weeks gestation strongly predicted the subsequent development of preeclampsia. In another study including patients with lupus anticoagulant, persistent bilateral notches at 22-24 weeks gestation may identify preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction with a high sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value. The treatment may improve the uteroplacental blood flow and is a possible confounding factor which needs further evaluation. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS; In patients with antiphospholipid antibodies a higher impedance has been observed in the uterine artery, suggesting a possible vascular dysfunction precluding to impaired trophoblastic invasion and placental thrombosis, as probable mechanisms in the complications. If confirmed, these findings might have important implications for the management of these patients.",preeclampsia
"Hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, especially Pre-eclampsia is one of the major causes of increased maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality all over the world. Early prediction of pre-eclampsia is the need of modern obstetrics, as this can timely prevent the progress of disease as well as related fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. In addition to the screening of fetal aneuploidies, Rhesus-D status, fetal sex, single gene disorders, the cell-free fetal Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) quantification has emerged as a promising biomarker for the prediction of pre-eclampsia. Hence, its use can help in the early prediction of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, especially pre-eclampsia even before the appearance of symptoms. Furthermore, in future, it can also help in the determination of the complete DNA sequence of every gene of the fetus. The present review focuses on recent literature concerning the use of cell-free fetal DNA in early prediction of preeclampsia as well as for non-invasive prenatal genetic screening of fetus for various disorders. Methods: The recent literature related to cell-free fetal DNA was searched from numerous English language journals and published peer-reviewed articles on Pubmed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE and various government agencies till 2016.",preeclampsia
"Introduction: We compared renal perfusion in normal pregnant women and women with pre-eclampsia using three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound. We measured the flow index (FI), vascular index (VI) and vascularisation flow index (VFI) which are believed to reflect vascularity and flow intensity. Methods: Fourteen patients with normal pregnancy and 16 patients with pre-eclampsia were recruited. Imaging was conducted using a Voluson E8 machine and a 6-MHz trans-abdominal probe. The inferior border of the maternal left kidney was scanned. Volumes were acquired using 3D power Doppler angiography (3D-PDA). The FI, VI and VFI were generated using 'histogram' facility. Results: Maternal characteristics between normal pregnant women and women with pre-eclampsia were not different in terms of maternal age, gestation or body mass index. Depth of insonnation was not different between groups. The FI, VI and the VFI were not different between groups. The mean (SD) for FI was 27.9 (7.4) vs. 27.1 (6.5) between women with normal pregnancy vs. women with pre-eclampsia. For VI, mean (SD) was 72.3(31.6) vs. 79.4 (28.7) respectively. For VFI, mean (SD) was 20.8 (10.8) vs. 20.8 (8.1) respectively. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, no statistical differences between groups were apparent. There was no correlation between FI measurements and maternal creatinine (Pearson's R square = 0.04; p = 0.45) or with maternal urea levels (Pearson's R square = 0.20; p = 0.10). Conclusion: Using 3D ultrasound, we failed to demonstrate a difference in maternal renal perfusion in normal pregnancy compared to pre-eclampsia. The lack of observed difference may be a reflection of the high variability in 3D measurements (i.e. poor investigative tool) rather than a true lack of difference in renal perfusion.",preeclampsia
"Aims: To investigate the frequency of three apolipoprotein E (apoE) alleles among women with pre-eclampsia. Methods: The presence of the three most common apoE alleles (epsilon 2, epsilon 3, epsilon 4) was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in two groups of women: healthy pregnant women (n = 91) and pregnant women with a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia (n = 133). In addition, the frequencies of the alleles in the general population in this area are presented for comparison. Results: The frequency of the apo epsilon 4 allele was 18.4% among women with pre-eclampsia and 18.7% among healthy pregnant women (Fisher's exact test; p = 0.941), which is close to the rate in the general population in this area (19%). None of the apolipoprotein E genotypes was significantly over-represented, and homozygous genotype epsilon 4 was not associated with more severe clinical disease than were the other genotypes. Conclusion: The observed profiles of allele and genotype frequencies confirm an equilibrium state between apoE polymorphism and pre-eclampsia and suggest that apoE does not play a major role in the development of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: To determine: 1. whether an alternative definition of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia stratifies women according to their risk of maternal and fetal complications; 2. whether pregnancy outcome in women with gestational hypertension differs in the presence or absence of '+' proteinuria; and 3. whether a blood pressure rise of > or = 30/15 mmHg during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcome in women who remain normotensive. Design: Prospective, nested case-control study. Setting: Community based. Population: Healthy, nulliparous women (n = 1496). Methods: Women recruited into a study investigating serum markers predictive of pre-eclampsia were classified as having gestational hypertension (systolic blood pressure > or = 140 mmHg with a rise of > or = 30 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mmHg with a rise of > or = 15 mmHg) or pre-eclampsia (gestational hypertension plus proteinuria > or = 2+on dipstick or > 0.3 g/24 h). Maternal and fetal complications in gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia were compared with a control group of 223 randomly selected normotensive women. The main outcome measures were severe maternal disease, preterm birth and small for gestational age infant. Results: A stepwise increase in adverse maternal and fetal outcomes occurred in gestational hypertension (n = 117, 7.8%) and pre-eclampsia (n = 71, 4.8%). Severe maternal disease developed in 26.5% (21.4% severe hypertension alone, 5.1% multisystem disease) of women with gestational hypertension and 63.4% (21.1% severe hypertension alone, 42.3% multisystem disease) of women with pre-eclampsia (OR 4.8; 95% CI 2.4-9.5). Preterm birth and small for gestational age infants were more frequent in gestational hypertension (OR 1.7; 95% CI 0.5-5.4, and OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.0-3.7, respectively) and pre-eclampsia (OR 14.6; 95% CI 5.8-37.8, and OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.2-5.3) than in the normotensive group. Among women with gestational hypertension severe maternal disease was more common in women with '+' proteinuria (41.7%) than in those with no proteinuria (15.9%): OR 3.8; 95% CI 1.5-9.8. Pregnancies were uncomplicated in the 27% of normotensive women who had a rise of > or = 30 mmHg systolic blood pressure and/or > or = 15 mmHg rise in diastolic blood pressure. Conclusions: In the nulliparous population studied our definition of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia identified women at increasing risk of maternal and fetal complications. In gestational hypertension, the presence of proteinuria '+' was associated with a 3.8-fold increase in severe maternal disease. Normotensive women who have a rise in blood pressure > or = 30/15 mmHg had uncomplicated pregnancies.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To compare the prevalence of pre-eclampsia in migrant women with Norwegian women, and to study the prevalence of pre-eclampsia by length of residence in Norway. Design: Observational study. Setting: The Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Population: All Norwegian, Pakistani, Vietnamese, Somali, Sri Lankan, Filipino, Iraqi, Thai and Afghan women who gave birth after 20 weeks of gestation during the period 1986-2005 in Norway. Methods: The prevalence of pre-eclampsia was calculated by country of birth. The association of country of birth and length of residence in Norway with pre-eclampsia was estimated as the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using Norwegian women as a reference. We made adjustments for maternal age, parity, multifetal pregnancy, year of delivery and maternal diabetes in multivariable analysis. Main outcome measure: Pre-eclampsia. Results: Migrant women had a lower prevalence of pre-eclampsia than Norwegian women (2.7% versus 3.7%, P < 0.001). Vietnamese (OR, 0.36; CI, 0.29-0.45), Afghan (OR, 0.52; CI, 0.30-0.90) and Thai (OR, 0.57; CI, 0.45-0.73) women had the lowest risk of pre-eclampsia relative to Norwegian women. Adjustment for the variables above or separate analyses for nulliparous women did not change the estimates notably. Using Norwegian women as the reference, the risk of pre-eclampsia increased by length of residence for migrant women: adjusted OR of 0.64 (0.59-0.70) at <5 years and 0.91 (0.84-0.99) at ≥5 years of residence. Conclusions: The risk of pre-eclampsia was lower in migrants relative to Norwegian women, but increased by length of residence in Norway.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: Abnormal secretion of P-type inositol phosphoglycans (IPG-P) has been described in maternal urine of pre-eclamptic women. The aim of this study was to determine the origin of production of IPG-P. We examined the IPG-P content of maternal and fetal serum, maternal urine and amniotic fluid in both normal pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. Design: Established extraction and bioactivity assay techniques were used to compare total IPG-P levels in serum samples, and a polyclonal-antibody-based ELISA to assay the amniotic fluid and urine samples in matched pairs of women. Subjects: Eleven women with pre-eclampsia requiring caesarean section (subjects), 11 pregnant women requiring elective caesarean section for reasons other than pre-eclampsia (controls). Results: Our data confirm the abnormal level of IPG-P in maternal urine during pre-eclampsia. Moreover, IPG-P levels were higher in umbilical sera than in maternal sera samples. Amniotic fluid as well as urine ELISA results were significantly higher in the pre-eclamptic group compared with normal controls. Total IPG-P bioactivity in serum did not vary between serum compartments in normal pregnancy. Uterine vein IPG-P levels were lower in pre-eclampsia when compared with normal pregnancy. A possible correlation was observed between urine and amniotic fluid levels in normal women. No correlation was observed between measured blood levels and those in urine and amniotic fluid. Conclusions: It is hypothesized that steady state equilibrium of IPG-P in serum in normal pregnancy is disrupted in pre-eclampsia. Additionally, an abnormal IPG-P sub-fraction, detectable in urine and amniotic fluid, may be present and involved in the pathophysiology of the syndrome, although sites of production of this abnormal form remain unclear.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy characterized by hypertension with proteinuria after twenty weeks gestation. The condition is an important cause of both maternal and infant mortality worldwide. One potential risk factor for preeclampsia that has been studied in a variety of countries and climates is time of the year of delivery. Several studies have reported a significant seasonality to preeclampsia, but their specific findings are contradictory. Interestingly, the places where much of this research occurred were comprised of populations whose race was fairly homogeneous. Further, a recent large scale study of preeclampsia in the United States separated out the women by race and reported a seasonality for white women, but not for black women. We performed a retrospective review of three years of hospital records for a medical center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in order to search for evidence of a possible correlation between incidence of preeclamptic deliveries and month of the year. Our population was comprised of various ethnicities, but race was not included in the charts and could not be taken into consideration. Although the study was sufficiently powered, neither analysis of variance nor contingency table analysis revealed a significant seasonality of preeclamptic deliveries, (P=0.9489 and 0.9549, respectively). Given the reported contradictory findings for various homogeneous populations, the finding of differences of seasonality of preeclampsia between blacks and whites in a large US study, and the lack of evidence for seasonality of preeclampsia in our diverse sample study, we conclude that the seasonality of preeclampsia deliveries may be influenced by genetic differences related to race. Future research should focus on separating out study participants by racial and ethnic backgrounds. If another identifiable risk factor for this dangerous condition exists, even for only a particular subset of a population, its identification can help physicians to more quickly recognize and respond to the disorder.",preeclampsia
"Problem: We have previously found that C1q is constitutively expressed by invading trophoblast and endothelial cells of decidua and contributes to vascular and tissue remodeling. Based on these findings, we sought to determine whether there were changes in the circulating level of C1q that may be used as a diagnostic and predictive marker of preeclampsia. Method of study: We measured the levels of C1q, C4, and complement activation products in serum or plasma of normal pregnant women and preeclamptic patients from different cohorts. Results: We observed a marked decrease in the concentration of C1q associated with a reduced level of C4 in preeclamptic patients as compared to matched healthy pregnant woman but no significant difference in the circulating level of the activating products C5a and the soluble terminal complement complex sC5b-9. Analysis of serum samples collected at early phase of pregnancy from women who later developed preeclampsia failed to show a decrease in C1q level. Conclusion: The results of the present investigation demonstrate that low levels of C1q and C4 are associated with preeclampsia but cannot be used as predictive markers.",preeclampsia
"Mild or severe preeclampsia is responsible for about 70% of hypertensive disorders observed during pregnancy and 24 h urine collection is a gold standard for diagnosis ofpreeclampsia. This study was performed to determine whether the gold standard of 24 h urine protein value in pre-eclampsia can be substituted with 8 or 12 h urine protein values and to evaluate the effect of ambulation and immobilization on amount of protein excretion. A cross sectional study was conducted on 40 women with pre-eclampsia (BP > or = 140/90 mmHg), who referred to the Department of Obstetric and Gynecology, Imam Khomeiny hospital in Sari, Iran from April 2005 to September 2005. Positive urinary strip for protein of at least 1+ samples were collected over 24 h in subsequent periods: the first 8 h and the next 4 h and remaining 12 h urine, in separate containers. The correlation between groups was determined by Pearson's correlation. A total of 40 women were recurited in this study of which 36 had completed urine collection. A total of 21 had mild proteinuria, 5 had severe proteinuria and 10 had no proteinuria. There was significant correlation between the 8 or 12 h (day) and 12 h (night) with 24 h urine protein. Total protein values of 8 and 12 h (day) and 12 h (night) samples, positively correlated with values of 24 h samples in pre-eclampsia and could be substituted for assessment of proteinuria instead of 24 h urine collection in women with pre-eclampsia, as a simpler, faster and cheaper method for diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. And ambulation and immobilization in preeclamptic patients has not any effect on protein excretion.",preeclampsia
"Two case histories are described with conflicting implications for the etiopathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. In both, typical proteinuric pre-eclampsia developed despite a history of previous normotensive pregnancy. In the first case, the disease was associated with a change of husband, consistent with the view that pre-eclampsia arises from an inadequate maternal immune response to paternal antigens inherited by the fetus. The second case, however, concerned a woman who developed pre-eclampsia for the first time in her third pregnancy by the same reproductive partner. We conclude that either more than one underlying cause can result in the clinical syndrome of pre-eclampsia, or that pre-eclampsia is caused by an environmental factor. The possibility that pre-eclampsia may be initiated by an infectious agent is briefly explored in the light of the clinical histories described and well-established epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a multi systemic syndrome of variable severity, pregnancy specific, consequence of an abnormal vascular response to placentation, with increase in peripheral vascular resistance, stimulation of platelet aggregation, activation of the coagulation cascade, and endothelial dysfunction. In the majority of cases, it will present with gestational hypertension and proteinuria, after 20 weeks, nevertheless, in other cases, it has presented as an atypical form (with absence of hypertension and/or proteinuria) behaving like severe preeclampsia. We report the case of a patient, 32 year old primigravida, with a 26.6 weeks gestation, that comes to the office with postprandial projectile vomiting. At the time of admission, she presents with sudden headache, phosphenes, and tinnitus, associated to epigastric pain, with a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg; fetal heart rate of 146 bpm, normal lower limbs and reflexes. The Complete Blood Count and liver function tests are within normal values, urinalysis with proteinuria. Normal hepatic ultrasound. Obstetric ultrasound; with fetal measurements of 2.6 weeks below, with flattening of the growth curve, Doppler flowmetry with an increase in placental resistance and oligohydramnios. Given the clinical manifestations compatible with severe preeclampsia, magnesium sulfate, and antenatal corticosteroid therapy are initiated, and abdominal termination of pregnancy is decided. A female newborn is obtained, of 595 g, Apgar 4/7. On immediate puerperium, she presents with an increase in blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg, discharged with normal blood pressure 96 hours later. The newborn girl was discharged when she reached a weight of 2000 g. Today, she is neurologically unimpaired.",preeclampsia
"Background and aims: Pre-eclampsia constitutes a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Pre-eclampsia susceptibility is believed to be associated with altered lipid profiles and abnormal lipid metabolism via lipid peroxidation that leads to endothelial dysfunction. The goal of this study was to evaluate the association of maternal blood lipid and apolipoprotein levels with pre-eclampsia in a large-scale study. Methods: Using data from a large case-control study (1366 cases of pre-eclampsia and 1741 normotensive controls), the association between the distributions of eight lipid fractions and pre-eclampsia risk was evaluated using adjusted logistic regression models. Pre-eclampsia was defined as blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg and proteinuria ≥300 mg/24 h (>1 + dipstick). Sub-group analyses were conducted for early (<34 weeks) and late (≥37 weeks) pre-eclampsia, estimating the effect of 1 standard deviation increase in log-transformed lipid fraction levels in adjusted multinomial regression models. Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, concentrations of triglycerides, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and the relationship between apolipoprotein B and A1 (ApoB/ApoA1) showed the strongest associations with pre-eclampsia, particularly for those cases with an early onset. Conclusions: Higher levels of triglycerides, ApoE and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio are associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Further studies that allow for a causal inference are needed to confirm or refute the aetiological role of blood lipids in pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Severe preeclampsia and eclampsia are major causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world. One of the uncommon effects of severe preeclampsia on the eye is sudden loss of vision. This blindness can be due to involvement of the occipital cortex or the retina. Although very alarming, this type of blindness is usually reversible following appropriate management of such patients. Here we present the case of a woman in whom fulminating preeclampsia was complicated by blindness. Fundoscopic findings were bilateral papillo edema and macular edema. She responded well to therapy, which included antihypertensives, seizure prophylaxis and operative delivery. Vision was restored by the third day.",preeclampsia
"From the pre-natal follow-up it was remarkable that cases have been admitted relatively late. Hints to a possible development of preeclampsia could be seen from patients history or the routine check up, for example the registration of edema, fetal growth retardation and oligohydramnios. For early diagnosis of preeclampsia we recommend: Calculation of mean arterial blood pressure or its non-invasive measurement; determination of hematocrit, uric acid and total plasma protein (in particular hemorheologic measurements). Hypomagnesemia in preeclampsia, as described by some authors, was also seen in our cases. The complex symptomatology of preeclampsia could be attributed to a generalised disturbance of microcirculation, which leads to definite reactions of the organs concerned. The microcirculatory failure is caused by vasoconstriction, hemoconcentration, hyperviscosity and hypercoagulation (up to DIC and consumption coagulopathy). The resulting symptoms and syndromes can be: EPH, HELLP, hemolytic-uremic Syndrome, hepato-renal Syndrome, thrombocyte and antithrombin III deficiency etc. The drug of choice for treatment of preeclampsia is magnesium sulfate. Its application is based on long-term clinical experience and new aspects on the physiologic and pharmacologic role of magnesium. The recommendations of the German High Blood Pressure League to use calcium antagonists as a basis in the treatment of high blood pressure can be fulfilled particularly in pregnancy by the physiologic calcium antagonist Mg++. Magnesium sulfate should be given in a dosage of 24-72 g daily. The dose should also be made dependent from urinary output. Further treatment patterns of preeclampsia should be adjusted according to each case. The present results also support our hypothesis that magnesium deficiency (besides predisposing factors) could be responsible for the development of preeclampsia (present model shown in detail). Consequently, the early and long-term substitution of magnesium in pregnancy could help reduce preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"In this case-control study, we assessed the influence of IL-10 -1082A/G and -819T/C on the development of preeclampsia. The IL-10 -1082A/G and -819T/C polymorphisms were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The genotype distributions of the IL-10 -1082A/G and -819T/C polymorphisms in the control subjects were in conformance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE; P = 0.46 and 0.17). Unconditional logistic regression analyses revealed that individuals carrying the CC genotype of IL-10 -819T/C were associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia compared to the TT genotype. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the CC genotype of IL-10 -819T/C was 1.71 (1.07-3.27) compared to the TT genotype. In conclusion, the results of our study indicated that the IL-10 -819T/C polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia in a Chinese population.",preeclampsia
"Traditionally, preeclamptic women who meet accepted criteria for severe disease are delivered expeditiously, regardless of gestational age. Although delivery is always appropriate therapy for the mother, it may not be optimal for the fetus remote from term. Several recent randomized clinical trials support expectant management of severe preeclampsia remote from term in well-selected patients. We have described our rationale and guidelines for management, which we believe should be performed only at tertiary perinatal centers.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To assess the role of uterine artery (UtA) Doppler to predict superimposed preeclampsia in women with chronic hypertension. Methods: In a cohort of 182 women with chronic hypertension, UtA Doppler studies were performed before 25 weeks (mean 19.7 +/- 2.1 weeks) and repeated later in pregnancy (mean 28.5 +/- 3.7 weeks). Results: The incidence of preeclampsia was 13% (24/182). Rates of preeclampsia increased with advancing gestation of abnormal UtA Doppler: 7% when UtA Doppler were normal at early exam, 18% when abnormal at early exam, and 28% when abnormal at late exam (Chi-square for trend: P < 0.001). The rate of preeclampsia among 40 women with abnormal early but normal late UtA Doppler was similar to that of women with normal findings at early exam (8 vs 7%; P = 1.00). Logistic regression analysis showed that the ability of UtA Doppler to predict preeclampsia was independent from other variables [Odds Ratio (OR) 7.1, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.6-18.9). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve identified a UtA value of 0.58 as the optimal threshold for the prediction of preeclampsia. Conclusion: The later in pregnancy the abnormal UtA Doppler findings are observed, the greater the risk of preeclampsia. Normalization of UtA Doppler after 25 weeks reduces the risk of preeclampsia to 8%.",preeclampsia
"Headings aim: We aimed to investigate if the let-7 s expression level in the serum of peripheral blood from pregnant women with severe pre-eclampsia and normal pregnant women is related to the incidence of severe pre-eclampsia. Methods: Total RNA was extracted from collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 20 or over weeks pregnant women diagnosed with severe pre-eclampsia (age: 31.57 ± 4.94) and normal pregnant women (age: 29.75 ± 4.6) respectively, followed by real-time PCR to examine the expression of let-7 s. Correlation between let-7 s expression level and maternal age or body mass index of the normal pregnant women were also analyzed using SPSS21.0 software. Results: Let-7a and let-7 g were significantly increased in pregnant women with severe pre-eclampsia by 4.67 fold and 2.37 fold respectively compared to the normal pregnant women, whereas there was no significant difference in let-7b and let-7i. Moreover, there was no correlation between maternal age or body mass index and the expression level of let-7a, let-7b, let-7 g, and let-7i. Conclusions: In conclusion, let-7a and let-7 g were significantly increased in the PBMCs of severe pre-eclampsia women compared to normal controls. Moreover, their expression level was not correlated to the maternal age or body mass of patients. Our data indicated that let-7a and let-7 g may be considered as predictive markers for SPE.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a significant, multifactorial, multiorgan disease affecting 6%-8% of all pregnancies in the United States and is the third leading cause of maternal mortality. As such, it is incumbent upon any anesthesia provider involved in obstetric cases to be familiar with the varied manifestations of the disease, management goals from an obstetric standpoint, and the implications for provision of anesthesia in this patient group. Despite improvements in the diagnosis and management of preeclampsia, severe complications can occur in both the mother and the fetus. A systematic approach to the anesthetic evaluation is therefore necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve outcomes. The potential pitfalls of general anesthesia, including failed intubation, in these complicated patients make regional anesthesia the preferred choice in many cases. Recent studies have shown that spinal anesthesia is often appropriate for preeclamptic patients, even in severe cases. Nevertheless, it is important to be aware of the potential contraindications to neuraxial anesthesia and to prepare for the possibility of encountering a difficult airway.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: To determine the association between ERAP2 rs2549782 and rs17408150 polymorphisms and pre-eclampsia among Iranian women. Methods: A retrospective case-control study comparing 319 women with pre-eclampsia and 291 normotensive pregnant Iranian women between January and August 2016. Pre-eclampsia was diagnosed by the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy's criteria. Demographic data were collected by oral interview. Genotyping was done by allele-specific PCR. Data were analyzed using SPSS v. 16. Results: The frequency of the rs2549782TT genotype was 31.0% and 27.5% among cases and controls, respectively (P=0.006). There was no difference in the frequency of the T allele between groups (P>0.05). Regarding the rs17408150 polymorphism, a high portion of women with pre-eclampsia was homozygous for the AA genotype (P<0.001). The frequency of the A allele was 32.5% and 25.05% among cases and controls, respectively (P=0.004). The combined haplotype of the rs2549782A and rs17408150G alleles was associated with increased risk of pre-eclampsia (P=0.031). Conclusion: ERAP2 gene polymorphisms were associated with the risk of pre-eclampsia in an Iranian population. The results provide further evidence of the role of ERAP2 in the pathophysiology of this disease.",preeclampsia
"Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of uric acid as a marker of severity of pre-eclampsia. Methods: Uric acid was measured in 36 pre-eclamptic pregnant women and 26 healthy pregnant women in the control group. Data regarding age, history of pre-eclampsia in previous pregnancies, family history of pre-eclampsia, pregnancy, and abortion were obtained through a questionnaire given to each pregnant woman, after signing the consent form. The route of delivery and weight of the newborns were obtained from medical records of patients. Statistical analyses used were the t-test and Fisher's exact test. Results: Uric acid was significantly higher and weight of neonates was significantly lower in pre-eclamptic women. Significant correlations between uric acid and systolic blood pressure, and uric acid and 24-hour proteinuria were observed. Inverse correlations between uric acid levels and weight of newborns and between systolic blood pressure and the weight of newborns were also observed. Conclusions: The results agree with other previous research, and reinforce the idea that the concentration of serum uric acid in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia is associated with disease severity and contributes to better monitoring of the mother and newborn.",preeclampsia
"Objective: The objective of this prospective, open, randomised trial was to determine the role of calcium supplementation in preventing pre-eclampsia. Methods: One hundred uncomplicated normotensive primigravidae were enrolled in the study before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Fifty each were randomised to receive either two gram elemental calcium daily from 20 weeks of gestation to delivery (study group) or no calcium supplementation (control group). Prior to 20 weeks of gestation each underwent a complete clinical and laboratory evaluation. Serum and urine calcium was measured first at 20 weeks of gestation and then at 24-28 weeks and at 32-36 weeks of pregnancy. Results: Patient characteristics at the start of therapy were similar in the two groups. Blood pressure profile was similar throughout pregnancy in the groups. The incidence of pre-eclampsia was similar (18% in the study group and 16% in the control group), but severe pre-eclampsia was significantly less in the study group. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regards to intra- and postpartum characteristics, perinatal outcome and maternal or fetal side effects. Serum and urinary calcium levels did not differ between the two groups. Conclusion: While calcium supplementation did not lower the incidence of pre-eclampsia it did reduce its severity.",preeclampsia
"The pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia is still not completely known; however, in the recent decade, there have been tremendous research efforts leading to impressive results highlighting the role of a disturbed angiogenic balance as one of the key features of the disease. Numerous studies have shown the key role of the placenta in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. A shift in the sFlt-1 (soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1)/PlGF (placental growth factor) ratio is associated with the disease. Although pre-eclampsia seems to be a clearly defined disease, clinical presentation, and particularly the dynamics of the clinical course, can vary enormously. The only available tools to diagnose pre-eclampsia are blood pressure measurement and urine protein sampling. However, these tools have a low sensitivity and specificity regarding the prediction of the course of the disease or maternal and perinatal outcomes. The only cure for the disease is delivery, although a timely diagnosis helps in decreasing maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The sFlt1/PlGF ratio is able to give additional valuable information on the status and progression of the disease and is apt to be implemented in the diagnostic algorithm of pre-eclampsia. In the present review, we aim to provide an overview of the vast literature on angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis factors in pre-eclampsia that have been published over the last decade. We introduce work from basic research groups who have focused on the pathophysiological basis of the disease. Furthermore, we review studies with a clinical focus in which the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio has been analysed along with other candidates for routine clinical assessment of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Aim: We have previously demonstrated that mRNA expression and enzyme activity levels of placental indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which degrades L-tryptophan and blocks the proliferation of T cells, are significantly low in patients with severe pre-eclampsia. From this observation, we hypothesized that induction of maternal allogeneic immune reaction by reduced IDO activity is one of the causes of pre-eclampsia. Methods: To examine this hypothesis, we administered an IDO inhibitor to pregnant female mice carrying allogeneic concepti. Since administration of an IDO inhibitor to pregnant mice starting at E4.5 is already reported to cause allogeneic fetal rejection, we modified the regimen and started the administration at E6.5 when the fetus and placenta have already been established. Results: Pregnant mice treated with an IDO inhibitor developed high blood pressure and proteinuria in addition to local circulation impairment in the placenta, which is analogous to the lesions that are characteristic of human pre-eclampsia. In contrast, pregnant mice carrying syngeneic concepti did not manifest such symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings reveal a pivotal role for IDO activity in the etiology of pre-eclampsia. These data also lend support to the current hypothesis that pre-eclampsia is one of the possible manifestations of a maternal immunological reaction against an allogeneic fetus.",preeclampsia
"Aims: To perform a systematic review of screening for pre-eclampsia (PE) with the combination of uterine artery Doppler (UAD), maternal history, mean arterial pressure and/or maternal serum markers. Methods: We identified eligible studies through a search of Medline, and, for each included study, we assessed the risk of bias and extracted relevant data. We reported the performance of screening tests according to the target population (low- or high-risk), the trimester of screening (first and/or second) and the subset of PE screened for (early and late). Results: Several tests provided moderate or convincing prediction of early PE, but screening for late PE was poor. Although UAD is more accurate in the second trimester, we found encouraging results for first-trimester screening when it was combined with other markers. Performance of screening was consistently lower in populations with risk factors for PE in the maternal history. Conclusions: We present encouraging results for the prediction of early PE, even in the first trimester of pregnancy. The different performance of tests in screening for early vs. late PE, and of low- vs. high-risk populations, supports the concept that PE is a heterogeneous disease.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To explore the different clinical onset patterns in severe preeclampsia. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in 173 cases of severe preeclampsia. They were divided into two groups according to the onset of gestational age of severe preeclampsia, early onset of severe preeclampsia (S-PE) (onset < or = 34 weeks) and late onset of S-PE (onset > 34 weeks). Then according to the onset pattern they were subdivided into 4 subgroups: early abrupt onset (10) and early onset with gradual progress of severe preeclampsia (87), late abrupt onset (18) and late onset with gradual progress of severe preeclampsia (58). Clinical characteristics in each subgroup were evaluated. Results: Cases with abrupt onset accounted for 16.2% out of 173 cases of severe preeclampsia (28/173). The incidence of abrupt onset or onset with gradual progress between early and late onset groups was not significantly different (P > 0.05). Whether in early onset group or late onset group, the incidence of serious maternal complications was much higher in abrupt onset subgroups than that in gradual progress subgroups [100.0% (10/10) vs 34.5% (30/87) and 100.0% (18/18) vs 29.3% (17/58); P < 0.001]. The incidence of serious maternal complications was not significantly different between early onset and late onset groups (P > 0.05). The perinatal mortality rate was higher in abrupt onset subgroups compared to gradual progress subgroups both in early onset groups and in late onset ones (72.7% vs 24.3%, P < 0.01; 22.2% vs 4.9%, P < 0.05). The perinatal mortality rate was higher in each subgroups in early onset groups than that in late onset ones respectively (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). The gestational age at delivery was closely associated with perinatal outcomes. When a delimitation of early onset of severe preeclampsia was set at 32-week gestation, perinatal outcome was associated with both gestational age at birth and the onset time of severe preeclampsia. If the cut-off point was set at 34-week gestation, perinatal outcome was associated only with gestational age at birth. Conclusions: Approximately 16% pregnant women with severe preeclampsia were attacked abruptly and complicated by serious complications. The clinical delimitation of early onset of severe preeclampsia set at 32-week gestation is significantly associated with poor maternal and perinatal outcomes.",preeclampsia
Elevation of the factor VIII protein to coagulant ratio previously has been reported to predict the severity of pre-eclampsia. Abnormal levels and patterns of factor VIII: von Willebrand factor (VIII/vWF) have been reported in thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP). Severe pre-eclampsia shares many features with this syndrome. Nine primigravid patients with pre-eclampsia were evaluated by assays for factor VIII/vWF protein and coagulant activity and were compared to nine normal primigravid (controls). The patients and controls were indistinguishable by factor VIII antigen/coagulant activity ratios. Pre-eclamptic patients also had unremarkable factor VIII patterns on crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The evaluation of factor VIII/vWF multimeric patterns showed four patients with abnormal patterns in the pre-eclamptic patients and three abnormal patterns in the controls. These patterns were not analogous to the factor VIII abnormalities found in TTP.,preeclampsia
"Based on ophthalmoscopic findings, 30 toxemic patients were divided into three types: R-type; retinal vascular occlusion type, C-type; choroidal vascular occlusion type, R + C-type; mixed vascular occlusion type. R-type (5 cases) and R + C-type (7 cases) significantly correlated to superimposed preeclampsia. C-type (18 cases) significantly correlated to preeclampsia (pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorder: PIH). Clinical examinations (urine protein, platelet, fibrinogen, fibrin degradation product, partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time) had no relation to the types of ophthalmoscopic classification. It was concluded that preeclampsia (PIH) and superimposed preeclampsia have different influences on the ocular fundus.",preeclampsia
"Background: To explore the possibility of serum leptin being a marker of severity of pre-eclampsia, so that risk of imminent eclampsia and eclampsia can be reduced. Methods: This observational study was conducted at a private hospital of Hyderabad from 31st July to 1st December 2007. Forty primipara with same age, body mass indices and gestational age were included in this study. Twenty women had raised blood pressure in third trimester of pregnancy and 20 women with a normal blood pressure in third trimester of pregnancy. The exclusion criteria included history of diabetes, twin pregnancy, chronic hypertension, liver or renal disease. After counselling and affordability of laboratory testing their blood sample was taken for serum leptin, uric acid, serum creatinine and urine for albumin. The serum leptin level was measured by radio-immunoassay (RIA) kits. All data was filled in a pre-designed proforma after taking detailed history and examination. Statistical analysis was performed on SPSS. Student's t-test was applied where applicable. Results: Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure between pre-eclamptic and control group showed a marked difference (p < 0.001) ranging from 149.50 +/- 3.44 and 104.40 +/- 3.03 as compared to control 107 +/- 1.56 and 74.50 +/- 1.49 respectively, similarly proteinuria was present in 20 (100%) cases of pre-eclampsia and 07 (35%) of normotensive women. Mean serum leptin level was significantly high in pre-eclampstic (79.380 +/- 3.287), when compared with a control group (27.825 +/- 1.050). Mean serum uric acid in pre-eclamptic (5.040 +/- 0.147) showed significant changes than control (3.600 +/- 0.141), while serum creatinine level was insignificant in both groups. It has been observed that Mean +/- SEM value of serum leptin level was much higher in severe pre-eclamptics (76.418 +/- 5.056) than in women with mild pre-eclampsia (40.856 +/- 2.807). All the parameters correlated positively and significantly with increased blood pressure. Conclusion: Elevated plasma leptin concentration appears to be a marker of pre-eclampsia independently or along with other parameters of pre-eclampsia could be used to reduce the severity of pre-eclampsia thus avoiding risk effects of pre-eclampsia to mother and foetus. This study still needs more research work to prove our results.",preeclampsia
"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare clinico-neuroradiologic condition, not commonly reported in the literature. PRES is an uncommon complication of severe preeclampsia/eclampsia. We report the management of one patient with postpartum preeclampsia as an association of HELLP syndrome presenting with status-epileptics. Early diagnosis along with timely supportive therapy resulted in the successful management of this challenging case. Recent understanding on the pathophysiology of this uncommon condition is discussed. We highlight the importance to obstetricians, intensive-care physicians and anesthesiologists of recognizing such cases.",preeclampsia
"Problem: Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a pattern-recognition receptor that activates complement and modulates inflammation. Homozygosity for the most common allele of the MBL2 gene that is associated with high MBL serum concentrations is more prevalent among patients with pre-eclampsia. The objective of this study was to determine maternal plasma MBL concentrations in normal pregnant women and patients with pre-eclampsia. Method of study: This cross-sectional study included normal pregnant women (n = 187) and patients with pre-eclampsia (n = 99). Maternal plasma MBL concentrations were determined by ELISA. Results: Women with pre-eclampsia had a higher median maternal plasma MBL concentration than normal pregnant women. MBL concentration distribution curves were three-modal, the subintervals in normal pregnancy were low (< 143.7), intermediate (143.7-1898.9) and high (> 1898.9 ng/mL). The proportion of normal pregnant women was larger in the low subinterval, while the proportion of patients with preeclampsia was larger in the high subinterval (P = 0.02). Normal pregnant women in the high subinterval had a larger rate of placental underperfusion than those in the low and intermediate subintervals (P = 0.02). Conclusions: The median maternal plasma MBL concentration is elevated in patients with pre-eclampsia and a larger proportion of these patients are in the high subinterval than normal pregnant women, suggesting that this component of the innate immune system is involved in the mechanisms of disease in pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pregnancy is known to induce rapid, progressive, and substantial changes to the cardiovascular system, ultimately facilitating successful pregnancy outcomes. Women who develop hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are considered to have ""failed"" the cardiovascular stress test of pregnancy and likely represent a subpopulation with inadequate cardiovascular accommodation. Preeclampsia is a serious complication with a myriad of manifestations in both mother and offspring. This pregnancy syndrome is a polygenic disease and has now been linked to a greater incidence of cardiovascular disease. Moreover, offsprings born to preeclamptic mothers exhibit an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and mental disorders during adulthood. This suggests that preeclampsia not only exposes the mother and the fetus to complications during pregnancy but also programs chronic diseases during adulthood in the offspring. The etiology of preeclampsia remains unknown, with various theories being suggested to explain its origin. It is primarily thought to be associated with poor placentation and entails excessive maternal inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. It is well established now that the maternal immune system and the placenta are involved in a highly choreographed cross talk that underlies adequate spiral artery remodeling required for uteroplacental perfusion and free flow of nutrients to the fetus. Although it is not clear whether immunological alterations occur early during pregnancy, studies have proposed that dysregulated systemic and placental immunity contribute to impaired angiogenesis and the onset of preeclampsia. Recently emerged strong evidence suggests a potential link among epigenetics, microRNAs (miRNAs), and pregnancy complications. This chapter will focus on important aspects of epigenetics, immunological aspects, and cardiovascular and vascular remodeling of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is the most menacing complication of pregnancy and childbirth worldwide and remains one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. It is characterized by a complex etiopathogenesis with specific clinical and laboratory changes (hypertension, proteinuria and edema), as well as by the morphological pattern of target organ damage and uteroplacental blood vascular lesions. However, the triad of clinical signs of preeclampsia is not encountered in all cases now. Objective: to study the clinical and anatomical aspects of preeclampsia at the present stage. Material and methods: 17 maternal deaths due to preeclampsia were studied at the medical institutions of the Moscow Healthcare Department from 2012 to the first half of 2017 through postmortem examination at City Clinical Hospital Thirty-One, Moscow Healthcare Department. Results: This analysis showed the atypical course of preeclampsia (without substantial blood pressure elevations, with mild/moderate proteinuria, but almost always with edema). The characteristic feature is a laboratory sign, such as thrombocytopenia and liver enzyme dysfunction. Morphological examination of deceased patients showed that almost half of the cases had brain hemorrhages of different localization and size; in most cases, renal changes corresponded to the pattern of a shock kidney with endotheliosis and frequently with cortical necroses. The liver was characterized by a considerable increase in size with the development of fatty dystrophy, centrolobular necroses and hemorrhages; there were metabolic damage foci in the heart in almost half of the cases, as well as signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation with numerous hemorrhages in the organs and tissues. Conclusion: Characteristic uteroplacental artery morphological changes in both the surgical and autopsy material render a leading assistance in the diagnosis of preeclampsia/eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To investigate whether interleukin-10 (IL-10) polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to pre-eclampsia. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between IL-10-1082 G/A, -819 C/T and -592 C/A polymorphisms and pre-eclampsia using allele contrast, a recessive model, a dominant model and an additive model. Results: Thirteen groups from 11 papers involving 1534 patients with pre-eclampsia and 2271 controls were considered in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of the IL-10-1082 G/A polymorphism in 3500 study subjects revealed no association between pre-eclampsia and the IL-10-1082 G allele [odds ratio (OR) 0.890, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.729-1.087; p=0.254]. Stratification by ethnicity indicated an association between the IL-10-1082 G allele and pre-eclampsia in the Iranian groups (OR 1.408, 95% CI 1.097-1.807; p=0.007), but not in the European groups (OR 0.759, 95% CI 0.506-1.136; p=0.180). Meta-analysis revealed an association between pre-eclampsia and the IL-10-819 C allele in all study subjects (OR 1.296, 95% CI 1.012-1.661; p=0.040), particularly among the Iranian groups (OR 1.390, 95% CI 1.067-1.811; p=0.015). Meta-analysis showed no association between pre-eclampsia and the IL-10-592 C allele (OR 1.215, 95% CI 0.967-1.527; p=0.094) in any groups, except for the Iranian groups (OR 1.380, 95% CI 1.056-1.805; p=0.018). However, the associations found in the meta-analysis became non-significant after exclusion of the studies in which the controls showed deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that IL-10-1082 G/A, -819 C/T and -592 C/A polymorphisms are unlikely to be important in susceptibility to pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is characterized by the onset of high blood pressure and proteinuria during pregnancy, which results in substantial maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Insulin resistance has been observed before the onset of preeclampsia, and is implicated in its pathophysiology. Recently, retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), which carries retinol in circulation, has been shown to be a potential regulator of insulin resistance originating from adipose tissue. Here we measured insulin resistance and RBP-4 levels in patients with preeclampsia and in women with normal pregnancies matched for gestational age and body mass index at Okayama University Hospital. Our aim was to examine the potential role of RBP4 in the pathophysiology of this disorder. There were no significant differences in RBP4 levels between all patients with preeclampsia and controls. However, the RBP4 level and homeostasis model assessment as an index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in overweight patients with late-onset preeclampsia were significantly higher than in overweight controls carrying normal pregnancies and in normal weight women with late-onset preeclampsia. In contrast, there were no significant differences between the overweight and normal weight groups among patients with early-onset preeclampsia and in healthy pregnant women. These data suggest that RBP4 might act in the pathophysiology of late-onset preeclampsia via increased insulin resistance in obese women.",preeclampsia
"Background: Impaired trophoblast invasion is suggested as the main cause of reduced placental perfusion, which results in fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia. Immunological response against the invading tissue has been given as the explanation. Preeclampsia frequently recurs during the next pregnancy. Doppler ultrasound can predict increased vascular impedance in the uteroplacental circulation. Whether signs of increased vascular resistance in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia are predictive of recurrence during the next pregnancy is unknown. Methods and material: Uterine artery Doppler was performed in 570 pregnant women with preeclampsia. Of these, 139 became pregnant again. The uterine artery Doppler results during the first pregnancy were related to symptoms of preeclampsia in the succeeding pregnancy. Results: Preeclampsia developed again in 43 of the 139 women. Pregnancies with signs of increased uterine artery vascular impedance during the first pregnancy were 3.4 times more likely to develop preeclampsia again (CI 1.58-7.6). Similar results for a small for gestational age newborn were 9.7 (CI 1.1-90). Conclusion: Increased uterine artery vascular impedance in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia increases the likelihood of recurrence and growth restriction during the next pregnancy. The Doppler information gathered during the first pregnancy might thus select cases for special surveillance and possibly prophylactic anti-platelet treatment in the next pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"Purpose: Pharmacotherapeutic options for the treatment of preeclampsia are reviewed. Summary: Risk factors for the development of preeclampsia include microvascular diseases, such as diabetes mellitus; vascular and connective tissue disorders; hypertension; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; and nephropathy. Several pathophysiological factors contribute to the development of the preeclamptic state, including vasospasm onset, coagulation system activation, increased inflammatory response, and ischemia. The specific agents used for the treatment of preeclampsia are dependent on a number of factors including symptom severity, maternal or fetal compromise, the progression to eclampsia, gestational period, and cervical status. The diagnosis of preeclampsia beyond the gestation period of 38 weeks requires delivery. The presence of maternal compromise or eclampsia at gestation greater than 20 weeks also necessitates delivery. In cases of chronic or mild hypertension, oral methyldopa may be administered on an outpatient basis. Intravenous hydralazine is a commonly administered arteriolar vasodilator that is effective for hypertensive emergencies associated with pregnancies. The most common adverse effect of hydralazine administration is unpredictable hypotension. Labetalol decreases heart rate and may be preferred because of a lack of reflex tachycardia, hypotension, or increased intracranial pressure. However, the drug of choice for the prevention and control of maternal seizures in patients with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia during the peripartum period is i.v. magnesium sulfate. Therapeutic serum magnesium levels cause cerebral vasodilation, thereby reversing the ischemia produced by cerebral vasospasm during an eclamptic episode. The results of one study indicated that women receiving magnesium sulfate therapy had a 58% lower risk of eclampsia than placebo. Conclusion: Magnesium sulfate remains the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of preeclampsia. Alternative antihypertensive agents may provide additional benefit in the management of hypertension for preeclamptic patients.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To determine if preeclampsia is an independent predictor of diastolic dysfunction and what factors among patients with preeclampsia are associated with diastolic dysfunction. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who delivered between 2008 and 2013 at a single institution who had a maternal echocardiogram during their pregnancy or within 5months of delivery. Patients with structural heart disease, ejection fraction less than 45%, pulmonary embolus, or age over 45years were excluded. Medical records were reviewed for medical and obstetric complications and echocardiogram findings. Demographic characteristics and rate of diastolic dysfunction were compared between patients with preeclampsia and without preeclampsia. Multivariate logistic regression was performed controlling for age, ethnicity, gestational age at delivery, diabetes, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), antihypertensive use and magnesium sulfate administration. Results: Sixty-six patients were identified, of which 39 (59%) had preeclampsia. Past history of preeclampsia, IUGR in the current pregnancy, antihypertensive use and magnesium sulfate use were higher in the preeclampsia group. Fifteen patients (39%) in the preeclampsia group were African-American compared to 2 (3%) in the control group (p<0.01). Seventeen (44%) of the patients with preeclampsia were found to have diastolic dysfunction compared to 3 (11%) controls (OR=6.18, 95% CI 1.59,24.02; p=0.006). Logistic regression analysis did not reveal other independent predictors of diastolic dysfunction. In the patients with preeclampsia, history of preeclampsia with severe features and IUGR were not associated with diastolic dysfunction. Conclusions: Our study supports previous findings that preeclampsia is associated with diastolic dysfunction.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific disorder that can be life threatening for both mother and baby. It is characterized by a new onset hypertension during the second half of pregnancy and affects ~300,000 women in the United States every year. There is no cure for PE, and the only effective treatment is delivery of the placenta and the fetus, which is often preterm. PE is believed to be a severe manifestation of placental dysfunction due to early angiogenic imbalances and inflammatory disturbances; however, the cause of this is unknown. The once thought ""sterile"" placenta now has been proposed to have a unique microbiome of its own. Under ideal conditions, the microbiome represents a balanced bacterial community that is important to the maintenance of a healthy environment. Dysbiosis of these communities may lead to inflammation that potentially contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and PE. Thus far, the female reproductive tract microbiome has been found to be influenced by periodontal disease, cardiometabolic complications, and maternal obesity, all of which have been identified as contributors to PE. This review will look at the maternal reproductive tract microbiome, evidence for and against, and its role in pregnancy and PE-related events as well as data from relevant mouse models that could be useful for further investigating the influence of the reproductive tract microbiome on the pathogenesis of PE.",preeclampsia
"Background: Severe early onset preeclampsia might be reversed by correction of an underlying pathophysiologic condition. Case: A 22-year-old nullipara with a history of antivesicoureteral reflux surgery in childhood presented at 23 weeks' gestation with severe headaches, hypertension, proteinuria, edema, and acute renal failure. Severe preeclampsia was diagnosed, and bilateral distal ureteral obstruction was documented by cystoscopy, fluoroscopy, and retrograde pyelography. Bilateral ureteral stent placement completely resolved the preeclampsia and prolonged pregnancy until term. Conclusion: Pregnant women with a history of antireflux surgery in childhood might be at risk for acute renal failure and severe preeclampsia caused by bilateral ureteral obstruction. Ureteral stent placement might reverse obstruction, renal failure, and preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia (PE) is an enigmatic syndrome, still with unknown aetiology and multi-factorial pathogenesis. Our understanding of the role of the immune system in PE development has undergone a transformation over the years. From a model based on the alterations in cell-mediated immunity, research moved on to a vision centred on the alteration of the humoural immunity and on the systemic involvement of the inflammatory system. The first hypothesis was classically derived from the evidence that an adequate maternal immunological response is necessary in pregnancy to allow the survival of the foetus. An abnormal response of the maternal immune system against the placenta may be the first pathogenetic step of PE, followed by a systemic inflammatory reaction. Currently available treatments for PE are mainly preventative with aspirin. Treatment aims to modulate inflammation and the immune system before their changes become established.",preeclampsia
"Ergothioneine (ERG), is a water-soluble amino acid that is derived entirely from dietary sources. It has received much attention as a therapeutic agent due to its anti-oxidant properties, and there are claims of preferential accumulation within high oxidative stress organs. Pre-eclampsia, a condition accompanied by increased oxidative stress, is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. Despite intense research efforts, its aetiologies remain somewhat unclear and there are still no effective treatment options. Clinical trials of the anti-oxidants vitamin C and vitamin E have proven largely ineffective with little improvement in clinical outcome or even a negative response. This could be explained in part by their inability to permeate the plasma and mitochondrial membranes and scavenge mitochondria-derived superoxide species, and for the former by the fact that it is actually a pro-oxidant in the presence of unliganded iron. ERG accumulates within tissues through the action of a specific organic cation transporter, SLC22A4 (previously referred to as OCTN1), which is possibly also expressed in mammalian mitochondria. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in a variety of vascular diseases including pre-eclampsia. This review discusses the use of ERG as a possibly mitochondrial-targeted anti-oxidant, focusing on its physical properties, potential mechanisms of action, safety profile and administration in relation to pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Previous studies have suggested that altered miRNA expression in the placenta is associated with preeclampsia. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of miR-424 in placental samples of severe preeclampsia (sPE) and uncomplicated pregnancy patients. miRNA was isolated from placentas obtained from 30 sPE patients and 30 healthy women. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the expression of miR-424. The prediction of target genes of miR-424 was performed using miRGen database. The function of these target genes was analyzed further by DAVID and Gorilla software. The expression of miR-424 was significantly lower in patients with sPE than in healthy controls. Changed expression of miR-424 in the case of pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders might affect the Wnt signaling pathway. These factors have a strong correlation with the development of PE. Expression of miR-424 in placenta was lower in patients with sPE, suggesting its role in the pathology of sPE.",preeclampsia
A prospective evaluation of the haemostatic mechanism was undertaken in 15 normal primigravidas and in 12 primigravidas with mild to moderately severe pre-eclampsia in order to further examine the possibility that disseminated intravascular coagulation may occur in this clinical syndrome. The only coagulation abnormality demonstrated was a prolongation of bleeding time. The data do not support the suggestion that significant disseminated intravascular coagulation is associated with pre-eclampsia. The addition of the heparinoid drug sodium pentosan polysulphate to the therapeutic regimen resulted in a significant fall in platelet factor 3 availability and in decreased aggregation against ADP but conferred no objective clinical improvement. We conclude that the drug has no place in the management of established pre-eclampsia.,preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder after the 20(th) week of gestation, that is usually associated with raised blood pressure, proteinuria, and pathologic edema. Eclampsia is defined as the occurrence of conculsions in association with the syndrome of preeclampsia. In Europe and other developed countries eclampsia complicates approximately 1 in 2,000 deliveries, while in developing countries estimates vary between 1 in 100 to 1 in 1,700. 44% of seizures occur postnatally, the remainder being antepartum (38%) or intrapartum (18%). Although rare, eclampsia probably accounts for 50,000 maternal deaths a year world-wide. In this review article we discussed conditions, which are associated with a higher incidence of preeclampsia, pathophysiology, findings at physical examination, principles of treatment (blood pressure control, anticonvulsant therapy, and fluid management), post-partum management, complications, maternal morbidity and mortality, as well as prevention.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Regardless of susceptibility or predisposing conditions and risk factors, the degree of increase in abdominal pressure is directly related to the severity of preeclampsia, particularly in women with hydatidiform mole. When increased abdominal pressure is normalized by delivery, preeclampsia is cured. Recent genetic studies highlighted two leading risk factors for preeclampsia: chronic renal disease and T235 homozygosity for the AGT gene. Thus, while there is increased abdominal pressure in pregnancy, an imbalanced renin angiotensin system and renal injuries lead to a vicious cycle of increasing abdominal pressure and further renal injuries. A hypothesis for the potential participation of pressure in preeclampsia is described and the amelioration of preeclampsia through postural intervention and the possible therapeutic effect of angiotensin is suggested.",preeclampsia
"A total of 58 women with severe preeclampsia between 28-33 weeks of gestation were studied during the period from 1 October 1996 to 1 October 1997. Twenty-four women (42%) developed maternal or fetal indications necessitating early delivery within 48 hours, meanwhile the other 34 patients (58%) received expectant management. The average pregnancy prolongation period in the conservative management group was 6.4 days (range 3 to 18). The primary indications for delivery in this group were maternal indications 16 (47%), fetal compromise 13 (39%), 34 weeks of gestation 3 (8%), abruption placentae 1 (3%) and preterm labor 1 (3%). The mean birth weight and Apgar score at 5 minutes were 1520 +/- 310 g and 8, respectively. Expectant management was not associated with fetal death or maternal complications. The only neonatal death was related with sepsis and prematurity. The women in the early delivery group totaled two stillbirths and three neonatal deaths.",preeclampsia
"Background: Nephrotic syndrome occurring for the first time in pregnancy is rare. We report pre-eclampsia presenting with nephrotic syndrome. Method: A case report utilizing the case record and review of relevant literature. Results: A 26-year-old multi-gravida who presented with nephrotic syndrome for the first time in pregnancy. Proteinuria resolved spontaneously after delivery. Conclusion: This report highlights the need for increased awareness of this rare presentation of pre-eclampsia, especially in the tropics where a large majority of women presenting for delivery are unbooked.",preeclampsia
"Objective: The aim of this study was to correlate bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) with the clinical course of preeclampsia with edema. Design: 440 pregnant women with apparently normal, single pregnancy participated in this longitudinal study. Anthropometric measurements and BIA were performed during pregnancy and postpartum period. Results: All of the measurements were completed in 333 of the women; 279 of the women had a normal pregnancy (control group). The remaining 54 women developed edema during the third trimester of pregnancy. Of these, 40 women had only edema, and 14 women had edema followed by hypertension and/or proteinuria (preeclampsia group). The BIA index (the height squared divided by resistance) in the control group increased significantly towards late pregnancy, compared to that in early pregnancy. The indexes in the edema group were significantly higher during the third trimester compared to those of the control group at the same gestational week. The index in the preeclampsia group was higher relative to that in the control group. Moreover, a substantial increase in the index preceded the development of edema in the cases in which pregnancy was terminated due to deterioration of preeclampsia. Conclusions: Our results show that BIA is a useful method for monitoring longitudinal changes in total body water in pregnant women, and that BIA may be a powerful predictor of deterioration of preeclampsia preceded by edema.",preeclampsia
"The purpose of this study was to summarize the new published data on the Doppler flowmetry in preeclampsia. Methods: We summarize the new published data on the Doppler flowmetry in uteroplacental, fetoplacental and fetal circulation in preeclampsia. The present review summarized the results of clinical research on the Doppler flowmetry in the screening of risk of preclampsia, in the diagnosis of preclampsia and in the fetal risk in preclampsia (Ref. 19).

"Objective: A precondition for the rational use of obstetric databases in biomedical research is detailed knowledge on how data are being generated. We identified the diagnostic procedures and criteria for pre-eclampsia (PE) and assessed the level of obstetric training of the personnel responsible for the records submitted to the patient registry at the Danish National Board of Health. Study design: A structured questionnaire, including three case stories, was sent to the chief consultant of the department. Results: Thirty-three out of the 34 Danish departments (97%) returned the questionnaire. Reporters of pregnancy diagnoses to the National Patient Registry differed widely in training. For complicated pregnancies, departments ranged from having only specialists reporting all cases to secretaries reporting up to 50%. Cut off limits of blood pressure (BP) and protein loss used to diagnose pre-eclampsia showed large differences across departments. The diagnoses given to three case stories showed little correlation to the criteria the departments reported using. Conclusion: Even in a small country like Denmark with 34 obstetrical departments, there was little consensus on the diagnostic criteria for pre-eclampsia. The findings emphasize the need for standardizing diagnostic criteria and reporting practice and may have implications on how to interpret data regarding pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"The internist has a relevant role in the medical assessment which is mandatory after every case of pre-eclampsia. This postnatal visit has to be performed to assert there is no underlying disorder such as chronic arterial hypertension or nephropathy, autoimmune disease or thrombophilia. This visit is also needed to provide information to the woman about what occurred during the pregnancy as well as to consider which would have to be done in case of a subsequent pregnancy. Long-term outcome had also to be taken into account considering risks for cardiac, arterial, renal and metabolic diseases. This visit is of outmost importance after very early-onset pre-eclampsia, and especially if it has already occurred. The postnatal visit after pre-eclampsia represents a very demonstrative example of the role that the internist can afford to the obstetrician in the management of medical disorders occurring during pregnancy and needing a specific expertise as well as a long-term follow-up.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To determine in multivariate analysis the clinical, social, and demographic factors for preeclampsia. Study design: A case-control study was designed. Three hundred patients were included, divided in two groups. 150 cases with criteria diagnosis for preeclampsia. 150 patients with normal pregnancy and deliveries. The main variables analyzed were age, schooling, marital status, employment, socioeconomic status, smoking and alcohol consumption, body mass index, familiar history of preeclampsia, history of preeclampsia in previous pregnancy, parity and type of pregnancy (single or multiple). Statistical analysis: For comparison of cases and controls on categorical variables, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that history of preeclampsia in previous pregnancy has OR 23.7, 95% p < 0.001, familiar history of preeclampsia OR 1.62, p < 0.08, high body mass has OR 1.60. Conclusions: The knowledge of the most important risk factors in our population could be useful for the clinical to pre-detect the patient who will develop preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To assess the impact of proteinuria on pregnancy outcomes among women with pre-eclampsia. Methods: The present retrospective cohort study included patients with pre-eclampsia who delivered at a referral maternity hospital in Brazil between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013. Patients were stratified into three groups based on 24-hour urinary protein excretion during pregnancy: mild (0.3-<2.0 g), severe (2.0-<5.0 g), and massive (≥5.0 g). Results: There were 293 patients included in the study; 88, 129, and 76 had mild, severe, and massive proteinuria, respectively. Chronic hypertension was the most frequent pre-existing condition among all women (86 [29.4%]). The mean pregnancy duration at the onset of maternal pre-eclampsia was longest in the mild group compared and decreased with increasing proteinuria severity (P<0.001). Preterm delivery was recorded among 205 of 293 (70.0%) neonates; there were 66 (22.5%) neonates that were preterm and in the massive proteinuria group. The incidence of severe pre-eclampsia was lowest in the mild proteinuria group (P=0.002) and tended to occur at 34 weeks. Cesarean delivery rates exceeded 80.0% in all groups. Most patients assessed at 40-60 days postpartum remained proteinuric (40/61[66%]). Conclusions: Quantifying the severity of proteinuria could identify a subgroup of women with pre-eclampsia at increased risk of adverse outcomes.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Gestational hypertension is a pregnancy complication that serious damages the maternal and child health. Early onset severe preeclampsia accounts for about 0.9% of the gestational hypertension disease. Conservative treatment is proposed in recent years to early onset severe preeclampsia through delay delivery. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore the pathogenesis of severe preeclampsia. Soluble endoglin (sEng) has been identified as a central factor to induce endothelium dysfunction of preeclampsia, while its specific mechanism is unclear. Materials and methods: Matrix metallopeptidase 14 (MMP-14) and endoglin expressions and tissue localization in the placenta of preeclampsia and premature were detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Endoglin level, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), and urinary protein/creatinine ratio were analyzed for correlation to investigate their relationship and the influence of endoglin on eclampsia severity. MMP specific or broad spectrum inhibitor combining MMP-14 siRNA were used in JAR cell line BeWo to explore the regulatory role of MMP-14 on endoglin. Results: MMP-14, endoglin, and sEng expression levels significantly increased in the placenta of severe preeclampsia patients. MMP-14 and endoglin exhibited expression co-localization. Endoglin expression was positively correlated with the severity of eclampsia. MMP-14 directly mediated the release of sEng. Conclusions: MMP-14 aggravated the onset of severe preeclampsia by mediating sEng release. MMP-14 was proposed as the effective target for the treatment of severe preeclampsia. Blocking the interaction between MMP-14 and endothelial protein may be an important treatment method.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To examine whether plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy can predict preeclampsia in the second half of pregnancy. Methods: The study population included 150,10 registered births. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to describe the relationship between different values of AST and ALT during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy in the prediction of preeclampsia. Results: Using ROC curve analyses, elevated ALT levels were significantly associated with both mild preeclampsia (p < 0.001) and severe preeclampsia (p = 0.032). However, an ALT level of 50 IU/L had a sensitivity of only 3.3% (despite a specificity of 97%) in the prediction of severe preeclampsia. While no significant association was noted between AST levels and mild preeclampsia (p = 0.669), elevated levels of AST during this period were significantly associated with severe preeclampsia (p = 0.027). However, AST of 50I U/L had a sensitivity of only 2.0% (despite a specificity of 98%) in the prediction of severe preeclampsia. Conclusions: Higher levels of the liver enzymes AST and ALT during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy are associated with higher risk for the development of severe preeclampsia in the second half of the pregnancy. Nevertheless, there is no clinical cutoff value that can be practically used for the prediction of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia

"Objective: Infants of women with preeclampsia are considered at high risk of fetal growth retardation. The purpose of our study was to determine whether the risk differed by parity. Study design: We compared the outcomes of 133 case patients with preeclampsia (101 nulliparous women and 32 multiparous women) and 132 normotensive control patients (52 nulliparous women and 80 multiparous women) who delivered at Northern California Kaiser Permanente hospitals between 1984 and 1985. Results: Women with preeclampsia were more likely than control patients to deliver a small-for-gestational-age infant (adjusted odds ratio 7.0, 95% confidence interval 2.8 to 18.1). After we controlled for smoking status, age, Quetelet index, and race, multiparous women with preeclampsia were at greater risk of having a small-for-gestational-age infant (adjusted odds ratio 29.4, 95% confidence interval 5.2 to 167.5) than were nulliparous women (adjusted odds ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 14.1) when compared with normotensive control patients of similar parity. Although multiparous women with preeclampsia had higher mean arterial pressures and somewhat earlier onsets of elevated mean arterial pressure than nulliparous women with preeclampsia, neither of these variables predicted whether the infants would be small for gestational age. Conclusion: Multiparous women with preeclampsia are at higher risk of having an infant with fetal growth retardation than are nulliparous women with preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To determine risk factors of superimposed preeclampsia in women with essential chronic hypertension receiving antihypertensive therapy prior to conception. Methods: A retrospective study of 211 patients that analyzed risk factors of superimposed preeclampsia at first prenatal visit. Variables with a p<.1 at univariate analysis were included in a logistic regression analysis. P<.05 was considered as significant. Results: Superimposed preeclampsia occurred in 49 (23.2%) women. In logistic regression analysis, previous preeclampsia [OR: 4.05 (1.61-10.16)], and mean arterial blood pressure of 95 mmHg or higher [OR: 4.60 (1.94-10.93)] were associated with increased risk of superimposed preeclampsia. When both variables were present, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and likelihood ratio for superimposed preeclampsia were 43%, 94%, 70%, 85%, and 7.71 (95% CI: 3.20-18.57), respectively. Conclusion: In essential chronic hypertensive women, previous preeclampsia and mean arterial blood pressure of 95 mmHg or higher are associated with increased risks of superimposed preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"At the start of the last decade, we provided evidence that levels of the peptide neurokinin B were highly elevated in pre-eclampsia. We hypothesized that elevated levels of neurokinin B may be an indicator of pre-eclampsia and that treatment with certain neurokinin receptor antagonists may be useful in alleviating the symptoms. At the time of the original hypothesis many questions remained outstanding. These included - Does neurokinin B have any diagnostic value in the detection and diagnosis of pre-eclampsia? - What is the cause of the elevated levels of neurokinin B during pre-eclampsia? - What is the physiological significance of neurokinin B in the placenta? This review discusses the answers to these questions taking into account the subsequent developments of the past ten years and analyzing the plethora of discoveries that have arisen from those initial observations.",preeclampsia
"Microarray studies generating lists of genes with altered expression in placentas from pregnancies complicated with pre-eclampsia (PE) have so far been published in several different studies. Working under the assumption that altered gene expression in PE may be the result of altered expression of regulatory transcription factors (TFs), we looked for over-represented TF-binding sites (TFBSs)-which indicate the involvement of TFs in gene regulatory networks-in lists of genes (n = 143) compiled in these studies. We compared the prevalence of TFBSs in the promoter regions of 68 genes with the background prevalence of TFBSs in promoters of the human genome. The prevalence of the E47, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) and NFKB-p50 TFBSs was higher (P < 0.005) in the promoter sequences of the PE gene lists than in the background model. Each of these TFBSs could be implicated in the development of PE. The E47 protein is an E-protein or basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TF. Data support the role of bHLHs in the differentiation of placental tissue. SREBP-1, a lipid-sensing sterol regulatory element-binding protein, is a critical regulator of fatty acid homeostasis in the placenta. The target genes of NFKB-p50 determine inflammatory response, and aberrant cytokine homeostasis is a further sign of PE. These TFs may provide an insight into the pathogenesis of the disease.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To explore the clinical features and prognosis of early-onset preeclampsia. Methods: A total of 115 cases of early-onset preeclampsia were recruited from January 1999 to December 2004 and the data analyzed in terms of the incidence, manifestation, maternal and fetal complications. Result: The early-onset preeclampsia accounted for 13.4% of all preeclampsia diagnosed. The perinatal mortality was 13.3% in early-onset preeclampsia. Dysfunction and hepatic dysfunction were the main maternal complications. The gestational ages at admission and at delivery were significantly correlated with perinatal prognosis (P<0.001). Most cases received regular treatment had good prognosis. Conclusion: Early-onset preeclampsia is a severe type of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia (PE) is one of the major causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In recent years, a growing body of literatures suggests that infections by bacteria, viruses, and parasites and their related inflammations play an important role in the pathogenesis of PE. Methods: We searched PubMed, Google scholar, and Cochrane databases using the following search words: ""infection and preeclampsia,"" ""bacterial infection and preeclampsia,"" ""viral infection and preeclampsia"" and ""parasitic infection and preeclampsia."" Results: The literature review revealed that many bacteria including Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumonia, and those are involved in periodontal disease or urinary tract infections (UTIs) and some viral agents such as Cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus type-2, human immunodeficiency virus, and some parasites especially Plasmodium spp. and Toxoplasma gondii can be effective in development of PE. Inflammation responses against infections has major role in the inducement of PE. The shift of immunological cytokine profile of Th2 toward Th1 and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-ɑ, IL-12, IFN-γ, etc.), increase of oxidative stress, increase of anti-angiogenic proteins, increase of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (sVEGFR1), and complement C5a are the main potential mechanisms related to infections and enhanced development of PE. Conclusion: Thus, early diagnosis and treatment of bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections could be an effective strategy to reduce the incidence of PE.",preeclampsia
"Problem: The purpose of this study is to clarify whether the disruption of immune regulation occurs in early pregnancy before the clinical manifestations of preeclampsia. Method of study: The serum concentrations of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were determined by using enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) in the first trimester of pregnancy in women who had preeclampsia develop after 28 weeks of pregnancy (preeclamptic group) and in women who completed pregnancy uneventfully (control group). Results: Serum concentrations of both IL-2 and TNF-alpha in the first trimester of the preeclamptic group were significantly higher than those of the control group. Conclusions: That the perturbation of feto-maternal immune regulation may precede the clinical manifestations of preeclampsia, which may be of relevance in the development of preeclampsia, is suggested.",preeclampsia
"Aim: The aim of the study was to assess association of thyroid hormone in preeclampsia and normal pregnancy. Material and method: This was a hospital based observational case control study. Total 100 women were included, out of them 50 normal pregnant women in control group and 50 pre-eclamptic women in case group were included. Result: In this study no significant difference was found in FT3 (p value 0.085) and FT4 (p value 0.065) in control and case group. TSH and Anti TPO levels in control and case group were statistically significant (p value <0.001 and <0.000). Conclusion: We observed that thyroid hormones (TSH and Anti TPO) have statistically significant relation in pre-eclamptic women.",preeclampsia
"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the leptin receptor (LEPR) polymorphism/serum leptin level and preeclampsia. The prevalence of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the LEPR gene exon 14 at -656 and the serum leptin concentrations in 97 preeclamptic pregnant mothers were compared to those of 110 healthy controls. The Lys656Asn genotype and Lys656Asn + Asn656Asn frequencies in the LEPR gene were significantly more prevalent in preeclampsia mothers than in controls (P < 0.05). The serum leptin levels of preeclampsia cases were significantly higher than those of controls. In addition, there were higher serum leptin levels in individuals with the GC + CC genotype both in the total cohort and in women with preeclampsia than in those with the GG genotype. Our findings suggest that the Lys656Asn polymorphism is a functional variant in the LEPR, which can affect the interaction of leptin and its receptor. Furthermore, high leptin level and the LEPR variant are risk factors for preeclampsia in Chinese women.",preeclampsia
"Background: PE is present in ∼2-8% of all pregnant women worldwide. Placental bed disorders at early and late PE have been not carried out yet. However, these studies help to explore details of the pathogenesis of PE, and to optimize the prognosis and obstetric management. Objective: To identify clinical and morphological differences between early- and late-onset PE based on a comprehensive observation of pregnant women with regard to morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of the placental bed. Materials and methods: One hundred fifty patients aged 18-43 years old delivered by cesarean section due to severe PE. The samples of placental bed tissue were studied by morphological and immunohistochemical methods. Results: The violation of invasion trophoblast, remodeling of spiral arteries were expressed in early onset PE; the degree of compensation of chronic hypoxia tissue in the area of the placental site was typical for late PE and was absent of an early onset PE. Conclusion: Our studies confirm the need for separation of early- and late-onset PE, being justified in terms of different pathogenetic mechanisms of formation, and therefore the possibility of therapeutic effects, duration of pregnancy prolongation, forecasting, search early diagnostic markers of the disease, and personalized approaches.",preeclampsia
"Problem: To determine if maternal immune maladaptation associated with pre-eclampsia is reflected in the rubella immunity status. Method of study: Incidence of pre-eclampsia was compared between rubella non-immune and immune gravidae carrying a singleton pregnancy beyond 24 weeks, taking into account maternal characteristics and reported risk factors for pre-eclampsia. Results: The 9870 (10.4%) rubella non-immune gravidae among the 95 024 in the cohort exhibited no difference in incidence of underlying medical disorders, but they were slightly but significantly older, shorter, heavier, and had more pre-eclampsia (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.47) despite having fewer nulliparas. Regression analysis confirmed an overall association between rubella non-immunity with pre-eclampsia (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.06-1.54), which was related to multiparas (aOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.05-1.91) and carrying a male fetus (aOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.06-1.78). Conclusion: The association between rubella non-immunity and pre-eclampsia reflects immune maladaptation in multiparas and toward a male fetus.",preeclampsia
"A Working Group on Research in Hypertension in Pregnancy was recently convened by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to determine the state of knowledge in this area and suggest appropriate directions for research. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, especially preeclampsia, are a leading cause of maternal death worldwide and even in developed countries increase perinatal mortality rates 5-fold. Much has been learned about preeclampsia, but gaps in the knowledge necessary to direct therapeutic strategies remain. Oxidative stress is a biologically plausible contributor to the disorder that may be amenable to intervention. Hypertension that antedates pregnancy (chronic hypertension) bears many similarities to hypertension in nonpregnant women, but the special setting of pregnancy demands information to guide evidence-based therapy. The recommendations of the Working Group are to attempt a clinical trial of antioxidant therapy to prevent preeclampsia that is be complemented by mechanistic research to increase understanding of the genetics and pathogenesis of the disorder. For chronic hypertension, clinical trials are recommended to direct choice of drugs, evaluate degree of control, and assess implications to the mother and fetus. Recommendations to increase participation in this research are also presented.",preeclampsia
"Background: The estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR1) seems to be a potential candidate in altering risk for preeclampsia due to important estrogenic biological effects. Despite its previously reported association with severe preeclampsia in combined genotype in one selected ethnic group, further studies in other populations are required. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship of the gene polymorphisms of the estrogen receptor alpha with preeclampsia in a southwest Chinese population. Methods: We genotyped two polymorphisms in the ESR1 gene (PvuII and XbaI) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in a Chinese population. Results: In the case-control study which included 204 preeclampsia case subjects and 236 normal control subjects, the frequencies of allele T for the PvuII site and allele G for the XbaI site in the patients (41.67% and 23.53%, respectively) were similar to those observed in controls (43.01% and 19.70%, respectively). Furthermore, the combined genotype analysis of ESR1 PvuII and XbaI polymorphisms showed no increased risk of either severe or total preeclampsia in our study populations. However, it showed that the CC homozygotes and CT heterozygotes in control pregnant women had higher systolic blood pressure levels than TT homozygotes for the PvuII site after adjustment for age and body mass index (p<0.05). Conclusions: Our work does not provide evidence in favor of ESR1 PvuII and XbaI being associated with preeclampsia but with increased blood pressure levels in normal pregnant women, in a southwest Chinese population.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-related disease that affects 2 to 8% of pregnancy worldwide. It is now a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular and renal diseases. Preeclampsia is a well-recognized risk factor for future cardiovascular, renal and neurological disorders for the mother. It predetermines the risk profile of the future child's health. A long-term follow-up aimed on prevention and screening should be offered. Further studies are needed to determine the modality of that follow-up as well as the prevention strategies specific for that population. This article proposes a non-exhaustive review of the cardiovascular, renal and neurological consequences of the disease on the mother and child's health.",preeclampsia
"A 31-year-old woman with severe pre-eclampsia developed bilateral serous retinal detachment on the second day post partum. After a few days there was spontaneous resorption of the subretinal fluid and the visual acuity improved. Ophthalmic examination showed no signs of hypertensive retinopathy. Some changes of the retinal pigment epithelium thought to represent healed infarcts of the choriocapillaris remained. Spontaneous retinal detachment is an uncommon complication of (pre)eclampsia, occurring both ante partum and post partum. Retinal and choroidal vascular damage have been implicated in the pathogenesis. Fluorescein angiographic observations lend support to the hypothesis that retinal detachment is secondary to choroidal vascular damage. The management of retinal detachment as a complication in obstetrics is conservative and the prognosis is good. Retinal detachment in (pre)eclampsia may be an indication for termination of pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"Background: Placental hypoxia has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is activated by low oxygen tension and is a key regulator of genes involved in the cellular responses to hypoxia. Aim: We determined whether maternal blood c.1722C>T (Pro582Ser) and c.1790G>A (Ala588Thr) polymorphisms in exon 12 of the HIF-1α gene are associated with pre-eclampsia. Subjects and methods: Subjects included 163 pre-eclamptic patients (48 mild and 115 severe preeclampsia) and 194 healthy pregnant women. Polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR and direct DNA sequencing. Results: There were no significant differences in genotype or allele frequencies of the c.1772C>T and c.1790G>A polymorphisms of the HIF-1α gene among the study groups. Moreover, subgroup analysis according to pre-eclampsia severity revealed no significant differences in genotype or allele frequencies of the HIF-1α c.1772C>T and c.1790G>A polymorphism in mild pre-eclamptic compared to severe pre-eclamptic group. In addition, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of 3 haplotypes (C-G,-G, T-G, and C-A) between the control and pre-eclamptic groups. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the HIF-1α gene polymorphisms are not associated with the development of pre-eclampsia in the studied Korean women population.",preeclampsia
"Early-onset preeclampsia has been linked to poor placentation and fetal growth restriction, whereas late-onset preeclampsia was suggested to result from maternal factors. We have proposed an alternative model, suggesting that both early- and late-onset preeclampsia result from placental syncytiotrophoblast stress. This stress represents a common endpoint of several Stage 1 processes, promoting the clinical stage 2 of preeclampsia (new-onset hypertension and proteinuria or other signs of end-organ dysfunction), but the causes and timing of placental malperfusion differ. We have suggested that late-onset preeclampsia, without evidence of poor spiral artery remodelling, may be secondary to intraplacental (intervillous) malperfusion due to mechanical restrictions. As the growing placenta reaches its size limit, malperfusion and hypoxia occurs. This latter pathway reflects what is observed in postmature or multiple pregnancies. Our revised two-stage model accommodates most risk factors for preeclampsia including primiparity, chronic pre-pregnancy disease (e.g. obesity, diabetic-, chronic hypertensive-, and some autoimmune diseases), and pregnancy risk factors (e.g. multiple or molar pregnancies, gestational diabetes or hypertension, and low circulating Placental Growth Factor). These factors may increase the risk of progressing to the second stage of preeclampsia (both early- and late-onset) by affecting one of or both pathways leading to Stage 1, as well as potentially accelerating the steps towards Stage 2, including priming the maternal cardiovascular susceptibility to inflammatory factors shed by the placenta. This paper reviews previous preeclampsia findings and concepts, which fit with the revised two-stage model, and argues that ""maternal"" preeclampsia does not exist, as all preeclampsia requires a placenta.",preeclampsia
"Objective: We aimed to analyze the role of platelet count (PC), mean platelet volume (MPV), and ratio of PC to MPV (PC/MPV) in predicting and/or diagnosing atypical pre-eclampsia (PE). Study design: We performed a retrospective case-control analysis of these platelet parameters in healthy pregnant women with normal blood pressure (control) and the changes that occurred in patients with atypical PE and PE. Main outcome measures: We performed statistical analysis to evaluate the prognostic and predictive significance of PC, MPV, and PC/MPV and the combined effects of these parameters in the parturient population (N = 300) composed of 100 controls, 100 atypical PE cases, and 100 PE cases. Results: The PC, MPV, and PC/MPV in both atypical PE and PE were significantly different to that in the controls. After adjusting for confounding factors using the ordinal logistics regression model, we found that PC/MPV, N% and BMI were independent risk factors for PE and atypical PE(The odds ratio was 0.925, 1.028 and 1.071). The model's C-index is 0.684. Conclusion: We found that the PC, MPV, and PC/MPV may be changed in atypical PE patients who did not have significant PE symptoms. Our results indicated that it could be a diagnostic method to predict atypical PE during pregnancy. PC/MPV and the other platelet parameters can play a role in predicting the development of atypical PE, leading to better diagnosis and management of atypical PE.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To predict women at risk of preeclampsia in the second trimester by the assessment of maternal cardiac output (CO). Methods: Between October 2001 to November 2003, we carried out a cross-sectional, prospective, hospital-base study in Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. Cardiac output was measured in 102 normotensive women at gestational age 19-25 weeks by Doppler echocardiography. Patients with CO >7.4 L/min were considered high risk group (Group 1) and those with CO < or =7.4 L/min were in Group II. They were followed-up until delivery and the incidence of preeclampsia was determined in both groups. Results: Twenty percent (6/30) of patient in Group 1, and 1.4% of patients in group II developed preeclampsia (p < 0.003). A cut off point of 7.34% L/min was chosen for prediction of preeclampsia that showed 85.7% sensitivity, 74.2% specificity with a negative predictive value of 98% and positive predictive value of 20%. Conclusion: Cardiac out put is significantly elevated in preclinical state of preeclampsia. Echocardiography is a non-invasive method to evaluate the maternal homodynamic during the second trimester and can help to identify high-risk patient before the development of preeclampsia, thereby it may improve the outcome of pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To determine whether maternal serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a cytokine with anti-inflammatory activity, also involved in cardiovascular morbidity, differ between women with early preeclampsia (<34 weeks) and those with uncomplicated pregnancies. Study design: This nested case control study included 40 women carrying a single fetus with an uncomplicated pregnancy and 20 women with early preeclampsia (<34 weeks). Data were matched 1:2 for gestational age at the time of venipuncture (28-34 weeks of gestation), converted into multiples of the median and adjusted for maternal weight. The maternal serum TRAIL concentrations were determined using an enzyme immunoassay. Results: The TRAIL concentrations were lower in the patients with early preeclampsia when compared with those of the control group, being 29.64 ± 8.83 pg/dL and 43.8 ± 12.53 pg/dL (p-value < 0.001), respectively. The difference was also present after multiple of median conversion and maternal weight adjustment. The quoted multiple of median values were 1.00 ± 0.27 and 0.82 ± 0.23, respectively (p-value < 0.001). Conclusions: Serum TRAIL concentrations are significantly reduced in patients with early preeclampsia. This result is in line with the presence of an intravascular inflammation typical of preeclampsia. The lower levels of TRAIL detected in preeclampsia should be useful for a more proper selection of women with long-term cardiovascular risk later in life.",preeclampsia
"Background: preeclampsia constitutes one of the main causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. The aim was to identify the risk factors associated to the developmental of preeclampsia mild-moderate and severe, as well as the force of association of these factors in a hospital of second-level medical care. Methodology: study of cases and controls, a relation 1:1, in women withdrawn of the Service of Gynecology and Obstetrics during 2004 to 2007. Pregnant women with more than 20 weeks gestation were included. In the cases group we included patients with diagnosis of preeclampsia mild-moderate or severe (corroborated clinical and laboratory). In the controls group that had a normal childbirth without pathology during the pregnancy. Results: 42 cases and 42 controls. The average age was of 27 years. The associated risk factors were overweight, obesity, irregular prenatal control, short or long intergenesic period, history of caesarean or preeclampsia in previous pregnancies. Conclusions: the knowledge of the risk factors will allow the accomplishment of preventive measures and decrease the fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality due to preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Some thrombophilias and severe preeclampsia may increase the risk for preterm deliveries and fetal death due to placental insufficiency. Our objective was to evaluate clinical and laboratory data as predictors of preeclampsia in a population of mothers with 3rd trimester fetal losses or preterm deliveries. In a longitudinal retrospective study, 54 consecutive women (age range: 16 to 39 years) with normotensive pregnancies were compared to 79 consecutive women with preeclampsia (age range: 16 to 43 years). Weight accrual rate (WAR) was arbitrarily defined as weight gain from age 18 years to the beginning of pregnancy divided by elapsed years. Independent predictors of preeclampsia were past history of oligomenorrhea, WAR >0.8 kg/years, pre-pregnancy or 1st trimester triglyceridemia >150 mg/dL, and elevated acanthosis nigricans in the neck. In a multivariate logistic regression model, two or more predictors conferred an odds ratio of 15 (95%CI [5.9-37]; P < 0.001) to develop preeclampsia (85% specificity, 73% sensitivity, c-statistic of 81 ± 4%; P < 0.0001). Clinical markers related to insulin resistance and sedentary lifestyles are strong independent predictors of preeclampsia in mothers with 3rd trimester fetal losses or preterm deliveries due to placental insufficiency. Women at risk for preeclampsia in this particular population might benefit from measures focused on overcoming insulin resistance.",preeclampsia
"Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if women with preeclampsia are more likely to have a sister who also had preeclampsia. Study design: This was a population-based case-control study using data from Washington (WA) state birth certificates linked to hospital discharge records. Cases were women with gestational hypertension (n = 1611) or preeclampsia (n = 1071); controls (n = 8041) had normotensive pregnancies. All women delivered their first child between 1987 to 2002 and had a sister with a previous delivery in WA. Results: Women with preeclampsia were 2.3 times (95%CI 1.8-2.9) more likely to have a sister who had preeclampsia; those with gestational hypertension were 1.6 times (95%CI 1.3-2.0) more likely to have a sister with gestational hypertension. Similar results were obtained following stratification by age, race, smoking status, or body mass index. Conclusion: The greater likelihood of preeclampsia among sisters of women with a previous preeclamptic pregnancy is consistent with a pathophysiologic role for genetic and/or behavioral factors that cluster in families.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To elucidate the role of the L-arginine:nitric oxide pathway in pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. Participants: Pregnant women (nulliparous, age <25 years). Normotensive pregnancy (n=22) was defined when blood pressure remained at levels of <120/80 mmHg and there was no proteinuria. Women with pre-eclampsia (n=22) had blood pressure measurements of >140/90 mmHg and proteinuria of >300 mg/l. Nonpregnant normotensive women (n=22) were studied as controls. Study design: Blood samples were taken for measurements of ionised calcium, atrial natriuretic factor, cyclic guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (GMP),arginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine. Urine samples were collected for determination of cyclic GMP excretion. Cyclic GMP concentrations were also determined in 12 women with severe pre-eclampsia before and after treatment with hydralazine. Results: L-arginine, asymmetric dimethylarginine and atrial natriuretic factor were not different in any group. Cyclic GMP concentrations in plasma [0.94 (SD 0.23) nM] as well as in urine [50.1 (SD 15.7) microM] were increased significantly (P<0.05) in normal pregnancy compared to nonpregnant controls [plasma mean 0.46 (SD 0.12) nM and urine mean 18.4 (SD 10.3) microM], but not in the pre-eclampsia group [plasma mean 0.48 (SD 0.10) nM and urine mean 24.1 (SD 14.5) microM]. Concentrations of cyclic GMP in plasma and urine increased significantly (P<0.05) in women treated with hydralazine. Conclusions: The differences in cyclic GMP concentrations may reflect differences in nitric oxide production. Hydralazine increases cyclic GMP concentrations in severely pre-eclamptic women. This action could explain the antihypertensive effect of hydralazine.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, in spite of extensive research worldwide, still we lack an effective screening test for pre-eclampsia. The aim of the current study is to assess the importance of micro-albuminuria and uterine artery Doppler resistance index as a screening test for pre-eclampsia during antenatal period. The study is a prospective audit. The study population consisted of 160 antenatal mothers attending the outpatient department. Test for micro-albuminuria was done at 14 weeks, 18 weeks, 28 weeks and 34 weeks of gestation. Uterine artery Doppler resistance index (0.58 taken as cut-off) was recorded at 18 weeks of gestation. The subjects were followed up till delivery for development of pre-eclampsia. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (along with confidence interval and diagnostic odd's ratio) of the tests were calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of micro-albuminuria was recorded as 66.67%, 93.24%, 44.44% and 97.18% respectively. Those of uterine artery Doppler resistance index were 33.33%, 95.96%, 40% and 94.67% respectively. Diagnostic odd's ratio of micro-albuminuria and uterine artery Doppler resistance index were 27.600 and 11.833 respectively. Confidence interval and diagnostic odd's ratios show that uterine artery Doppler study is a better screening test amongst the two. Both the tests being non-invasive in nature and having high specificity and high negative predictive value can be utilised in community-based antenatal care for identifying women who need intensive vigilance.",preeclampsia
"Rationale: Syncytiotrophoblast microparticles (STBM) are shed into the maternal circulation in higher amounts in pre-eclampsia compared to normal pregnancy and are believed to be the stimulus for the systemic inflammatory response and endothelial cell damage which characterises the maternal syndrome. The excess shedding of STBM may be caused by hypoxia as a result of poor placentation, which is often a feature of pre-eclampsia. Similar placental pathology occurs in some cases of normotensive intrauterine growth restriction (nIUGR), but in the absence of maternal disease. Objective: To examine whether the shedding of STBM in nIUGR occurs to the same extent as in pre-eclampsia. Methods: A prospective case-control study in a tertiary referral centre of: 1) women with early-onset pre-eclampsia (EOPET < 34 week), 2) women with late-onset pre-eclampsia (LOPET > or = 34 week), 3) women with nIUGR), 4) matched normal pregnant women (NPC), and 5) non-pregnant women. An ELISA using the antitrophoblast antibody NDOG2 was used to measure STBM levels in peripheral venous plasma. Non-parametric analyses were conducted with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Results: STBM levels rise during normal pregnancy. EOPET was associated with increased STBM levels (EOPET (median): 41 ng/ml, n = 15) compared with matched normal pregnancy (16 ng/ml, n = 15; Wilcoxon p = 0.005). LOPET (50 ng/ml, n = 10) and nIUGR (18 ng/ml, n = 8) STBM levels did not differ from matched normal pregnancy (36 ng/ml, n = 15, and 36 ng/ml, n = 8, respectively). Background levels in non-pregnant plasma were 0.49 ng/ml, n = 10. Conclusions: Increased STBM levels were found in EOPET but not in nIUGR providing further evidence for their role in the pathogenesis of the maternal syndrome.",preeclampsia
"Purpose of review: Preeclampsia is a gestational kidney disease characterized by glomerular endothelial injury, leading to maternal hypertension and proteinuria. If not addressed promptly, there is significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. When severe, this disorder can cause hepatic and neurologic dysfunction. Understandably, this placental disease enters the focus of the obstetrician first; however, with progression, the nephrologist can also be enlisted. Typical complications include acute kidney injury, refractory hypertension, and acute pulmonary edema. This review summarizes recent literature on the pathogenesis of this condition and will highlight new diagnostic and therapeutic options for preeclampsia. Recent findings: Over the past decade, the role of soluble vascular factors in preeclampsia has shed light on the mechanism underlying this disease. During the last 2 years, several new therapeutics have been developed that target implicated circulating angiogenic factors, including soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, an endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor. Serum levels of angiogenic factors have been correlated with a constellation of hemodynamic and pathophysiologic changes. Thus, circulating levels of these factors may serve both diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Summary: Overall, our understanding of preeclampsia has developed significantly and the future holds promise for mechanism-based novel diagnostics and therapeutics.",preeclampsia
"Introduction: Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-induced disorder that complicates approximately 5-7% of pregnancies. It is the leading cause of maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Aim: To determine the role of serum neurokinin-B level in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. Methods: This was a case-control study. A total of 80 pregnant women in their third trimester of pregnancy were included in the study. They were divided into two groups (40 pre-eclamptic and 40 normotensive) according to the presence or absence of clinical parameters of pre-eclampsia. Serum level of neurokinin-B was measured with ELISA. Results: Maternal age, weight, BMI, pulse, systolic BP and diastolic BP were statistically higher in the pre-eclampsia group compared to the normotensive group (P < 0.0001). Moreover, statistically higher levels were observed for neurokinin-B in the normotensive group as compared to the pre-eclamptic group. The mean value of neurokinin-B was 83.50 ng/L in the pre-eclamptic group compared to 111.5 ng/L in the normotensive group (P = 0.006). Conclusion: Higher levels of serum neurokinin-B were observed in the normotensive pregnant females as compared to the pre-eclamptic females. Thus, apparently, it seems that serum neurokinin-B plays no role in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia, and further large multicentre prospective studies may be required to ascertain its role.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia (PE) affects 2-8% of pregnancies worldwide, thus representing an important cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity, up to death. Many studies have been designed to identify putative biomarkers for accurate and timely diagnosing PE, but only some of them were focused on specific and sensitive biomarkers for early prediction of this life-threatening condition. In particular, some prospective studies aimed to investigate the predictive role of circulating biomarkers before 20 weeks of gestation in the general pregnant population yielded conflicting results. This article is hence centered on results obtained in studies investigating the predictive performances of angiogenic, anti-angiogenic, inflammatory, endocrine, and epigenetic biomarkers. The available evidence suggests that angiogenic and anti-angiogenic molecules, in particular the sFlt1:PlGF ratio, may be considered the biomarkers with the best diagnostic performance in the second trimester. However, doubts remain about their use in clinical settings before the 20th gestational week. Even lower evidence is available for other biomarkers, due to the fact that some positive results have not been confirmed in ensuing investigations, whereas unresolved analytical issues still contribute to make their clinical reliability rather questionable. Differential expression of microRNAs seems also a promising evidence for early prediction of PE, but additional research and well-designed prospective studies are needed to identify and validate routine predictive tests. KEY MESSAGES Preeclampsia affects 2-8% of pregnant women worldwide, thus remaining one of the leading causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Several studies have investigated the predictive role of circulating biomarkers before 20th week of gestation with conflicting results. Additional research and well-designed prospective studies are needed to identify and validate predictive tests in clinical practice.",preeclampsia
Context: Nesfatin-1 is implicated to possess an anti-inflammatory effect. Objective: The aim of our study is to investigate whether abnormal serum levels of nesfatin-1 are associated with the presence and severity of preeclampsia. Methods: A total of 120 women with preeclampsia and 92 women with uncomplicated pregnancies were enrolled in this study. Results: Women with preeclampsia showed significantly reduced levels of serum nesfatin-1 levels than women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Serum nesfatin-1 levels were significantly decreased in women with severe preeclampsia compared with women with mild preeclampsia. Conclusion: Decreased serum nesfatin-1 levels are associated with the presence and severity of preeclampsia.,preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia (PE) is the leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. MicroRNAs are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. In current study, we performed a microarray assay to explore miRNA expression profile in the placenta, and found 11 upregulated and 7 downregulated miRNAs in preeclampsia. miR-363, plus other 5 member of miR-106a∼363 cluster was further examined and validated. These findings would facilitate further investigation of aberrant expression of miRNAs in the pathology of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Purpose of review: Significant and intricate immune adaptations are essential for the establishment and maintenance of normal pregnancy. Preeclampsia is a morbid, potentially life-threatening disease for both mother and neonate that occurs uniquely in pregnancy, at least in part, due to maternal immune maladaptation. We aim to review the literature that focuses on case reports, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies for disorders of the complement alternative pathway (CAP) as related to preeclampsia. Recent findings: There is evidence of complement dysregulation in preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome, similar to that observed in a few rare types of thrombotic microangiopathies. Complement dysregulation may be identified with functional laboratory testing as well as genetic testing. Increased utilization of a standardized diagnostic approach to establish whether persistent and/or severe cases of preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome are complement-mediated may lead to development of future treatment strategies, such as complement-targeted therapy.",preeclampsia
"This is the Executive Summary of updated guidelines developed by the Society of Obstetric Medicine of Australia and New Zealand for the management of hypertensive diseases of pregnancy. They address a number of challenging areas including the definition of severe hypertension, the use of automated blood pressure monitors, the definition of non-proteinuric pre-eclampsia and measuring proteinuria. Controversial management issues are addressed such as the treatment of severe hypertension and other significant manifestations of pre-eclampsia, the role of expectant management in pre-eclampsia remote from term, thromboprophylaxis, appropriate fluid therapy, the role of prophylactic magnesium sulfate and anaesthetic issues for women with pre-eclampsia. The guidelines stress the need for experienced team management for women with pre-eclampsia and mandatory hospital protocols for treatment of hypertension and eclampsia. New areas addressed in the guidelines include recommended protocols for maternal and fetal investigation of women with hypertension, preconception management for women at risk of pre-eclampsia, auditing outcomes in women with hypertensive diseases of pregnancy and long-term screening for women with previous pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To determine the expression profiles of circular RNAs (circRNAs) of women with severe pre-eclampsia (sPE group) versus normal pregnancies (normal control group). Materials and methods: RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was conducted to characterize differentially expressed circRNAs and mRNAs in the placental tissues of women with sPE versus normal pregnancies. circRNA functions were predicted by Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database analysis. The backsplicing junctions of circRNAs were validated with the use of divergent primers. Relative expression levels of cirRNAs were verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). A circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network was constructed to outline the regulatory network of the differentially expressed circRNAs. Results: A total of 49 differentially expressed circRNAs were found in the placental tissues of women with sPE. Several differentially expressed mRNAs were also observed in the sPE patients. KEGG analysis revealed that the most enriched pathway of the circRNAs was the MAPK signaling pathway, while the differentially expressed mRNAs were primary enriched in pathways in cancer. Among these circRNAs, hsa_circ_0001438, hsa_circ_0001326, and hsa_circ_32340 were upregulated in the sPE patients and the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network generated with these three circRNAs revealed a broad regulatory network that might be involved in the pathogenesis of sPE. Conclusion: circRNAs are differentially expressed in sPE. The upregulation of hsa_circ_0001438, hsa_circ_0001326, and hsa_circ_32340 has a potential role in the regulation of miRNA and mRNA expression. Changes to the expression profiles of the circRNAs might be linked to the pathogenesis of sPE and could function as biomarkers.",preeclampsia
"Autophagy, a mechanism of cell survival during times of stress, may be active in normal placental maintenance, cushioning the fetus from strain during fluctuations in nutrient availability. Moreover, in cases of placental insufficiency, often present in preeclampsia, autophagy may be defective. We used published microarray datasets to analyze differential expression of autophagy pathway genes. No statistically significant difference in autophagy associated gene expression was found in preeclamptic vs. normal placenta samples. Thus although preeclampsia displays many of the features suggestive of altered autophagy, impaired placental autophagy as a cause of preeclampsia is not supported by whole placental tissue differential expression profiling.",preeclampsia
"The purpose of the study was to determine the morphological changes of rat placenta in II, III week of pregnancy under modeled preeclampsia. Modeling of preeclampsia was performed in the rats, as follows: lumen of the abdominal aorta below the renal artery was narrowed by the silk tread on the third of its diameter (0.2 mm). The placenta tissue was studied by histological and immunohistochemical methods (AE1/AE3, CD133, Ki-67). The study has shown that in the experimental model of preeclampsia at the end of II, III week of pregnancy the number of glycogen cells in the placenta trophyspongium layer is reduced compared with the control. There was shown sharp dilatation of the blood sinuses and lacuna, sometimes along the events of stasis. The volume of nucleated erythrocytes in fetal capillaries of the labyrinth layer is reduced compared with the control, especially in IIIweek of pregnancy. In the preparations marked by the CD133 marker, unlike to the norm of III week of pregnancy, the visualization of positive endothelial cells is complicated. The study of the preparations marked by Ki-67 marker reveals that the proliferated activity in the hypoxic placenta tissue is sharply reduced. The exception is those blood tubes, to which umbilical blood vessels are finally formed. It can be concluded that due to hypoxia placenta proliferation of placental blood vessels is disturbed that contributes to the disorder of placental blood circulation, reduce its metabolism in complications of pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"In well-resourced settings, reduced circulating maternal free placental growth factor (PlGF) aids in either predicting or confirming the diagnosis of preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, preterm birth, and delivery within 14 days of testing when pre-eclampsia is suspected. This operational pilot implementation of maternal plasma PlGF in women with suspected preeclampsia was conducted in six antenatal clinics in Maputo, Mozambique (six control clinics for comparison). The primary outcome was transfer to higher levels of care, following the informative PlGF assay. Of antenatal visits, 133/31,993 (0.42%) and 20/33,841 (0.06%) resulted in pre-eclampsia-related transfers of care for women attending intervention and control clinics, respectively (p < .0001). The clinic-to-delivery for women with low PlGF (<100 pg/ml) interval was shorter, (vs normal PlGF (median 10 days [IQR 1-25] vs 36 [11-83], p < .0001)). Low PlGF was associated with younger maternal age, higher blood pressure, earlier delivery, more therapeutic interventions, preterm birth, lower birth weight, and perinatal loss. In addition, one-third of hypertensive women with PlGF < 50 pg/ml suffered a stillbirth. In urban Mozambican women with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of preeclampsia, low maternal plasma PlGF concentrations are associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially early delivery and stillbirth. Therefore, introducing PlGF into the clinical care of women with suspected preeclampsia was associated with increased transfers to higher levels of care; low PlGF (<100 pg/ml) was associated with increased maternal and perinatal risks. PlGF < 50 pg/ml is particularly associated with stillbirth in women with suspected preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: We sought to review the risks and benefits of expectant management of severe preeclampsia remote from term, and to provide recommendations for expectant management, maternal and fetal evaluation, treatment, and indications for delivery. Methods: Studies were identified through a search of the MEDLINE database for relevant peer-reviewed articles published in the English language from January 1980 through December 2010. Additionally, the Cochrane Library, guidelines by organizations, and studies identified through review of the above documents and review articles were utilized to identify relevant articles. Where reliable data were not available, opinions of respected authorities were used. Results and recommendations: Published randomized trials and observational studies regarding management of severe preeclampsia occurring <34 weeks of gestation suggest that expectant management of selected patients can improve neonatal outcomes but that delivery is often required for worsening maternal or fetal condition. Patients who are not candidates for expectant management include women with eclampsia, pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal insufficiency, abruptio placentae, abnormal fetal testing, HELLP syndrome, or persistent symptoms of severe preeclampsia. For women with severe preeclampsia before the limit of viability, expectant management has been associated with frequent maternal morbidity with minimal or no benefits to the newborn. Expectant management of a select group of women with severe preeclampsia occurring <34 weeks' gestation may improve newborn outcomes but requires careful in-hospital maternal and fetal surveillance.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia is often thought of as being a disease of first pregnancies. The incidence of preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies, after a previous normal pregnancy is lower. However, it has been reported that this beneficial effect of multiparity is lost with a change in paternity. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of change in paternity on the incidence of preeclampsia in Dutch multiparous pregnant women. Methods: 364 Multiparous patients with hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > or = 100 mmHg) were identified in the obstetric database of the Academic Hospital Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam for the period 1989-1996. The diagnosis in their obstetrical history (Preeclampsia, HELLP-syndrome, chronic hypertension) was defined in a pragmatic way in view of the retrospective nature of the study. The control group consisted of 281 multiparous women from a midwife clinic, with normotensive pregnancies in the same period. Patients and controls were asked, by telephone, if the index pregnancy was from the same partner as the previous pregnancy and what the sex of the newborns had been in each pregnancy. Fisher's Exact test was used for statistical analysis and P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The final study group consisted of 333 multiparous patients with hypertension. The control group consisted of 182 multiparous women without hypertension. The prevalence of new paternity was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) both for preeclamptic and HELLP patients in comparison with the controls, with an odds ratio of 8.6 (95%CI: 3.1-23.5) and 10.9 (95%CI: 3.7-32.3), respectively. Conclusion: This study confirms that change of partner raises the risk for preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies. Immune maladaptation on the fetal maternal interface could be an underlying mechanism. Multiparous women with a new partner should be approached as being primigravid women.",preeclampsia
"An outstanding issue is how to efficiently identify women at high risk of preeclampsia. This retrospective cohort study included 8672 pregnancies at a single centre in Toronto. We tested our simple method - presence vs. absence of≥1 major (pre-pregnancy BMI>30kg/m2, chronic hypertension, pre-pregnancy diabetes mellitus and assisted reproductive therapy) or≥2 minor (prior stillbirth, age>40years, nulliparity, multifetal pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, and SLE) risk factors for PE. The RR of PE was 8.4 (95% CI 5.3-13.2) and the model C-statistic 0.74 (95% CI 0.69-0.79). Further testing of this method elsewhere is warranted.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Previous studies have found recurrence risks of severe pre-eclampsia as high as 40%. Our objective was to determine both the recurrence risk of severe de novo pre-eclampsia and risk factors associated with it in a contemporaneous population. Study design: Population-based retrospective cohort study. Population: Women who had two or more singleton liveborn or stillborn hospital deliveries in Ontario, Canada between April 1994 and March 2002 and without a history of chronic hypertension. Methods: International Classification of Disease codes were used to identify patients in the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database. Main outcome measures: The absolute and adjusted risks of recurrent severe de novo pre-eclampsia were determined. Results: Between 1 April 1994 and 30 March 2002, there were 185 098 women with two or more singleton deliveries >20 weeks in the province of Ontario, Canada. There were 1954 women who had severe de novo pre-eclampsia in the index pregnancy, 133 of whom had recurrent severe pre-eclampsia, for a risk of recurrent severe pre-eclampsia of 6.8% (95% CI 5.7-7.9%). The risk of recurrent severe de novo pre-eclampsia was increased in women with pre-existing renal disease (adjusted OR 17.98, 95% CI 3.50-92.52) and those >35 years of age (adjusted OR 3.79, 95% CI 2.04-7.04, reference 20-25 years). Conclusions: The recurrence risk of severe de novo pre-eclampsia in our population-based cohort study (6.8%) is lower than previously published reports in selected populations.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a common complication of pregnancy with potentially devastating consequences to both the mother and the baby.It is the leading cause of maternal deaths in developing countries. In developed countries it is the major cause of iatrogenic premature delivery and contributes significantly to increasing health care cost associated with prematurity. There is currently no known treatment for preeclampsia; ultimate treatment involves delivery of the placenta. Although there are several risk factors (such as multiple gestation or chronic hypertension), most patients present with no obvious risk factors. The molecular pathogenesis of preeclampsia is just now being elucidated. It has been proposed that abnormal placentation and an imbalance in angiogenic factors lead to the clinical findings and complications seen in preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is characterized by high levels of circulating antiangiogenic factors such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and soluble endoglin, which induce maternal endothelial dysfunction. These soluble factors are altered not only at the time of clinical disease but also several weeks before the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Many methods of prediction and surveillance have been proposed to identify women who will develop preeclampsia, but studies have been inconclusive. With the recent discovery of the role of angiogenic factors in preeclampsia, novel methods of prediction and diagnosis are being developed to aid obstetricians and midwives in clinical practice. This article discusses the role of angiogenic factors in the pathogenesis, prediction, diagnosis, and possible treatment of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Reviewed literature regarding exercise effects on pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, analyzing basic science perspectives and clinical studies. Methods: Scientific databases were accessed by research strategy combining Medical Subject Headings terms. Studies published between 2000 and 2015, in English, Portuguese, and Spanish language, were considered. Results: Studies were classified into: recommendations for exercise on high-risk pregnancy; animal models for hypertension in pregnancy; exercise on hypertensive disorders in animal models and pregnant women. Conclusion: There are several animal models to mimic hypertensive disorders in pregnancy; however, clinical studies are still needed for exercise recommendation in pregnant women with hypertensive disorders.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disorder believed to result from widespread endothelial dysfunction. Endothelin and NO are two potent vasoactive agents of endothelial origin and, as such, are postulated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. If these agents are found to be important in preeclampsia, they will most likely exert their effects locally, rather than systemically. Future research on the autocrine and paracrine effects of endothelin and NO may yield important insights into the cause and pathogenesis of this enigmatic disease.",preeclampsia
"Background: Because of the importance of pre-eclampsia and proteinuria in pregnancy, a faster and simpler diagnostic method is needed. Aim: To compare random urine protein to creatinine ratio (p:c ratio) with 24-h urine protein excretion rate in pregnant women with a suspicion of pre-eclampsia. Methods: The study was conducted on 100 pregnant women with gestational ages of >or=20 weeks; 50 patients were suspected of having pre-eclampsia and 50 were healthy pregnant women. A random urine sample for p:c ratio determination and a 24-h urine sample for protein measurement were obtained. Results: All women suspected of having pre-eclampsia had significant proteinuria. The single-voided p:c ratio demonstrated a sensitivity of 94% with a specificity of 96% at the cut-off>or=0.2 mg/mg. There was strong correlation between the two methods in this group (r=0.70, P<0.001, R2=49%). Using the same cut-off in the pregnant women who were not thought to have pre-eclampsia, the sensitivity of the test (p:c ratio) was 29% and the specificity was 87%. Pearson's correlation coefficient was 26 (P<0.06). Negative predictive value and positive predictive value were 34 and 83%, respectively. Conclusion: There is a strong correlation between 24-h urine protein excretion and single-voided urine p:c ratio in women suspected of having pre-eclampsia. A single-voided p:c ratio of >or=0.2 mg/mg is highly predictive for significant proteinuria. However, this test was not found to be a reasonable alternative to 24-h urine collection; and it must be followed by 24-h urine collection in a clinically suspect patient with a p:c ratio of <0.2 mg/mg.",preeclampsia
"The cause of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy remains unknown. More than 100 clinical, biophysical and biochemical tests have been recommended to predict the development of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. The findings of numerous studies have been inconsistent. The purpose of this review is to assess the serum uric acid currently proposed for predicting the development of preeclampsia. Hyperuricaemia (> 6 mg/100 ml) correlates with the severity of the preeclamptic lesion, as well as the poor fetal outcome.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is an important syndrome complicating pregnancy. While the pathogenesis of preeclampsia is not entirely known, poor placental perfusion leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction is accepted as a major mechanism. It has been suggested that altered placental expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may cause shallow cytotrophoblastic invasion and incomplete remodeling of the spiral arteries. MMPs are also thought to link placental ischemia to the cardiovascular alterations of preeclampsia. In fact, MMPs may promote vasoconstriction and surface receptors cleavage affecting the vasculature. Therefore, the overall goal of this review article is to provide an overview of the pathophisiology of preeclampsia, more specifically regarding the role of MMPs in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and the potential of MMP inhibitors as therapeutic options.",preeclampsia
"Despite intense investigation, preeclampsia (PE) remains largely enigmatic. Relatively late onset of diagnostic signs and heterogeneous nature of the disease further contribute to poor understanding of its etiology and clinical management. There exist no concrete animal models that can provide mechanistic underpinnings for evaluating targeted therapeutic intervention. Poor cross-sectional findings with potential biochemical markers reported so far have proved counterintuitive and suggest a need for novel approaches to predict the early onset of disease. Because of the co-onset of local placental anomalies and systemic manifestation of symptoms, it is highly likely that serum from PE patients can provide a ""blueprint"" of causative factors. Proteomic and/or functional analysis of maternal serum are expected to predict the onset of disease ahead of manifestation of clinical symptoms. A serum-based predictive assay should overcome complexities resulting from the heterogeneous etiology of PE. This review attempts to address some of these issues and discuss the signature biochemical serum factors and propose new and better ways to predict PE.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia is one of the most common pregnancy-induced complications, and results in a large number of maternal deaths. How pregnancy incites or aggravates hypertension remains unresolved; despite decades of intensive research directed to hypertensive disorders, they remain among the most important unresolved problems in obstetrics. The incidence of preeclampsia is increased in multiple pregnancies, and several preeclampsia-related fetal risks may be particularly hazardous to the babies of multiple gestations. Methods: The records of 561 women with multiple pregnancies delivered consecutively at Mackay Memorial Hospital were reviewed retrospectively. Thirteen mild cases and 39 severe cases of preeclampsia in multiple pregnancies were compared with 52 control cases of multiple pregnancies without preeclampsia, but matched for maternal age and parity. The categories for comparison included parity, gestational age, time of onset of preeclampsia, route of delivery, mean birth weight, growth discordancy, maternal complications, neonatal morbidity and mortality. Results: The incidence of preeclampsia in our consecutive series of 561 multiple pregnancies was 9.3% compared with 1.8% in singleton pregnancies (p < 0.0001). In primiparas with multiple pregnancies, the incidence of preeclampsia was 12.2% compared with 6.2% (p < 0.05) in multiparas. Breech presentation was the most common indication for Cesarean section in all groups. The preeclamptic group had a significantly higher rate of Cesarean section compared with the control group (p < 0.006), with prolonged labor and fetal distress were the two main reasons for this difference. Severe preeclamptic patients had babies with significantly lower mean birth weights (p < 0.05), higher incidence of intrauterine growth retardation (p < 0.025) and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (p < 0.0008) compared with those of the control group. All seven cases with maternal complications were in the severe preeclamptic group. Conclusions: An unfavorable perinatal outcome was found to be associated with severe, but not with mild, preeclampsia in multiple pregnancies.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Pre-eclampsia, recurrent miscarriage and infertility may all partly be caused by unsuccessful placentation early in pregnancy. If so, one will expect these disorders to be associated in population studies. The aim of the present investigation was to estimate the risk of pre-eclampsia in women with recurrent miscarriage and infertility. Design: Cohort study. Setting: The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), a large population-based pregnancy cohort. Sample: The sample consisted of 20,846 singleton pregnancies to nulliparous women participating in the MoBa, 1999-2005. Methods: Information on miscarriage, infertility and potential confounders was self-reported in postal questionnaires, whereas the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia was retrieved from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Risk estimation and confounder control was performed with multiple logistic regression. Main outcome measures: Pre-eclampsia according to history of miscarriage and infertility. Results: An increased risk of pre-eclampsia, although not statistically significant, was found for women with recurrent miscarriages (adjusted OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.80-2.83). Women who had ever been treated for infertility also had increased risk (adjusted OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05-1.60). When these two risk factors were combined, the adjusted odds ratio for pre-eclampsia was 2.40 (95% CI 1.11-5.18). Conclusions: The study supports the hypothesis that infertility, recurrent miscarriage and pre-eclampsia share elements of the same aetiological factors.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Increased total body oxygen consumption requirements are usually met by increased oxygen delivery and increased oxygen extraction. In certain conditions (e.g., adult respiratory distress syndrome) the ability to increase oxygen extraction is lost, and any increase in oxygen consumption depends on increased oxygen delivery. The objective of this study was to investigate the oxygen delivery/oxygen consumption relationship in severe preeclampsia. Study design: Thirty-two patients with severe preeclampsia (blood pressure > 160/110 mm Hg; 3 to 4+ proteinuria) were monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter. Baseline oxygen consumption and delivery in a group without volume expansion or pharmacologic vasodilatation were compared with those in a group who had received a magnesium sulfate infusion. Results: Oxygen consumption, oxygen delivery, arterial-venous-oxygen difference, and the oxygen extraction ratio were low when compared to that for normal 32 to 38 week pregnancy. The oxygen extraction ratio, defined as the ratio of oxygen consumption to oxygen delivery, was abnormally low for pregnancy, especially considering the low oxygen delivery levels in these patients. Oxygen consumption was dependent on oxygen delivery over the entire range of values seen. Conclusions: Severe preeclampsia is associated with an abnormality of tissue oxygen extraction, as evidenced by a low and unresponsive oxygen extraction ratio. Oxygen consumption increases proportionately with increases in oxygen delivery without reaching an oxygen delivery-independent state. Even at high oxygen delivery levels the oxygen consumption in preeclamptic patients is still abnormally low for pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"HELLP syndrome continues to be a clinical entity of difficult diagnosis. Weinstein first defined it in 1982 giving the practicing obstetrician a sequence of useful initials (H = hemolysis; EL = elevated liver enzymes; LP = low platelets). Since then a lot has been written and it has become clear that the syndrome is a form of severe preeclampsia. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology does not include HELLP in the description of severe pre-eclampsia as such but does accept each of its components as being part of severe pre-eclampsia. The case presented deals with a 33 year old white female, admitted at 27 weeks gestation with nausea, epigastric pain resembling acute abdomen, nose bleeding and mild hypertension. The analysis revealed an abnormal liver profile with elevated GOT, GPT and LDH, heavy proteinuria (14.4 g/day), decreased platelet count (92000/mm3) and elevated total bilirubin. Pregnancy was terminated by cesarean section 24 hours after admission because the patient's condition was deteriorating. Obviously in pre-eclampsia/eclampsia there is a systematic injury to all tissues. Proof of this is the hypertension as a consequence of vascular spasm and proteinuria due to glomerular injury. In HELLP the sequence of events is probably altered; hepatic injury precedes vascular and renal injury of conventional preeclampsia. The syndrome results from many clinical and pathological symptoms derived from endothelial microvascular injury which determine a rapid platelet activation causing vascular spasm, platelet aggregation and further endothelial injury through a feedback mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",preeclampsia
"Today the only effective ""treatment"" for preeclampsia is to deliver at the optimal time for both maternal and foetal well-being. Studies reported that severe preeclampsia can benefit from the expectant management including mild preeclampsia between 34 and 37 weeks. However it is unclear whether mild preeclampsia before 34 weeks also benefits from the expectant management. Data on 274 women with mild preeclampsia before 37 weeks of gestation were retrospectively collected and analysed. Blood pressure and proteinuria at time of onset were not clinically associated with delivery time. For women who developed preeclampsia before 34 weeks, the median latency from onset to delivery or from onset to admission to hospital or from admission to hospital to delivery was 27 or 21 or 3 days, respectively. There were four women (2%) who delivered within 48 h after onset, 28 (14%) FGR and 14 (7%) stillbirths. The median birth-weight was 2240 g. For women who developed preeclampsia between 34 and 37 weeks, the median latency from onset to delivery or from onset to admission to hospital or from admission to hospital to delivery was 11 or 7 or 2 days, respectively. There were seven women (10%) who delivered within 48 h after onset and eight (12%) FGR. The median birth-weight was 2880 g. Our study demonstrates that mild preeclampsia before 37 weeks has benefits from expectant or outpatient management with a median prolongation of over 11 days dependent on the time of onset, but it increases the risk for stillbirths before 34 weeks.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To assess the clinical utility of knowledge of a family history of pre-eclampsia as a predictor for the development of pre-eclampsia in primigravid women. Methods: 368 primigravid women were prospectively recruited from the outpatients department of an obstetric teaching hospital. Details of any family history of pre-eclampsia were obtained from the women and their subsequent obstetric outcomes were observed. Results: Of 368 primigravid women, 34 (9.2%) developed pre-eclampsia. Eighteen (4.9%) women of the total group stated that they had a mother (12), sister (five) or both (one) who had had pre-eclampsia. Of these 18 women, five (27.8%) developed pre-eclampsia. Of the women who had no family history, 29 (8.3%) developed pre-eclampsia (relative risk, RR = 3.4; 95% CI, 1.5-7.6; P = 0.018). Four (22.2%) of the women with a positive family history developed severe pre-eclampsia compared to 18 (5.1%) with a negative family history (RR = 4.3; 95% CI, 1.6-11.5; P = 0.017). Conclusions: In a primigravida, a family history of pre-eclampsia is associated with a fourfold increased risk of severe pre-eclampsia. This clinical history identifies a group who warrant close clinical surveillance during pregnancy and who may be suitable for trials of prophylactic interventions.",preeclampsia
"Purpose: Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria during pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia remains a major cause of maternal death in low-income countries. Vitamin D has a very diverse biological role in cardiovascular diseases. This study will evaluate the association of vitamin D levels and relevance to pre-eclampsia. Methods: We conducted a case-control study of women recruited from the GenPE (Genetics and Pre-eclampsia) Colombian registry. This is a multicenter case-control study conducted in eight Colombian cities. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration was measured using liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry from 1013 women with pre-eclampsia and 1015 mothers without pre-eclampsia (controls). Results: Fifty-two percent of women with pre-eclampsia were vitamin D deficient. The 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly lower in the pre-eclampsia (mean 29.99 ng/mL; 95% CI: 29.40-30.58 ng/mL) group compared to controls (mean 33.7 ng/mL; 95% CI: 33.20-34.30 ng/mL). In the unadjusted model, maternal vitamin D deficiency, defined by maternal 25(OH)D concentration <30 ng/mL, was associated with an increased probability of suffering from pre-eclampsia (OR 2.10; 95% CI, 1.75-2.51). After adjusting for covariates, a similarly increased probability of having pre-eclampsia was observed (OR 2.18; 95% CI, 1.80-2.64) among women with vitamin D deficiency, relative to controls. Conclusion: Although the results suggest that low maternal concentrations of 25(OH)D increase pre-eclampsia risk, this evidence may not be indicative of a causal association. Future studies are needed to confirm a definite causal relationship between concentrations of vitamin D and the risk of pre-eclampsia, by means of powered clinical trials.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder unique to human pregnancy that can result in significant morbidity and mortality for mother and fetus. While the etiology of preeclampsia is unknown, the placenta in general and trophoblast in particular is a prerequisite for the disease. We overview normal development of the human placenta, describe the role of hypoxia and other insults in placental injury, and highlight how the dysregulation of villous trophoblast biology in the second half of pregnancy may incite the pathophysiology of preeclampsia in the mother.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia complicating 3-5 % of all pregnancies in the world. Its origin is abnormal placentation around 12th week pregnancy. It associates hypertension and proteinuria appeared after 20th week pregnancy. Many risk factors with various mechanism of action have been identified (primigravida, younger age, twin pregnancy...). The main consequence of placental ischemia is generalized endothelial dysfunction responsible for clinical symptoms and complications (eclampsia, placental abruption, HELLP syndrome). It's an important cause of maternal death and is associated with increased risk of neonatal mortality, particularly in developing country. There is no consensus with regard to management particularly utilisation of drugs and break indication of pregnancy. Low dose aspirin is the only efficient preventive strategy in high-risk subjects. The therapeutic aspects are discussed as many in the benefit and the modalities of the antihypertensive treatment, as the indications of pregnancy interuption. Prevention is an up coming way but for the moment, only acetylsalicylic acid has proven its efficacity among the high risk patients.",preeclampsia
"Recently, it has been described that human fertility is associated with the interleukin 10 (IL10) -2849 AA genotype. Pre-eclampsia is the most common pregnancy-specific complication. In the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia, IL10 may affect maternal intravascular inflammation as well as endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that pre-eclampsia is associated with genetic variation in the IL10 promoter region in a case-control study for pre-eclampsia. Women homozygous for the IL10 -2849A allele have a threefold reduced risk for pre-eclampsia compared to controls (odds ratio 0.29; 95% CI 0.10-0.83). No differences in genotype frequency were found for polymorphisms in the IL10 promoter region at positions -1082, -819 and -592. This suggests that there is a genetically determined mechanism which protects the mother against pre-eclampsia, as reflected in the lower frequency of the IL10 -2849AA genotype in pre-eclamptic women.",preeclampsia
"Objective: The objective of this study is to determine the rate of acute pancreatitis in preeclampsia/eclampsia patients and describe the clinical manifestations, treatment characteristics and outcome of five cases of severe preeclampsia concurrent with or complicated by acute pancreatitis. Methods: The clinical data of pregnant women with preexisting or gestational hypertension who sought medical care between January 2002 and December 2015 at the Pregnant Women Critical Care Unit of Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China were retrieved. The rate of acute pancreatitis in preeclampsia/eclampsia patients was calculated and patients with preeclampsia/eclampsia and acute pancreatitis were included for further analysis. Results: Totally 1703 pregnant women who received medical care at our institution during the review period were diagnosed with hypertension. Four hundred and seven (23.9%) of them had severe preeclampsia. Five (1.2%, 5/407) women with severe preeclampsia developed acute pancreatitis. Their median age was 32 (range 25-35) years and the median duration of gestation was 32 (range 28-40) weeks. Mild acute pancreatitis occurred in three cases, and moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis in one case each. Four patients underwent cesarean resection and one patient underwent vaginal delivery. Conservative therapy was undertaken. No patient received surgical intervention and cure was achieved in all patients. Conclusion: Acute pancreatitis may complicate severe preeclampsia/eclampsia or may be concurrent with severe preeclampsia/eclampsia, complicating and compromising the management of preeclampsia/eclampsia. Physicians should be alert for the presence of acute pancreatitis as prompt diagnosis and treatment, rapid termination of pregnancy and subsequent conservative management of pancreatitis could lead to a general favorable outcome.",preeclampsia

"Preeclampsia is a complex disorder which affects an estimated 5% of all pregnancies worldwide. It is diagnosed by hypertension in the presence of proteinuria after the 20th week of pregnancy and is a prominent cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. As delivery is currently the only known treatment, preeclampsia is also a leading cause of preterm delivery. Preeclampsia is associated with maternal vascular dysfunction, leading to serious cardiovascular risk both during and following pregnancy. Endothelial dysfunction, resulting in increased peripheral resistance, is an integral part of the maternal syndrome. While the cause of preeclampsia remains unknown, placental ischemia resulting from aberrant placentation is a fundamental characteristic of the disorder. Poor placentation is believed to stimulate the release of a number of factors including pro- and antiangiogenic factors and inflammatory activators into the maternal systemic circulation. These factors are critical mediators of vascular function and impact the endothelium in distinctive ways, including enhanced endothelial oxidative stress. The mechanisms of action and the consequences on the maternal vasculature will be discussed in this review.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To compare the prevalence of recurrent pre-eclampsia between women who have and do not have metabolic syndrome when non-pregnant. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Three tertiary referral hospitals in the Netherlands. Population: Formerly pre-eclamptic women. Methods: The presence or absence of metabolic syndrome was assessed in 480 women at least 6 months after their first pre-eclamptic pregnancy using World Health Organization criteria. We compared the prevalence of recurrent pre-eclampsia in the subsequent pregnancy, calculating odds ratios (OR), adjusted for confounders. Main outcome measure: Recurrence of pre-eclampsia in the subsequent pregnancy. Results: Subsequent pregnancy outcome data were available for 197 women. Forty women had metabolic syndrome after previous pregnancy (20%). The prevalence of recurrent pre-eclampsia was 18/40 (45%) in women with metabolic syndrome versus 27/157 (17%) in women without metabolic syndrome; OR 3.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.86-8.33, adjusted OR 3.77 (95% CI 1.61-8.81). The risk of recurrent pre-eclampsia increased with each extra component of the metabolic syndrome from 11.8% for absent components up to 43.9% for three or more (P for trend < 0.001). Conclusions: Interpregnancy metabolic syndrome predisposes to recurrent pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To identify clinical risk factors associated with development of delayed-onset postpartum preeclampsia, and to characterize management and subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease. Methods: This is a case-control study of women admitted to the hospital with delayed-onset postpartum preeclampsia (defined as a new diagnosis of preeclampsia presenting between 48 hours and 6 weeks postpartum) compared with women with full-term, uncomplicated pregnancies without a hypertensive diagnosis or diabetes. Included women delivered between January 2014 and June 2018 at a single tertiary care center. Women with an antenatal diagnosis of preeclampsia or chronic hypertension were excluded. Univariate analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with delayed-onset postpartum preeclampsia and to compare rates of hypertension and antihypertensive medication use, with follow-up beyond 3 months postpartum among a subset of women in the control group who were matched 2:1 with women in the case group. Multivariable logistic regression was performed and included covariates identified in a backward stepwise approach. Results: Compared with women in the control group (n=26,936), women with delayed-onset postpartum preeclampsia (n=121) were significantly more likely to be of non-Hispanic black race (31.4% vs 18.0%), obese (39.7% vs 20.1%), and deliver by cesarean (40.5% vs 25.8%), all P<.01. For women diagnosed with delayed-onset postpartum preeclampsia, the median postpartum day of presentation was 7.0 (interquartile range 5.0-9.0), with 93.4% presenting secondary to symptoms, which was most commonly a headache. A majority (73.6%) underwent imaging studies, and 49.6% received intravenous antihypertensive agents. A total of 86 (71.0%) women with delayed-onset postpartum preeclampsia and 169 (72.8%) women in the control group had longer term information available, with a median follow-up time of 1.5 years (interquartile range 0.8-2.8). Delayed-onset postpartum preeclampsia was associated with higher blood pressures at 3 months postpartum or later (median systolic 130 mm Hg vs 112 mm Hg and median diastolic 80 mm Hg vs 70 mm Hg, P<.001). Conclusion: Delayed-onset postpartum preeclampsia is associated with variable management strategies. There is substantial overlap between the clinical risk factors for delayed-onset postpartum preeclampsia and antepartum preeclampsia. Our findings suggest that delayed-onset postpartum preeclampsia is also associated with an increased risk of progression to chronic hypertension.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: Using an angiotensin sensitivity test we carried out a prospective study in an attempt to predict the possible onset of preeclampsia and to prevent it by calcium supplementation (elemental calcium 156 or 312 mg/day per os) and treatment with vitamin D3 (0.5 micrograms/3 day per os). Method: We used a study design in which 666 singleton pregnant women were managed with conventional antenatal care and 210 singleton pregnant women were managed with a protocol, together with conventional antenatal care. Result: Of the 666 women managed conventionally, 113 (16.9%) developed preeclampsia. However, the incidence of preeclampsia in the 210 women managed on the protocol was lower, at 10.9%. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that this protocol for the prediction and prevention of preeclampsia is useful for pregnant women at high risk of developing preeclampsia.",preeclampsia

"Pre-eclampsia is a significant health issue in pregnancy, complicating between 2-8% of pregnancies. L-arginine is an important mediator of vasodilation with a potential preventative role in pregnancy related hypertensive diseases. We aimed to systematically review randomised trials in the literature assessing the role of L-arginine in prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, PUBMED, and the Australian and International Clinical Trials Registry, to identify randomised trials involving pregnant women where L-arginine was administered for pre-eclampsia to improve maternal and infant health outcomes. We identified eight randomised trials, seven of which were included. The methodological quality was fair, with a combined sample size of 884 women. For women at risk of pre-eclampsia, L-arginine was associated with a reduction in pre-eclampsia (RR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.21-0.55), when compared with placebo and a reduction in risk of preterm birth (RR: 0.48 and 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.81). For women with established hypertensive disease, L-arginine was associated with a reduction in pre-eclampsia (RR: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.05-0.98). L-arginine may have a role in the prevention and/or treatment of pre-eclampsia. Further well-designed and adequately powered trials are warranted, both in women at risk of pre-eclampsia and in women with established disease.",preeclampsia
"The influence of pregnancy induced hypertension (pre-eclampsia) on visual, auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials has been studied. The research was carried out on three groups of women: 63 pregnant women with hypertension, 45 healthy pregnant women and 54 non-pregnant ones. Standard stimulation and recording technique of the evoked potentials was implemented. Comparing pregnant and non-pregnant women no statistically significant differences in the latencies, interlatencies and amplitudes of analyzed components of visual, auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials have been observed. In pre-eclamptic women the latency of the component P100 of the visual potentials, the latency N20 and the interlatency N13-N20 (CCT--central conduction time) of the somatosensory evoked potentials were prolonged. No statistically relevant differences concerning the latency or interlatency of the auditory evoked potentials in both groups of women: healthy pregnant and pre-eclamptic have been found. The amplitudes of the analyzed components of visual, auditory and somatosensory evoked potentials did not differ significantly in both groups. The positive correlation of the latency of component P100 of visual and N20 of somatosensory evoked potentials with MAP (mean arterial pressure) has been observed. In conclusion, pre-eclampsia causes abnormalities in visual and somatosensory evoked potentials. It is assumed that angiogenic changes in brain are the most probable cause of the abnormalities of visual and somatosensory evoked potentials. The practical aspect of neurophysiological research concerning the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia has been indicated.",preeclampsia
"Background: Patients with preeclampsia have higher circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). However, whether circulating ADMA is elevated before the diagnosis of preeclampsia has not been determined. Methods: A meta-analysis of observational studies that reported circulating ADMA level before the onset of preeclampsia was performed. Pubmed and Embase were searched. Standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate the differences in circulating ADMA. A random effect model or a fixed effect model was applied depending on the heterogeneity. The predictive efficacy of circulating ADMA for the incidence of preeclampsia was also explored. Results: Eleven comparisons with 1338 pregnant women were included. The pooled results showed that the circulating ADMA was significantly higher in women who subsequently developed preeclampsia as compared with those did not (SMD: 0.71, p < 0.001) with a moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 43%). Stratified analyses suggested elevation of circulating ADMA is more remarkable in studies with GA of ADMA sampling ≥ 20 weeks (SMD: 0.89, p < 0.01) as compared those with GA of ADMA sampling < 20 weeks (SMD: 0.56, p < 0.01; p for subgroup interaction = 0.03). Differences of maternal age, study design, and ADMA measurement methods did not significantly affect the results. Only two studies evaluated the potential predicting ability of circulating ADMA for subsequent preeclampsia, and retrieved moderate predictive efficacy. Conclusions: Circulating ADMA is elevated before the development of preeclampsia. Studies are needed to evaluate the predictive efficacy of ADMA for the incidence of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Introduction: Altered maternal inflammatory responses may play a role in the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy like preeclampsia, its more severe early-onset form and intrauterine growth restriction. We evaluated the relation of common allelic variants of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), known to impair the inflammatory response, with the susceptibility to early-onset preeclampsia in Central Greece. Methods: We compared the occurrence of TLR4 (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) alleles in heterozygous (A/G, C/T) and homozygous (G/G, T/T) states in 84 women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia and 94 age matched controls with a history of only uneventful pregnancies, by direct sequencing. Results: Heterozygous TLR4 allelic variants were more common in women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia than in controls (GA for Asp299Gly: 14.3% vs 6.4% (AA), p = 0.053 & CT for Thr399Ile: 16.7% vs. 6.4% (CC), p = 0.019) and a stronger association was obtained when homozygous allelic carriers were also included (GA/GG for Asp299Gly: 16.7% vs. 6.4% (AA), p = 0.03 & TC/TT for Thr399Ile: 19.0% vs. 6.4% (CC), p = 0.01). Discussion: We recorded association between common TLR4 gene variants and early-onset preeclampsia. Our findings support the involvement of maternal innate immune system in severe hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and point to the potential value of maternal TLR4 polymorphisms as predictors-risk factors of susceptibility to early-onset preeclampsia in Central Greece.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that remains a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preeclampsia can be resolved by delivery, and most of the proposed preventive treatment approaches are based on processes involved in placental development in early pregnancy. Yet, none of these has been established in clinical practice. Low-dose aspirin is the most promising candidate, nevertheless; while some individual randomized controlled trials showed minimal or no statistically significant benefit, recent metanalyses showed that early initiation before 16 weeks of gestation is associated with prevention of early-onset preeclampsia and reduction in prevalence of perinatal death or morbidity of pregnant women. Heparin could be an alternative antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory median to prevent preeclampsia either alone or in combination with aspirin; however, results are conflicting concerning efficacy.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Delayed postpartum preeclampsia is a poorly studied disorder. We compared new onset delayed postpartum preeclampsia (NOPP) to recurrent/persistent, delayed onset postpartum preeclampsia (RPP) to see whether these were different disorders. Methods: Delayed onset preeclampsia was defined as readmission >2 days to ≤ 6 weeks postpartum for preeclampsia. The NOPP group had no antecedent diagnosis of hypertensive disorders in the current pregnancy, and was compared to the RPP defined as a prior hypertensive disorder in the current pregnancy in terms of maternal demographics, obstetric and medical history, intrapartum and early postpartum course and clinical signs and symptoms and outcomes on postpartum readmission. Results: There were a total of 56 (36.8%) patients in the RPP and 96 (63.2%) patients in the NOPP groups. NOPP cases delivered significantly later 39.0 ± 2 weeks vs. 37 ± 3.0 weeks p < 0.001, and had significantly lower blood pressure during the antepartum, early postpartum and readmission periods. In addition the NOPP group had significantly higher average number of symptoms 2 vs. 1.5 p = 0.013 on postpartum readmission. There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of major complications. Conclusions: In this comprehensive study of delayed postpartum preeclampsia, there were few significant differences in the clinical course and no differences in complications in the NOPP subgroup compared to cases with preeclampsia recurring in the late postpartum period.",preeclampsia
"Serious retinal detachment secondary to choroidal ischaemia is an unusual but well-documented cause of visual loss in preeclampsia. Very few cases have been reported in the literature. We report a case of a 26-year-old multigravida with pre-eclampsia who developed bilateral choroidal ischaemia with serious retinal detachments. There was spontaneous resolution of the serous detachment and the choroidal changes in the post-partum period, with residual pigment epithelial changes. Serous retinal detachments in pre-eclampsia are secondary to choroidal ischaemia and disturbances in the choroidal vascular supply.",preeclampsia
"One of the features of preeclampsia is impaired blood rheology due to altered erythrocyte aggregation and erythrocyte deformability. We investigated these two parameters which affect the viscosity of blood, along with serum and intraerythrocytic magnesium concentrations, immunoglobulin titres and fibrinogen concentration in 12 preeclamptic women. Eighteen (18) other non-preeclamptic, gestation-matched women acted as controls. Erythrocyte deformability, expressed as elongation index (EI), and erythrocyte aggregation expressed as aggregation half-time (t 1/2) were measured with the Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyser (LORCA). Serum and intraerythrocytic magnesium concentrations were analysed by atomic absorption spectrometry, immunoglobulin titres by radial immunodiffusion and fibrinogen concentration by a clot weight technique. There was no statistically significant difference in these parameters between preeclamptics and controls suggesting that erythrocyte deformability and aggregation as well as serum and intraerythrocytic concentrations, fibrinogen levels and immunoglobulin titres are not altered in preeclampsia. Further investigations are required in severe preeclampsia and in preeclamptic women taking magnesium sulphate supplement.",preeclampsia
Preeclampsia is one of the most common complications in the last half of pregnancy. Mother-baby nurses are often present at the birth to provide neonatal care as well as ongoing care during the first days of life. This article discusses the implications of preeclampsia for the neonate and the role of the mother-baby nurse in the care of these infants.,preeclampsia

"The risk for an adverse pregnancy outcome is markedly higher in women with history of preeclampsia. This may stem from impaired placentation in early gestation and from high impedance to flow in uteroplacental circulation. The renin-angiotensin system is one of the mediators of the remodeling of spiral arteries throughout pregnancy. The D allele of the Insertion/Deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the ACE gene has been associated with higher ACE activity, accounting for 47% of the total phenotypic variance of serum enzyme levels. To investigate whether the ACE I/D polymorphism affects maternal uteroplacental and fetal umbilical circulation and the pregnancy outcome in women with a history of preeclampsia, 106 women underwent Doppler examination of uterine arteries resistance index and umbilical artery pulsatility index at the 16th, 20th, and 24th weeks of gestation and were genotyped for the I/D polymorphism. This study found a difference in genotype distribution (P=0.0002) and allele frequency (P<0.0001) between women with and those without preeclampsia recurrence and fetal growth restriction as well as an association (P=0.0007) between DD genotype and risk of recurrent preeclampsia or fetal growth restriction. At the 16th, 20th, and 24th weeks, uterine artery resistance indexes were significantly lower in II, higher in DD, and intermediate in ID genotype carriers, whereas the umbilical artery pulsatility index values were significantly higher in the DD group in comparison to ID and II genotypes. The current study shows that the ACE I/D polymorphism affects uteroplacental and umbilical flows and the recurrence of an adverse pregnancy outcome in women with history of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"A case of severe pre-eclampsia, with histologically proven eclamptogenic glomerulopathy, appearing in the 32nd wk of the 4th pregnancy is presented. During 'conservative' management with bed-rest and sodium restriction, further deterioration of circulation took place.

"Background: In this study we explored preeclampsia through a bioinformatics approach. We create a comprehensive genes/proteins dataset by the analysis of both public proteomic data and text mining of public scientific literature. From this dataset the associated protein-protein interaction network has been obtained. Several indexes of centrality have been explored for hubs detection as well as the enrichment statistical analysis of metabolic pathway and disease. Results: We confirmed the well known relationship between preeclampsia and cardiovascular diseases but also identified statistically significant relationships with respect to cancer and aging. Moreover, significant metabolic pathways such as apoptosis, cancer and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction have also been identified by enrichment analysis. We obtained FLT1, VEGFA, FN1, F2 and PGF genes with the highest scores by hubs analysis; however, we also found other genes as PDIA3, LYN, SH2B2 and NDRG1 with high scores. Conclusions: The applied methodology not only led to the identification of well known genes related to preeclampsia but also to propose new candidates poorly explored or completely unknown in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, which eventually need to be validated experimentally. Moreover, new possible connections were detected between preeclampsia and other diseases that could open new areas of research. More must be done in this area to resolve the identification of unknown interactions of proteins/genes and also for a better integration of metabolic pathways and diseases.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a syndrome of unknown etiology characterized by the sequential development of facial and hand edema, hypertension, and proteinuria after the 20th week of gestation. Patients with preeclampsia may progress to a seizure-like state: The patient is then said to have eclampsia. The major goal of prenatal care is detecting the early onset of preeclampsia and to activate aggressive therapy to prevent severe complications either for the mother or the fetus. There currently are no specific forms of therapy to prevent the disease.",preeclampsia
"Background: Maternal mortality ratio is 276 per 100,000 live births in Pakistan. Eclampsia is responsible for one in every ten maternal deaths despite the fact that management of this disease is inexpensive and has been available for decades. Many studies have shown that health care providers in low and middle-income countries have limited training to manage patients with eclampsia. Hence, we aimed to explore the knowledge of different cadres of health care providers regarding aetiology, diagnosis and treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia and current management practices. Methods: We conducted a mixed method study in the districts of Hyderabad and Matiari in Sindh province, Pakistan. Focus group discussions and interviews were conducted with community health care providers, which included Lady Health Workers and their supervisors; traditional birth attendants and facility care providers. In total seven focus groups and 26 interviews were conducted. NVivo 10 was used for analysis and emerging themes and sub-themes were drawn. Results: All participants were providing care for pregnant women for more than a decade except one traditional birth attendant and two doctors. The most common cause of pre-eclampsia mentioned by community health care providers was stress of daily life: the burden of care giving, physical workload, short birth spacing and financial constraints. All health care provider groups except traditional birth attendants correctly identified the signs, symptoms, and complications of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia and were referring such women to tertiary health facilities. Only doctors were aware that magnesium sulphate is recommended for eclampsia management and prevention; however, they expressed fears regarding its use at first and secondary level health facilities. Conclusion: This study found several gaps in knowledge regarding aetiology, diagnosis and treatment of pre-eclampsia among health care providers in Sindh. Findings suggest that lesser knowledge regarding management of pre-eclampsia is due to lack of refresher trainings and written guidelines for management of pre-eclampsia and presentation of fewer pre-eclamptic patients at first and secondary level health care facilities. We suggest to include management of pre-eclampsia in regular trainings of health care providers and to provide management protocols at all health facilities.

"Malondialdehyde, as a biomarker of oxidative stress in pre-eclampsia, is discussed in terms of the determination methods, the validity of the obtained data, and variations in different studies, and it is concluded that there is a need for re-validation of the analytical methods and re-evaluation of its role as a biomarker of oxidative stress.",preeclampsia
"The aim of this study was to determine if women with preeclampsia or delivering small for gestational age (SGA) babies are more likely to have a short duration of sexual relationship compared with those who have uncomplicated pregnancies. In a prospective cohort study, 2507 nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies were interviewed at 15+/-1 weeks gestation about the duration of their sexual relationship with the biological father. Short duration of sexual relationship (< or =6 months, < or =3 months, or first intercourse) was compared between women with preeclampsia (N=131) or SGA babies (N=263) and those with uncomplicated pregnancies (N=1462). Short duration of sexual relationship was more common in women with preeclampsia compared with uncomplicated pregnancies (< or =6 months 14.5% versus 6.9%, adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 1.88, 95% CI 1.05-3.36; < or =3 months 6.9% versus 2.5%, adjOR 2.32, 95% CI 1.03-5.25; first intercourse 1.5% versus 0.5%, adjOR 5.75, 95% CI 1.13-29.3). Although the total number of semen exposures was lower in SGA, SGA was not associated with a shorter duration of sexual relationship. On post hoc analysis, the subgroup of SGA with abnormal uterine artery Doppler at 20 weeks (N=58) were more likely to have had a short sexual relationship compared with controls (< or =6 months adjOR 2.33, 95% CI 1.09-4.98; < or =3 months adjOR 3.22, 95% CI 1.18-8.79; first intercourse adjOR 8.02, 95% CI 1.58-40.7). We conclude that compared to uncomplicated pregnancies, short duration of sexual relationship is more common in women who develop preeclampsia and women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler waveforms who deliver an SGA baby.",preeclampsia
"Purpose: To investigate serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels and endothelial function in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and to clarify their relationship with uterine artery Doppler velocimetry. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 70 pregnant women (35 patients with pre-eclampsia and 35 age-matched normotensive healthy pregnant women) during the third trimester of pregnancy. The maternal levels of serum hs-CRP were determined in all cases by immunonephelometry. Uterine artery Doppler velocimetry was performed. Flow-mediated dilatation was measured by sonography of the brachial artery for the assessment of endothelial function. Results: Serum hs-CRP levels were higher in the pre-eclamptic group than in the normotensive group. hs-CRP levels were positively correlated with mean arterial pressure. Eleven patients with pre-eclampsia had abnormal uterine artery Doppler velocimetry. hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in pre-eclamptic patients with than without abnormal uterine artery Doppler velocimetry. Endothelial function was inversely correlated with hs-CRP levels and mean arterial pressure. Conclusions: These findings suggest that maternal serum hs-CRP levels increase with the severity of pre-eclampsia, reflecting endothelial dysfunction and constituting a potential marker of pathological utero-placental perfusion, with a high risk for fetal growth restriction.",preeclampsia
"Two hundred primiparae underwent continuous-wave Doppler investigation of the uteroplacental circulation at 18-20 weeks gestation as a possible screening test for hypertension in pregnancy. Seventy-five women with abnormal waveforms suggestive of high uteroplacental resistance were tested again at 24 weeks when 21 demonstrated a persistent abnormality. Only nine (43%) of these went on to have an uncomplicated pregnancy, as compared with 150 (84%) of the remainder. Seventeen (8.5%) of the women in the study developed a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, five of whom had abnormal waveforms at 18-20 weeks and at 24 weeks. These five women had a more severe degree of hypertension with proteinuria or intra-uterine growth retardation, and two required clinical intervention before term. The remaining 12 women were delivered at term of average, or heavier than average babies. Doppler investigation of the uteroplacental circulation at 24 weeks may prove to be a sensitive screening test for later severe pre-eclampsia with intra-uterine growth retardation.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy are at high risk of developing future chronic diseases, including premature cardiovascular disease. We have established an interdisciplinary clinic that aims to prevent cardiovascular disease through educational counselling focused on lifestyle modifications in the early postpartum period. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in weight and cardiovascular risk factors in participating women after six months of attendance at the clinic. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of women who had a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia, and who subsequently attended the Postpartum Preeclampsia Clinic. Study subjects had baseline assessments of lifestyle, physical, and laboratory parameters. Individualized goals for cardiovascular risk reduction and lifestyle were established, centering on physical activity and dietary modifications. The primary outcome was change in weight. Results: Over the study period, 21 women were seen for a minimum of six months of follow-up. At an average (± SD) of 4.4 ± 1.4 months postpartum, subjects showed a non-significant improvement in weight (mean weight loss of 0.4 ± 4.5 kg) and BMI (mean decrease in BMI 0.1 ± 1.7 kg/m2). Physical activity improved significantly, from 14% of subjects participating in physical activity before pregnancy to 76% at a mean of 4.4 months postpartum. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated the early benefits of a longitudinal interdisciplinary intervention with counselling about lifestyle modifications for prevention of cardiovascular disease in women with recent preeclampsia. A study with a larger sample size and longer duration of follow-up is planned to confirm these findings.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To study the effect of aspirin in the prevention of pre-eclampsia in high-risk women. Design: Randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Maternity clinics in ten Finnish hospitals participating in the PREDO Project. Sample: A total of 152 women with risk factors for pre-eclampsia and abnormal uterine artery Doppler velocimetry. Methods: Participants were randomised to start either aspirin 100 mg/day or placebo at 12 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks + days of gestation. Because of the limited power of this trial, we also conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials that included data on 346 women with abnormal uterine artery Doppler flow velocimetry, and aspirin 50-150 mg/day started at or before 16( ) weeks of gestation. Main outcome measure: Pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension and birthweight standard deviation (SD) score. Outcome measures for the meta-analysis were pre-eclampsia, severe pre-eclampsia, preterm (diagnosed <37 + 0 weeks of gestation) and term pre-eclampsia. Results: From the 152 randomised women, 121 were included in the final analysis. Low-dose aspirin did not reduce the rate of pre-eclampsia (relative risk [RR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.3-1.7); gestational hypertension (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.6-4.2); early-onset pre-eclampsia (diagnosed <34 + 0 weeks of gestation) (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.03-2.1); or severe pre-eclampsia (RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1-1.3); and the results were not statistically significant in an intention-to-treat analysis. However, our meta-analysis, including the current data, suggested that low-dose aspirin initiated before 16 weeks of gestation reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.8) and severe pre-eclampsia (RR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7). Conclusions: Our trial showed no statistically significant effect of aspirin in preventing pre-eclampsia in high-risk women. However, our meta-analysis suggested that aspirin may reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Aims/hypothesis: The aim of this study was to investigate whether components of the renin-angiotensin system and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) are associated with the development of pre-eclampsia in women with type 1 diabetes. Methods: This was an observational study of 107 consecutive pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (median duration 16 years [range 1-36 years], HbA(1c) 6.6% [range 4.9-10.5%]) in early pregnancy. At 8, 14, 21, 27 and 33 weeks and once within 5 days postpartum, blood was sampled for measurements of prorenin, renin, angiotensinogen, ACE and SSAO. HbA(1c), blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion were recorded. Pre-eclampsia was defined as blood pressure >140/90 mmHg and proteinuria ≥300 mg/24 h after 20 weeks. Results: Pre-eclampsia developed in nine women (8%) with longer diabetes duration (median 20 [range 10-32] vs 16 [range 1-36] years, p = 0.04), higher SSAO concentrations (592 [range 372-914] vs 522 [range 264-872] mU/l, p = 0.04) and a tendency towards higher prorenin levels (136 [range 50-296] vs 101 [range 21-316] ng angiotensin I ml(-1) h(-1), p = 0.06) at 8 weeks compared with women without pre-eclampsia. Levels of renin, angiotensinogen and ACE did not differ in the two groups. Throughout pregnancy, prorenin and SSAO levels were 30% (p = 0.004) and 16% (p = 0.04) higher, respectively, in women developing pre-eclampsia. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, prorenin concentration at 8 weeks was associated with pre-eclampsia (OR 4.4 [95% CI 1.5-13.0], p = 0.007), i.e. an increase of prorenin of 100 ng angiotensin I ml(-1) h(-1) implies a 4.4 times higher risk of subsequent pre-eclampsia. Conclusions/interpretation: In type 1 diabetic women with pre-eclampsia, a higher concentration of prorenin in early pregnancy and higher levels of prorenin and SSAO throughout pregnancy were seen.",preeclampsia

"We present two cases of Bell's palsy, and another with tinnitus, all in association with pre-eclampsia in the third trimester of pregnancy. We also systematically reviewed the published literature on both Bell's palsy and tinnitus in pregnancy and the puerperium using Medline from January 1966 to October 1998, and searched through the references from review articles and original research publications for further studies. Studies were limited to those published in the English language. We then pooled the rates of occurrence for Bell's palsy according to trimester of pregnancy, and postpartum, as well as the associated prevalence of pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension. We found that the majority of cases of Bell's palsy arose during the third trimester (pooled event rate 71.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 64.1-77.2), while almost none arose in the first trimester. During the postpartum period, the distribution of Bell's palsy was 21.3% (95% CI 15.7-28.1) of all cases, with the majority arising within days of delivery. Gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia was present in 22.2% of cases (95% CI 12.5-36.4), well above the 5% rate in the general population. Only one paper provided data on tinnitus in pregnancy, with the distribution equal across all three trimesters. When compared to non-pregnant controls, the odds ratio for the development of tinnitus during pregnancy was 2.8 (95% CI 1.0-8.1). In conclusion, Bell's palsy, and perhaps, tinnitus, occur more frequently during the third trimester of pregnancy. Both may be presenting prodromal signs of underlying early pre-eclampsia. The pathophysiologic mechanism relating these two entities to pre-eclampsia is also discussed.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is a common disorder that particularly affects first pregnancies. The clinical presentation is highly variable but hypertension and proteinuria are usually seen. These systemic signs arise from soluble factors released from the placenta as a result of a response to stress of syncytiotrophoblast. There are two sub-types: early and late onset pre-eclampsia, with others almost certainly yet to be identified. Early onset pre-eclampsia arises owing to defective placentation, whilst late onset pre-eclampsia may center around interactions between normal senescence of the placenta and a maternal genetic predisposition to cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The causes, placental and maternal, vary among individuals. Recent research has focused on placental-uterine interactions in early pregnancy. The aim now is to translate these findings into new ways to predict, prevent, and treat pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To investigate the relationship between two polymorphisms immediately upstream of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) gene and preeclampsia in a South West Han Chinese population. Methods: Blood samples from 205 patients with preeclampsia and 276 normal pregnant women as controls from Han Chinese in Chengdu area were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Results: G and A allele frequencies for -1195G>A site were 48.54% and 51.46% in the patient group, respectively, and 40.40% and 59.60% in the control group, respectively. G and C allele frequencies for -765G>C site were 94.15% and 5.85% in the case group, respectively, and 94.38% and 5.62% in the control group, respectively. The AA genotype and variant A allelic frequencies of the -1195G>A SNP were significantly lower in patients with preeclampsia than in the control group (P<0.05), and the odds ratio for the risk of preeclampsia was 0.665 (95% CI: 0.444-0.982) in women homozygous for the variant COX2 A allele ( x²=4.233, P=0.047). The genotype and allele frequencies of the -765G>C polymorphism in patients with preeclampsia and controls showed no significant differences (P>0.05). Additional subgroup analyses (mild vs severe preeclampsia) of the two polymorphisms failed to reveal significant correlation for either genotypic or allelic frequencies. Furthermore, there was no significant association between the polymorphisms and blood pressure levels in the patient or control groups. Conclusion: COX2 -1195A homozygosity is associated with a decreased risk for preeclampsia in a South West Han Chinese population. On the other hand, the -765G>C polymorphism has no effect.",preeclampsia

"The association between human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and the development of preeclampsia (PE) was studied in 48 women with PE and their partners. In 20 of the families, the HLA antigens of the child were also determined. In 8 of 15 cases (53%) of primigravidae with PE, the child shared at least 2 paternal antigens with the mother, whereas this was the case in only 1 of 26 (4%) children of healthy mothers (p < 0.001). In contrast to this, none of 6 children of multigravidae with PE shared 2 paternal antigens with the mother. An increased homozygosity at the HLA-B locus was also seen in the children of primigravidae with PE (40 vs. 4%, p = 0.01).",preeclampsia
The pathophysiology of preeclampsia remains largely unknown. A number of circulating placenta-produced factors have been implicated in causing the endothelial dysfunction and the clinical phenotype characteristic of preeclampsia. Aim: Determination of serum levels of placental soluble fms-like tyrosine-kinase-1 (sFlt-1) in pregnant women with preeclampsia. Eleven pregnant women with preeclampsia and 11 healthy women (controls) were included in the study. Determination of sFlt-1 was done with ELISA. The mean serum sFlt-1 levels of pregnant women with preeclampsia were twice as high as that of women with normal pregnancy. The highest level of sFlt-1 was found in women with severe preeclampsia. In women with mild form of preeclampsia the sFlt-1 level was close to that of the controls. sFlt-1 appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and its serum levels can be used as a diagnostic marker of preeclampsia.,preeclampsia
"A human isoform of Collapsin Response Mediator Protein (CRMP) family proteins, CRMP-1, has been identified as a novel invasion suppressor. The aim of this study was to determine CRMP-1 expression pattern in placentas during normal pregnancy and elucidate the clinical significance of CRMP-1 expression in the placentas of women with early-onset preeclamptic pregnancies. We recruited 66 normal healthy pregnant Chinese women and 60 Chinese patients with preeclampsia [early-onset prereclampsia(ePE), n = 30 and late-onset preeclampsia(lPE) n = 30]. Gestational age-matched normal healthy pregnant women were used as controls of early-onset and late-onset preeclampsia, which were 23-33 + 6 weeks, n = 18 and control B: 34-40 weeks, n = 20). Quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze the expressions of CRMP-1 in placentas. Expression of CRMP-1 was detected in syncytio- and cytotrophoblasts of all groups using immunohistochemistry. CRMP-1 was most abundantly expressed in syncytiotrophoblasts, moderately in cytotrophoblasts and the intermediate trophoblasts especially in the first trimester. The placental expression of CRMP-1 is particularly striking in the first trimester and decreases throughout pregnancy. There is a significant increase in CRMP-1 expression in the placenta of ePE but not of lPE, as compared to gestational-matched controls. The aberrant upregulation of CRMP-1 expression may link to the mechanism of developing ePE.",preeclampsia
Objectives: Pre-eclampsia (PE) affects many women worldwide and remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal and maternal settings. Abnormal expression of placental microRNAs (miRNAs) may be associated with PE. Material and methods: This study was conducted to the relationship between IGF1 and the expression spectrum of miRNA in the placenta of preeclampsia patient. The expression of miRNA in placental tissue was compared between pre-eclampsia (n = 6) and normal pregnant women (n = 5) miRNA targets were studied by computer simulation and functional assays. The role of miRNA was verified in trophoblast cell lines by apoptosis assay and invasion assay. Results: There was a significant increase in miRNAs in the placenta of women with pre-eclampsia compared with patients with normal pregnancy. Luciferase assay confirmed direct regulation of miRNA. Conclusions: The expression of IGF1 and miRNA was significantly increased in the placenta of patients with pre-eclampsia.,preeclampsia
"The four major hypertensive disorders related to pregnancy are preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, preeclampsia superimposed upon chronic hypertension, and gestational hypertension. The development of hypertension and proteinuria in pregnancy is usually due to preeclampsia, particularly in a primigravida. These findings typically become apparent in the latter part of the third trimester and progress until delivery, but some women develop symptoms in the latter half of the second trimester, or intrapartum, or the early postpartum period. Preeclampsia is characterized as mild or severe. Severe hypertension, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, liver function abnormalities, and fetal growth restriction are features of severe disease. Laboratory evaluation should assess haemoglobin/hematocrit and platelet count, renal and hepatic function, as well as assessment of fetal well-being and growth. Timing of delivery is based upon gestational age, maternal and fetal condition, and the severity of preeclampsia. Maternal end organ dysfunction and nonreassuring tests of fetal well-being are indications for delivery at any gestational age. Antihypertensive treatment aims at protecting the mother from severe hypertensive encephalopathy, but may jeopardize the fetus. We recommend antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone) be given to women with preeclampsia at 26 to 34 weeks of gestation. Magnesium sulfate is more effective than phenytoin for prevention of eclamptic seizures.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia is one of the most important complications of pregnancy. About 16% of maternal death is associated with pre-eclampsia in Bangladesh. It is necessary to diagnose or to predict pre-eclampsia for minimizing maternal morbidity and mortality. This case control study was carried out in the department of Clinical Pathology, in collaboration with department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, from March 2011 to February 2012 which included 20 mild pre-eclamptic and 20 severe pre-eclamptic patients and 30 gestation matched normotensive pregnant women within 28-40 weeks of gestation. Serum iron profile was measured and PBF was done to observe the association of higher concentration of serum ferritin, serum iron, percent saturation of total iron binding capacity, hemoglobin and lower level of total iron binding capacity, increased neutrophil count and decreased platelet count with pre-eclampsia. The mean serum ferritin concentration of mild pre-eclamptic group 99.91±7.84 ng/ml was 5 times and severe pre-eclamptic group 149.59±13.75 ng/ml was 8 times higher than that of control group 18.47±2.03 ng/ml. The mean serum iron level of mild pre-eclamptic group was (114.45±8.72 μg/dl) and in severe pre-eclamptic group was (174.35±13.59 μg/dl) and control group was (72.64±4.72 μg/dl) (p<0.05). The mean TIBC was higher and percent saturation was lower in control group than mild and severe pre-eclamptic group. The mean differences of iron parameters were statistically significant (p<0.05) among the three groups in ANOVA test. Both hemoglobin (gm/dl), total count of WBC and percentage of neutrophil were significantly higher (p<0.05) but platelet count was significantly lower in mild and severe pre-eclamptic group than normal control group. So higher concentration of serum ferritin, serum iron, percent saturation of total iron binding capacity and hemoglobin level increased and total iron binding capacity decreased in mild and severe pre-eclampsia than those of uncomplicated normal pregnancy.

"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is crucial for successful pregnancy. Its many functions include angiogenesis and immune regulation. Despite years of research, the etiology of preeclampsia remains unknown. Marked by insufficient trophoblast invasion and poor spiral artery remodeling, preeclampsia has also been linked to immune dysregulation. Here we discuss the roles of hCG in the context of endovascular cross-talk between trophoblasts and endothelial cells and immune tolerance. We propose that functional and glycosylation modifications of hCG may contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"The course of preeclamptic/eclamptic patients may be complicated by HELLP syndrome, a syndrome of intravascular hemolysis (H), elevated liver enzymes (EL) and low platelet count (LP). These patients typically present at early third trimester with epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, nausea and vomiting. They may present without the clinical signs of preeclampsia (hypertension and proteinuria or edema), thus an initial wrong nonobstetric diagnosis is not uncommon. The most frequent maternal complication is intravascular coagulopathy (30%). Placental abruption and acute renal failure are also common. Ten cases of maternal deaths were reported among 295 cases reviewed in the English language literature, while the perinatal mortality rate was 226/1000. The grave prognosis for mother and fetus warrants physician awareness in order to accomplish early diagnosis and proper management. This paper is a review of the literature in English.",preeclampsia
"Purpose: The challenge to obtain improved predictive tools, able to identify women destined to develop preeclampsia (PE), is raising the interest of researchers for the attractive chance to allow for timely initiation of prophylactic therapy, appropriate antenatal surveillance, and better-targeted research into preventive interventions. We aimed to gather all the evidence reported up to now in scientific literature relating to all prediction tests for PE.Materials and methods: We searched articles on conventional literature platforms from January 1952 to August 2016, using the terms ""preeclampsia,"" ""gestational preeclampsia,"" and ""gestational hypertensive disorders"" combined with ""predictive test"" and ""risk assessment."" Abstracts/titles identified by the search were screened by three investigators.Results: The search identified 203 citations, of which 154 potentially relevant after the initial evaluation. Among these studies, 20 full articles were excluded, therefore, 134 primary studies met the criteria for inclusion and were analyzed.Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that a combination of several features may provide the best predictive accuracy for the identification of PE. Large-scale, multicenter, multiethnic, prospective trials are required to propose an ideal combination of markers for routine screening.",preeclampsia
The R563Q mutation of the beta-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is associated with hypertension in black and mixed ancestry (MA) men and women in South Africa. The frequency of the R563Q mutation in black and MA women with pre-eclampsia (n= 230) and in controls (n= 198) was studied. The R563Q mutation was found in 7.8% of the women with pre-eclampsia and in 2.6% of controls (P= 0.014). This remained significant if the black women were analysed separately (P= 0.031). We have demonstrated that a genetic variant of the ENaC is associated with pre-eclampsia. This has implications for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of pre-eclampsia.,preeclampsia
"Ninety patients with severe preeclampsia were reviewed. There was one maternal mortality and two patients who developed pulmonary edema. The corrected perinatal mortality rate was 143/100. Epidural anesthesia did not adversely affect fetal outcome. Perinatal morbidity and mortality was mainly related to the development of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Twenty-three neonates developed respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS was strongly associated (P less than .001) with gestational age. RDS was not associated with mode of delivery, sex and perinatal asphyxia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To detect the relationship between endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphism and preeclampsia. Methods: The study included the samples from 62 subjects (15 preeclampsia pregnant women with their infants and 16 normal pregnant women with their infants). Screening for the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphism, the 27-bp repeat in intron 4 (eNOS4), was carried out by analysis of polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Results: The frequency of the b allele (420 bp) in the 62 samples was 91.93%, the frequency of the a allele (393 bp) was 6.45%, and that of the c allele (447 bp) was 1.61%. The frequencies of eNOS 4 b/b, eNOS 4 a/b and eNOS4 c/b were 83.83%, 12.90% and 3.27%, respectively. There was no significant difference of eNOS4 polymorphism between the preeclampsia pregnant women and the normal pregnant women, between their infants, and between the preeclampsia pregnant women and their infants. Conclusion: The eNOS 4 polymorphism may be not associated with preeclampsia. Further studies are needed to confirm the eNOS gene polymorphism with preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Egg donation (ED) enables infertile women to conceive. This results in a unique situation as the fetal genome is totally allogeneic to the mother. We discuss a 41-year-old woman whose pregnancy after ED was complicated by severe preeclampsia. We suggest that the pathophysiological mechanism of preeclampsia following ED differs from preeclampsia following non-donor conception. Due to the big differences between the maternal and fetal genome ED pregnancies represent an interesting model to study immunological interactions, as the allogeneic fetus is not rejected but tolerated by the pregnant woman. Knowledge of the immune system in ED pregnancies has broader significance as it may also give insight into immunological aspects of tolerance in solid organ transplantation.",preeclampsia
"Background: Preeclampsia is a common pregnancy-specific disorder associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. It has been proposed that the imbalance between two CD4+ T cell subtypes, regulatory T cells (Treg) and T-helper 17 cells (Th17), is involved in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Objectives: To determine the serum levels of IL-17, IL-21, IL-23 and TGF-β in patients with preeclampsia. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 30 preeclampsia patients, 30 normotensive pregnant women and 30 healthy individuals with no history of malignancies or autoimmune disorders based on simple sampling. The serum levels of IL-17, IL-21, IL-23 and TGF-β were measured by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The serum levels of IL-17 and TGF-β were significantly higher in preeclampsia patients compared to normal pregnant group and healthy individuals (p>0.0001) but interestingly, the opposite was the case for IL-23 (p=0.005). However, there were no significant differences in IL-21 between preeclampsia and normal pregnant group. Conclusions: Our results conclude that contrary to IL-21, serum levels of IL-17 and TGF-β significantly increased in preeclampsia compared to normal pregnant women, supporting an imbalance of cytokine profile in preeclamtic patients.",preeclampsia
"Major determinants of the colloid osmotic plasma status have been followed up in 90 pregnant women with various types and severity of toxemia. Toxemia of pregnancy was associated with normo-, hypo- and hyperosmotic states, and severe forms of it, such as pre-eclampsia, most typically coexisted with either increased or decreased osmolality. Toxemia of pregnancy was most severe in preexisting hypoosmotic states. Identification of abnormalities in the osmolality and colloid oncotic pressure may allow differential qualitative and quantitative selection of solutions for fluid therapy and appropriate infusion rates.",preeclampsia
"Purpose: Pre-eclampsia is a relatively common pregnancy disorder. Serum concentrations of certain pro-inflammatory molecules and cytokines like interleukin-23 may affect the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) gene plays an important role in the progression of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and IL-23 polymorphisms might influence the susceptibility of pre-eclampsia. The aim of the recent study was to establish the association between IL-23R gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility for developing of pre-eclampsia. Methods: One hundred and fifty-eight pregnant patients with pre-eclampsia and 153 controls were genotyped using RFLP-PCR and AS-PCR. Also, an in silico analysis was performed to predict possible effects of these variations on IL-23R mRNA and protein structures. Results: The frequency of the AG genotype of rs11209026 is related to a higher risk of pre-eclampsia. The mutant C and A allele in rs10889677 and rs11209026 SNPs, respectively, are correlated with the risk of pre-eclampsia and they are more frequent in severe late onset PE. We found higher frequency of the haplotype CG in patients with pre-eclampsia in comparison to healthy controls, as well as, the CG haplotype frequency significantly increased the risk of PE in severe, early onset, and late onset sub-groups. The results of computational analysis predicted rs11209026 and rs10889677 SNPs as functional variations, which can influence IL-23R mRNA and protein. Conclusions: The results of present study show positive association between polymorphisms in the IL-23R gene and pre-eclampsia. Therefore, the presence of IL-23R rs11209026, rs10889677 polymorphism might be markers for the genetic susceptibility to pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: The aim of this analysis was to demonstrate the association between melatonin levels and the development of preeclampsia. Methods: Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using a random effects model. Results: The pooled SMD between case and control was 1.40 (95% CI: 0.26, 2.55; P = 0.02). And the pooled SMD between mild PE and severe PE was 5.25 (95% CI: 1.5, 9.01; P = 0.006). Conclusion: The meta-analysis illustrated that melatonin concentration was significantly lower in women with preeclampsia, and correlated with the severity of the disease.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a systemic vascular disorder characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. This condition targets several organs, including the kidneys, liver and brain, and is the leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, recent evidence has revealed preeclampsia as a significant risk factor for future cardiovascular diseases in these women. Over the past decade, increasing evidence has indicated that maternal angiogenic imbalances caused by placental antiangiogenic factors play a central role in the systemic vascular dysfunction underling preeclampsia. The severity of the maternal antiangiogenic state correlates closely with maternal and perinatal outcomes. Assessing angiogenic imbalance and several vascular function tests have also emerged as a way of detecting systemic vascular dysfunction during pregnancy. This review summarizes the current understanding of the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, its clinical applications and clinical evidence for future cardiovascular risks.",preeclampsia
"The focus on disease mechanisms underlying the hypertension and proteinuria defining preeclampsia has increased knowledge of the pathophysiology yet we lack both therapy and predictors. We propose this is in part due to the fact that diagnostic findings identify a ""preeclampsia syndrome"" but do not necessarily indicate the most important pathophysiology nor if organs are involved as cause or consequence. The increased risk for later life cardiovascular disease in women who develop preeclampsia suggests the stress test of pregnancy exposes pre-existing subclinical vascular disease. The dogma that inadequate trophoblast invasion and ischemia/reperfusion injury to the placenta is ""the"" cause of preeclampsia is more relevant to early onset preeclampsia (<34 weeks). There is much less evidence for defective placentation in late onset preeclampsia where maternal constitutive factors or susceptibility to vascular damage is more relevant. The contribution of differing disease phenotypes to the syndrome may explain the inability of biomarker studies to identify all preeclampsia. Identification of phenotypes will require large amounts of prospective clinical data and biospecimens, collected in a harmonized manner with analysis in an unbiased discovery approach.",preeclampsia
"We analyzed the urinary sediment of 30 patients with severe preeclampsia every 4 hours during early labor, delivery, and the postpartum period. Fifteen normal control patients were also followed in a similar fashion. No casts were noticed in the urine samples of the control group. However, the urinary sediment of preeclamptic patients revealed the same uniform pattern regardless of the state of coagulation, or the presence or absence of oliguria or eclamptic seizures. Numerous granular and hyaline casts, red-cell, and tubular cell casts were identified during microscopic evaluation. These data reflect both glomerular and tubular damage in preeclampsia. We conclude that urinary sediment analysis in severe preeclampsia uniformly reflects renal parenchymal damage and does not correlate with or predict the clinical course of the disease.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To review the rate, risk factors, and potential prevention of preeclampsia in women with pregravid diabetes mellitus. Methods: Detailed review of recent English literature describing pregnancy outcome in women with pregravid insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 1 diabetes). The primary focus of the review is risk factors for preeclampsia and potential methods suggested for prevention of preeclampsia. In addition, pitfalls in diagnosis of preeclampsia will be emphasized. Results: The reported rate of preeclampsia ranged from 9% to 66%. This rate increased with increased severity of diabetes by White's classification, with the highest rate reported in women with pregravid diabetic nephropathy. Risk factors identified for preeclampsia were nulliparity, chronic hypertension, microalbuminuria prior to pregnancy, nephropathy, and poor glycemic control early in pregnancy. There is lack of agreement among reports in the literature concerning criteria used to diagnose preeclampsia. There are two randomized trials that included women with Type 1 diabetes who were randomized to receive either low-dose aspirin or placebo. There was no reduction in the rate of preeclampsia with low-dose aspirin in either trial. Conclusions: In women with pregravid Type 1 diabetes, the rates of preeclampsia and adverse neonatal outcome increase with increased severity of diabetes. Low-dose aspirin does not reduce rate of preeclampsia in such women. Further studies should address the role of good glycemic control prior to 20 weeks gestation and prevention of microalbuminuria.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: (1) To assess the recurrence rate of pre-eclampsia in women with this history before 34 weeks of pregnancy and thrombophilia. (2) To evaluate the effects of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on pregnancy outcome. Methods: In a multicentre retrospective study subsequent pregnancies of women with a history of pre-eclampsia necessitating birth before 34 weeks and thrombophilia were analysed. Of 58 women, 26 received LMWH and aspirin (ASA) and 32 ASA (22) or no (10) medication in their subsequent pregnancies. Results: In eight women treated with LMWH and ASA and in 16 women receiving ASA or no medication pre-eclampsia recurred in the subsequent pregnancy. (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.15-1.31) There were no significant differences in birth weight or gestational age between both groups. Conclusions: The recurrence rate of pre-eclampsia in women with thrombophilic disorders is high in this small retrospective study. No positive effect was found for LMWH treatment. A multicentred randomised study has been started to reach an adequate number of patients to evaluate the influence of LMWH treatment.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: A case-control study was conducted at Omdurman Maternity Tertiary Hospital, Sudan, during the period from May to August 2014 to investigate AMH level in women with preeclampsia compared to healthy controls. The cases were women with preeclampsia and healthy pregnant women were the controls. The obstetrics and medical history was gathered using a questionnaire. AMH level was measured using ELISA. Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups (40 in each arm of the study) in the age, parity and gestational age. Thirty-three of the 40 cases were patients with severe preeclampsia. There was no significant difference in median inter-quartile of the AMH level between the women with preeclampsia and the controls [0.700 (0.225-1.500) vs. 0.700 (0.400-1.275) ng/ml, P = 0.967]. In a linear regression model there was no association between the log of AMH and age, parity, gestational age, BMI, hemoglobin level and preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia prevention represents a major public health issue, as this vasculo-placental disorder generates a great burden of foeto-maternal morbi-mortality. Aspirin has proved its efficacy in primary and secondary pre-eclampsia prevention, especially when it is given at 150mg per day bedtime before 15 weeks of gestation to high-risk women. In the English trial ASPRE, high-risk women were identified by an algorithm taking into account angiogenic biomarkers ascertained at the end of first trimester of pregnancy. This article focuses on physiopathological mechanisms and risk factors of pre-eclampsia and on the interest of early angiogenic biomarkers dosing during pregnancy, for the assessment of pre-eclampsia risk. Unlike Great Britain or Israel, cost-effectiveness of this algorithm in general population has not been assessed in France. Finally, systemic lupus erythematous is at high risk of vasculo-placental disorders. Although few studies of angiogenic biomarkers dosing during lupus pregnancies identified a correlation between high sFlt1 levels at the end of first trimester and subsequent onset of severe vasculo-placental disorders, with a very good negative predictive value of sFtl1. Angiogenic biomarkers ascertainment for screening of vasculo-placental disorders in pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematous could allow targeting at best women needing an aspirin treatment and a closer monitoring.",preeclampsia
"Background: The aim of this study was to investigate whether impaired flow mediated vasodilation precedes the clinical manifestations of preeclampsia and whether is associated with inflammation. Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study in a prospective cohort of 506 normotensive women recruited before the 30th week of gestation (mean gestational age of 21.8 weeks). At enrollment, flow-mediated dilation was measured in the brachial artery using a 7.5-MHz transducer. C-reactive protein plasma concentrations and leukocyte count were also determined at study entry. Patients were followed until delivery, and medical records were reviewed for each patient to confirm the presence or absence of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. Results: Of the women studied, 14 developed preeclampsia, 18 developed gestational hypertension, and 474 remained normotensive. Two normotensive pregnant control subjects were randomly selected for each case, matched by maternal age, gestational age, and body mass index at enrollment. Women who subsequently developed preeclampsia had lower flow-mediated dilation (13.4% +/- 4.3% v 18.2% +/- 7.2, P = .026), higher C-reactive protein plasma concentrations (8.7 +/- 5.5 mg/dL v 5.3 +/- 4.3 mg/dL, P = .022) and leukocyte count (10.3 +/- 2.0 x 10(9)/L v 9.1 +/- 2.0 x 10(9)/L, P = .036) at study entry. Conclusions: Decreased flow-mediated vasodilation and higher levels of CRP are present in early stages of gestation in women who subsequently develop preeclampsia. These alterations occur before the onset of clinical symptoms of PE. Further studies are needed to confirm that flow-mediated dilation and C-reactive protein could be useful methods to screen women at risk of developing preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"The characteristic pathophysiological changes in pre-eclampsia are thought to be related to abnormalities of the maternal vascular endothelium. We suggest that the blood components that affect the risk of such damage are very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), which injure the endothelium, and toxicity-preventing activity (the pl 5.6 form of plasma albumin), which protects against VLDL-induced injury.",preeclampsia
"Aim: Over 40% of patients with pre-eclampsia are nonresponsive to antihypertensive therapy, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We examined the effects of plasma from nonresponsive and responsive patients on endothelial gene expression. Patients & methods: PCR array was performed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) incubated with plasma from nonresponsive (n = 4) and responsive (n = 4) patients. Gene networks and interactions with antihypertensive drugs used in pre-eclampsia were identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Results: Nifedipine and hydralazine act by upregulate or downregulate genes found to be downregulated or upregulated in HUVEC incubated with plasma from nonresponsive patients. Conclusion: Our novel findings suggest that plasma from nonresponsive and responsive patients evoke different responses in HUVEC, and might advance the pharmacogenomics research in pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"A number of groups are currently examining the potential of screening for pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes at 12 weeks' gestation. This can be performed at the time of combined first-trimester screening for aneuploidy using a similar method of regression analysis to combine multiple demographic and investigative factors. At present, research into the prediction of pre-eclampsia is more robust and is associated with the potential for therapeutic intervention that can reduce the prevalence of early-onset pre-eclampsia and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.",preeclampsia
"Using (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and statistical models, we sought to identify ''biomarkers'' present in erythrocytes that would distinguish between women with normal pregnancy and those suffering from preeclampsia, and investigate possible links with previously identified plasma ''markers.'' Erythrocytes from 22 normotensive pregnant women and 15 preeclamptics were analyzed by (1)H Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) NMR. Multivariate analysis and logistic regression were applied to differentiate between the 2 groups of patients, and used to develop a diagnostic model based on the concentrations of the constituents identified as being influential. Significantly higher concentrations of alanine (P < .001), glycine (P = .025), and ergothioneine (P = .049) were found in erythrocytes from preeclamptic patients. Discriminant analysis and regression of NMR data permitted 100% accurate diagnosis of the health status of new patients. Chemically related imidazole-based molecules, histidine and ergothioneine, are important in the classification process and the etiology of preeclampsia (PE).",preeclampsia
"Due to the participation of intracellular free calcium in the mechanisms of vascular smooth muscle contraction, and its importance in the physiopathology of essential arterial hypertension, its possible role in pre-eclampsia physiopathology, was investigated as a cellular model, platelets, were use, as they are similar to vascular smooth muscle cells. The study purpose was to investigate if intracellular concentration of ionized calcium is greater in the patients with pre-eclampsia than in normotensive pregnant women, and also, if there exists a correlation between intracellular calcium concentrations and arterial tension, Seven pre-eclamptic patients, diagnosed by the following criteria: arterial tension greater than or equal to 130/90 mmHg, edema and proteinuria, between 20 to 35 years of age, during the third trimester of gestation, without personal nor family antecedents of hypertension; none of them received treatment at the time, were studied. As control group seven normotensive pregnant women, equal by chronologic and gestational age, were included. Intracellular calcium in platelets was measured by Fluo-3-Am, and arterial blood pressure with conventional sphygmomanometer. Intracellular calcium and arterial blood pressure values, were compared, in both groups by Student's t, and analysis of lineal regression between intracellular calcium and mean arterial blood pressure, was done. Intracellular calcium was significantly greater in patients with pre-eclampsia, than the ones in the control group (142 +/- 5.6 vs 110 +/- 14 p less than 0.0001). Mean arterial blood pressure was also significantly greater in patients with pre-eclampsia (114 +/- 5 vs 83 +/- 3 p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",preeclampsia
"Introduction: Pre-eclampsia is one of the most commonly encountered hypertensive disorders of pregnancy that accounts for 20-80% of maternal mortality in developing countries, including Ethiopia. For many years, diet has been suggested to play a role in pre-eclampsia. However, the hypotheses have been diverse with inconsistent results across studies, and this has not been studied in Ethiopia. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary habits on the incidence of pre-eclampsia in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia Methods: A prospective multicentre unmatched case-control study was conducted among 453 (151 cases and 302 controls) pregnant women attending antepartum or intrapartum care in public health facilities of Bahir Dar City from June to September 2014. The interviewer conducted a face-to-face interview, measured the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and collected the mid-pregnancy haemoglobin level from clinical notes using a standardized and pretested questionnaire. Epi Info 3.5.3 was used for data entry and cleaning, while IBM SPSS Statistics 20 was used for data analysis. Backward stepwise unconditional logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the strength of association of predictive variables with the outcome variable and to control for the effect of confounding variables. A P-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result: For every 1-cm increase of MUAC, there was an increase in the incidence rate of pre-eclampsia by a factor of 1.35 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21, 1.51). A higher incidence of pre-eclampsia was found in women who reported to have consumed coffee daily during pregnancy (AOR=1.78, 95% CI: 1.20, 3.05). Similarly, for women who had anaemia during the first trimester, the incidence of pre-eclampsia was 2.5 times higher than their counterparts (AOR=2.47, 95% CI: 1.12, 7.61). This study also revealed consumption of fruit or vegetables at least three times a week during pregnancy to be protective against pre-eclampsia (AOR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.91; AOR=0.46, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.90, respectively). In addition, compliance with folate intake during pregnancy has shown a significant independent effect on the prevention of pre-eclampsia in this study (AOR=0.16, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.29). Conclusion and recommendation: Adequate vegetable and fruit consumption and compliance with folate intake during pregnancy are independent protective factors against pre-eclampsia. On the other hand, higher MUAC, anaemia and daily coffee intake during pregnancy are risk factors for the development of pre-eclampsia. Audience-specific education and promotion of the use of the protective factors identified in this study should be prioritized. The risk factors identified can be used for prediction and early diagnoses of pre-eclampsia allowing timely interventions to be performed to minimize deaths associated with severe pre-eclampsia/eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"From 1964 to 1984 (a 21-year period), out of 102.277 deliveries, there were 80 cases (0.8%) of eclampsia and 443 cases (4.3%) of pre-eclampsia. One patient (1.25%) with eclampsia died after delivery. Out of 539 children from mothers with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, 44 (8.2%) died after birth. The delivery of the greatest number of women with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia was terminated vaginally (81.5% and 77.5% respectively). In the prevention and treatment of convulsions the authors use Diazepam and also the antihypertensive drug Diazoxide, along with the administration of diuretics (Furosemide) if necessary. For the reconstitution of fluid, they apply plasma expanders, electrolyte solutions, and 10% glucose infusions. All patients with eclampsia should be delivered by the vaginal induction of labour or by caesarean section as soon as the convulsions are under control.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: To investigate the relation between antenatal clinic, obstetric day unit and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements and 24-hour proteinuria levels in hypertensive pregnancies. Design: An observational study. Participants: Forty-eight women presenting with new hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation. Results: The closest relation was found between ambulatory blood pressure measurements and 24-hour proteinuria levels. No significant relation was found between the conventional diastolic blood pressure threshold of 90 mmHg and 24-hour proteinuria levels. Conclusions: Ambulatory blood pressure measurement gives better information about disease status in pre-eclampsia as assessed by proteinuria than does conventional sphygmomanometry.",preeclampsia
"However, reports of the role of adiponectin in pre-eclampsia are conflicting. This study in Egypt investigated the association between serum adiponectin levels and pre-eclampsia and between adiponectin levels and some clinical and hormonal parameters. A sample of 60 pregnant women in the third trimester were divided into 3 equal groups: normal pregnancy, mild pre-eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia. Serum adiponectin levels in pre-eclamptic women were significantly higher than in normal pregnant women and the increase was more marked in cases of severe pre-eclampsia. There was a significant negative correlation between adiponectin levels and arterial blood pressure in all groups. However, there was no correlation between serum adiponectin and proteinuria or estradiol and progesterone levels. The results support the theory that adiponectin might be part of a feedback mechanism improving insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular health in pre-eclamptic patients.",preeclampsia
"Aim: The normal endovascular invasion of trophoblast cells and spiral artery remodeling are impaired in pre-eclampsia. Neither the circulating factor secreted by the placenta nor the cause of the widespread endothelial dysfunction in pre-eclampsia has yet been identified. In an attempt to identify novel factors, we performed a gene expression profiling study of placental tissue from women with and without pre-eclampsia. Material and methods: The study group comprised two pre-eclamptic patients with intrauterine growth restriction while the control group comprised three healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Gene expression was studied using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2 micro arrays. We focused on genes associated with angiogenesis. Some of the micro array analysis results were verified using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Gene expression profiling revealed that the expression level of nine genes--ECGF1, JAG1, Palladin, COL18A1, TNFSF12, VEGF, ANPEP, PDGFRA and SERPIN12 - was downregulated whereas the level of four genes--EPAS1, FLT1, SIGLE10 and ANG4--was upregulated in the study group compared with the control group. The real-time RT-PCR results from JAG1, COL18A1 and FLT1 genes were in accordance with the gene expression results. Conclusion: Our results show new targets for research to understand the mechanisms leading to pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
Preeclampsia is the main case of maternal and perinatal mortality. In women with preeclampsia antioxidant activity of plasma is decreased. Increased levels of of lipid peroxidation products may case peroxidative damage of vascular endotelium and result in clinical symptoms of preeclampsia.,preeclampsia
"Background: Oxidative stress has been related to several conditions during pregnancy (preeclampsia, abortions and premature rupture of membranes); it causes higher sensitivity of the endothelial blood vessel constriction and aggravates the endothelium dependent vasodilatación. Objective: To determine the oxidative stress level and histological changes in preeclamptic women's placenta. Patients and method: Longitudinal and comparative study. There were included 25 patients referred from second level health units (IMSS, ISSSTE and Hospital General de Zacatecas). To evaluate oxidative stress level, a sample of blood and placenta were obtained during delivery and a second sample was taken during mediate puerperium (10 days). Results: In control group, total lipidic peroxide levels in serum were 135.6 +/- 7.3 nmol of MDA/mL of serum, compared with the group of moderate hypertension, which registered 222.0 +/- 35.15 nmol MDA/mL. Total lipidic peroxides in serum during puerperium for control group were 150.4 +/- 30.8 and 183.3 +/- 18.51 nmol MDA/mL for the group of moderate hypertension. Placental lipoperoxidation for control group was 0.40 +/- 0.03 microg MDNg, and of 0.32 +/- 0.03 microg MDN/g for the group of mild hypertension. Patients of moderate hypertension group showed an increase at 34% on placental lipoperoxidation over control group. Placental histological alterations where characterized by vascular remodeling loss, deposits of proteinaceous material and macrophagic process. Conclusion: Total lipidic peroxide levels in serum increases during preeclampsia. Histological changes refer uterus-placental ischemia that, probably, induces the oxidative stress.",preeclampsia
"Computerized patent databases have made it possible to access a wealth of technological information contained in patent documents. Analysis of patent information can greatly help in monitoring technology trends and evolution as well as identification of research gaps. Detection and diagnosis of preeclampsia (PE) was chosen as a case study to emphasize the informative potential of patent analysis. PE complicates about 2-8% pregnancies, affecting a total of about 8.5 million women worldwide. PE can lead to potentially life threatening problems of the liver, kidneys, brain and blood clotting system of the mother. Risks for the baby include poor growth and prematurity. No effective ways of predicting or preventing PE have been found, which highlights the need for further research in this field. Some researchers believe that the incidence of PE is on the rise due to an increased prevalence of predisposing disorders, such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. PE thus represents a huge health care burden world over. Complications of PE might be prevented to a certain extent if diagnosed early. Patents on detection and diagnosis of PE were analyzed to gain a better understanding of the technical approaches followed by various research groups around the world.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Using (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and chemometrics, we sought to establish the metabolic profile for preeclampsia and to identify biomarkers that would permit a distinction between women with a normal pregnancy and those suffering from preeclampsia. Methods: Plasma samples from 11 normotensive pregnant women and 11 women with preeclampsia were analyzed. Principal component analysis was applied to differentiate between the two groups of patients. Results: Lipid concentrations were found to be significantly lower in the plasma of patients suffering from preeclampsia than those in normotensive pregnant women (p = 0.031). There is also evidence to suggest that ketone body constituents may contribute to the discrimination. Conclusion: (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolic profiling can detect patients with preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia affects 3-5% of pregnancies and can have a significant impact on health for both mother and fetus. Risk factors include maternal co-morbidities such as obesity and chronic hypertension, paternal factors, and genetic factors. New hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy are key diagnostic criteria, but the clinical features and associated prognostic implications are somewhat heterogeneous and may reflect different mechanisms of disease. Renal dysfunction and proteinuria correspond to the pathologic finding of glomerular endotheliosis, and generally resolve after cure of preeclampsia through fetal and placenta delivery. The molecular mechanisms behind this disease are being discovered and refined. The initial etiologic agents are currently unknown. Pathologic studies show abnormal development of an ischemic placenta with a high-resistance vasculature, which cannot deliver an adequate blood supply to the fetoplacental unit. Endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the maternal syndrome. Dysfunctional endothelial cells produce altered quantities of vasoactive mediators, which lead to a tip in the balance towards vasoconstriction. An imbalance in circulating angiogenic factors is emerging as a prominent mechanism that mediates the endothelial dysfunction and the clinical signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1), an endogenous anti-angiogenic factor that is a potent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonist, is highly elevated in preeclampsia. VEGF is not only important in angiogenesis, but also in maintaining endothelial health including the formation of endothelial fenestrae (a hallmark of the glomerular vascular endothelium). sFlt1 overexpression in animals induces glomerular endotheliosis with the loss of endothelial fenestrae that resembles the renal histological lesions of preeclampsia. More severe forms of preeclampsia, including the HELLP syndrome, may be explained by a concomitant elevation in both sFlt1 and soluble endoglin, another anti-angiogenic factor. Unraveling of the molecular mechanisms behind preeclampsia may help to expand our armamentarium to treat patients in a more directed fashion, as current management consists of supportive care and expedited delivery. Finally, long-term outcomes of women with preeclampsia include a significantly increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease, including mortality, which may warrant more aggressive screening and treatment in this population.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is the major cause of maternofetal and neonatal morbi-mortality including intrauterine growth retardation, miscarriages and stillbirths. Inadequate vascular dilation and angiogenesis represent the crucial underlying defect of gravidic hypertension, denoting a failed response to the vasodilatory and pro-angiogenic challenge imposed by pregnancy, especially if multifetal. A similar pathogenesis appears involved in gestational diabetes. In this review we aimed to provide a hint on understanding the deeply involved angiogenic disorders which eventually culminate in utero-placental failure. The key players in these complex processes may be found in an intricate network of growth factors (GFs) and GF inhibitors, controlled by several vascular risk factors modulated by environment and genes, which eventually impact on early and late cardiovascular outcomes of mother and fetus.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To evaluate the performance of screening for pre-eclampsia by uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks' gestation and the change in uterine artery PI between 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 and 21 + 0 to 24 + 6 weeks. Methods: In 3107 singleton pregnancies attending for routine care at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 and 21 + 0 to 24 + 6 weeks' gestation we recorded maternal characteristics and medical and obstetric history, and measured uterine artery PI. The distributions of uterine artery PI were made Gaussian after logarithmic transformation and the log of the ratio of uterine artery PI at 21 + 0 to 24 + 6 weeks to that at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks was calculated. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine which of the maternal variables and Doppler findings were significant predictors of early and late pre-eclampsia. The performance of screening was described by receiver-operating characteristics curves. Results: Pre-eclampsia developed in 93 (3.0%) pregnancies, including 22 (0.7%) in which delivery was before 34 weeks (early pre-eclampsia) and 71 (2.3%) with delivery at 34 weeks or more (late pre-eclampsia). Seventy-three (2.3%) women developed gestational hypertension, 346 (11.1%) delivered small-for-gestational-age (SGA) babies with no hypertensive disorders and 2595 (83.5%) were unaffected by pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension or SGA. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that maternal variables, uterine artery PI at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks and the change in uterine artery PI between 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 and 21 + 0 to 24 + 6 weeks' gestation provided significant independent contributions to the prediction of pre-eclampsia. For a false positive rate of 5% the predicted detection rates of early and late pre-eclampsia were 90.9 and 31.0%, respectively. The same performance of screening was achieved by reserving second-trimester testing for only the 20% of women at the highest risk after first-trimester screening. Conclusion: The decrease in uterine artery PI between 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 and 21 + 0 to 24 + 6 weeks is steeper in pregnancies with a normal outcome than in those developing pre-eclampsia. Effective screening for pre-eclampsia can be achieved by the Doppler measurement of uterine artery PI at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks and the change in PI between 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 and 21 + 0 to 24 + 6 weeks.",preeclampsia
"56 women who had had proteinuric pre-eclampsia and who had parous sisters were studied. In first pregnancy, proteinuric pre-eclampsia was more common in the sisters than in the maternity hospital population (8/71 [11%] vs 41/1978 [2%]); the relative risk was 6.0. The frequency of HLA DR4 was higher in sisters with pregnancy-induced hypertension than in sisters with normotensive pregnancies (8/18 [44%] vs 10/54 [19%]) and more of them shared HLA DR4 with their spouses (4/14 [29%] vs 0/29). Genetic susceptibility to pre-eclampsia is associated with HLA DR4; it may be conferred by fetomaternal sharing of a single recessive HLA-linked gene.",preeclampsia
"Plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was determined in pregnant women with preeclampsia, in normal pregnant and in nonpregnant women by a specific radioimmunoassay. Results did not show important differences between nonpregnant controls and normal pregnant women, but a significant rise was seen in women with preeclampsia compared to nonpregnant controls. Marked interindividual variation was found in all three groups. The mechanism of ANP release may differ between those women with normal pregnancy and those with preeclampsia. It is unclear whether the increased level of ANP in preeclampsia is an effect or a cause of the disease.",preeclampsia
"The diagnosis of preeclampsia, with all of its consequences, is at times difficult to establish, especially when the patient has underlying chronic hypertension and is not known from prior prenatal care visits. Many screening tests have been proposed. These should be sensitive, relatively specific, easy to perform, of low cost, and have a reasonable interval from prediction to disease onset. Laboratory assays would obviously be useful. We evaluated hemostasis tests for the diagnosis of preeclampsia, and compared fibronectin, antithrombin III and alpha 2-antiplasmin in 48 preeclamptics and 86 control nulliparas. Receive operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis suggested that fibronectin is the most effective of these tests. A similar analysis comparing the results of previous studies using serum iron, angiotensin infusion, urinary calcium/creatinine ratio, the rollover test and uric acid suggested a possible role for fibronectin in the diagnosis of preeclampsia. While not ideal, there seems to be, at present, no other, easy to perform laboratory test that outperforms fibronectin in predicting preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"In a community-based prospective study of black women, blood pressure (BP) before the onset of the first pregnancy was significantly higher in participants who were eventually diagnosed as having pre-eclampsia than those not so diagnosed. The diagnosis of ""pre-eclampsia"" appeared to be based entirely on BP; ""hypertension associated with pregnancy"" is probably a more accurate term. The BP of the pre-eclamptic group was consistently higher before admission to h ospital, during hospitalization, and at 6 weeks and 9 years after delivery. Daughters of pre-eclamptic mothers had higher BP than those of non-pre-eclamptic mothers; this difference was not apparent in boys. The data are compatible with a sex-limited subset of essential hypertension. It is perhaps estrogen-dependent, manifesting itself as mild ""pre-eclampsia"" in the mother and mild BP elevation in female offspring.",preeclampsia
"This report updates the 1990 ""National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group Report on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy"" and focuses on classification, pathophysiologic features, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Through a combination of evidence-based medicine and consensus this report updates contemporary approaches to hypertension control during pregnancy by expanding on recommendations made in ""The Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure."" The recommendations to use Korotkoff phase V for determination of diastolic pressure and to eliminate edema as a criterion for diagnosing preeclampsia are discussed. In addition, the use as a diagnostic criterion of blood pressure increases of 30 mm Hg systolic or 15 mm Hg diastolic with blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg has not been recommended, because available evidence shows that women with blood pressures fitting this description are not more likely to have adverse outcomes. Management distinctions are made between chronic hypertension that is present before pregnancy and hypertension that occurs as part of the pregnancy-specific condition of preeclampsia, as well as management considerations for women with comorbid conditions. A discussion of the pharmacologic treatment of hypertension during pregnancy includes recommendations for specific agents. The use of low-dose aspirin, calcium, or other dietary supplements in the prevention of preeclampsia is described, and expanded sections on counseling women for future pregnancies and recommendations for future research are included.",preeclampsia
"The Pregenesys Consensus Meeting held in Cambridge on 13 July 2009 was organized by the Pregenesys Consortium to review and critically discuss current knowledge regarding early markers of preeclampsia, to identify priorities and opportunities for future research, to consider issues that may need to be addressed in future recommendations and to highlight key issues in cost effectiveness and national policies concerning prediction and early screening for the risk of developing preeclampsia. This report summarizes the outcome of the Consensus Meeting and draws attention to issues for further investigation with specific regard to single versus multiple markers, early versus late risk identification, and the long-term effects on both maternal and perinatal health and the need to include these in any future cost-benefit assessment.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia has been frequently misdiagnosed as an entity unrelated to pregnancy, with resultant delay in appropriate management. In the case presented here, severe preeclampsia complicated by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (""HELLP syndrome"") in a 32-week twin gestation was misdiagnosed as acute appendicitis. Delay in diagnosis and an unnecessary appendectomy resulted in loss of one of the fetuses.",preeclampsia
"Background: Previous prospective cohort studies have shown that angiogenic factors have a high diagnostic accuracy in women with suspected pre-eclampsia, but we remain uncertain of the effectiveness of these tests in a real-world setting. We therefore aimed to determine whether knowledge of the circulating concentration of placental growth factor (PlGF), an angiogenic factor, integrated with a clinical management algorithm, decreased the time for clinicians to make a diagnosis in women with suspected pre-eclampsia, and whether this approach reduced subsequent maternal or perinatal adverse outcomes. Methods: We did a multicentre, pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial in 11 maternity units in the UK, which were each responsible for 3000-9000 deliveries per year. Women aged 18 years and older who presented with suspected pre-eclampsia between 20 weeks and 0 days of gestation and 36 weeks and 6 days of gestation, with a live, singleton fetus were invited to participate by the clinical research team. Suspected pre-eclampsia was defined as new-onset or worsening of existing hypertension, dipstick proteinuria, epigastric or right upper-quadrant pain, headache with visual disturbances, fetal growth restriction, or abnormal maternal blood tests that were suggestive of disease (such as thrombocytopenia or hepatic or renal dysfunction). Women were approached individually, they consented for study inclusion, and they were asked to give blood samples. We randomly allocated the maternity units, representing the clusters, to blocks. Blocks represented an intervention initiation time, which occurred at equally spaced 6-week intervals throughout the trial. At the start of the trial, all units had usual care (in which PlGF measurements were also taken but were concealed from clinicians and women). At the initiation time of each successive block, a site began to use the intervention (in which the circulating PlGF measurement was revealed and a clinical management algorithm was used). Enrolment of women continued for the duration of the blocks either to concealed PlGF testing, or after implementation, to revealed PlGF testing. The primary outcome was the time from presentation with suspected pre-eclampsia to documented pre-eclampsia in women enrolled in the trial who received a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia by their treating clinicians. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 16842031. Findings: Between June 13, 2016, and Oct 27, 2017, we enrolled and assessed 1035 women with suspected pre-eclampsia. 12 (1%) women were found to be ineligible. Of the 1023 eligible women, 576 (56%) women were assigned to the intervention (revealed testing) group, and 447 (44%) women were assigned to receive usual care with additional concealed testing (concealed testing group). Three (1%) women in the revealed testing group were lost to follow-up, so 573 (99%) women in this group were included in the analyses. One (<1%) woman in the concealed testing group withdrew consent to follow-up data collection, so 446 (>99%) women in this group were included in the analyses. The median time to pre-eclampsia diagnosis was 4·1 days with concealed testing versus 1·9 days with revealed testing (time ratio 0·36, 95% CI 0·15-0·87; p=0·027). Maternal severe adverse outcomes were reported in 24 (5%) of 447 women in the concealed testing group versus 22 (4%) of 573 women in the revealed testing group (adjusted odds ratio 0·32, 95% CI 0·11-0·96; p=0·043), but there was no evidence of a difference in perinatal adverse outcomes (15% vs 14%, 1·45, 0·73-2·90) or gestation at delivery (36·6 weeks vs 36·8 weeks; mean difference -0·52, 95% CI -0·63 to 0·73). Interpretation: We found that the availability of PlGF test results substantially reduced the time to clinical confirmation of pre-eclampsia. Where PlGF was implemented, we found a lower incidence of maternal adverse outcomes, consistent with adoption of targeted, enhanced surveillance, as recommended in the clinical management algorithm for clinicians. Adoption of PlGF testing in women with suspected pre-eclampsia is supported by the results of this study. Funding: National Institute for Health Research.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia along with its complications seems to be one of the major causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. Despite numerous studies, the etiology of pre-eclampsia has not yet been fully elucidated. The present study prospectively determines and evaluate whether maternal serum levels of calcium has any association with pre-eclampsia. It was a cross sectional study carried out in the department of Biochemistry, Mymensingh Medical College from July 2009 to June 2010. A total of 76 subjects were selected with the duration of pregnancy from 28th wks to term. Among them 42 were normal pregnant women and 32 were pre-eclamptic, admitted in the department of obstetrics and gynaecology Mymensingh Medical College Hospital. The mean±SD serum calcium of normal pregnant women and that of the pre-eclamptic were 7.62±0.24 and 7.32±0.28mg/dl respectively. There was significant (p<0.001) decrease in serum calcium in subject with pre-eclampsia in comparison to that of the normal pregnancy. So, level of calcium may be significantly decreased in pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"The objective of the current study was to determine whether homocysteine elevations precede the development of pre-eclampsia, and to examine the relationship between the occurrence of pre-eclampsia and the degree of hyperhomocysteinemia, so as to find a new prognostic parameter for women with liable to develop pre-eclampsia. The study comprised 103 pregnant females chosen of those attending the Antenatal Care Unit at Benha University Hospital and accepted to donate blood samples at the 16th week of gestation. Women, who delivered at Benha University Hospital, were retrospectively allocated into two groups: Control group (Group C): comprised 64 (71.1%) parturient, who completed their full term pregnancy without the development of pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia group (Group PEc): comprised 26 (28.9%) parturient who developed pre-eclampsia throughout their course of pregnancy but had completed their full term pregnancy. Through the present study, estimated fasting plasma tHcys levels were higher than the 90th percentile of the control group (> or = 5.1 ng/dl) in 6 (9.4%) women in group C and in 9 (34.6%) in group PEc. There was a significant (P<0.05) increase of fasting plasma tHcys levels in nullipara pre-eclamptic parturient as compared to multiparous control parturient. Also, a negative significant correlation was reported between parity and the fasting plasma tHcys level in pre-eclamptic parturient. The present results showed a significant increase of fasting plasma tHcys level in obese women with a positive significant correlation between fasting plasma tHcys level and BMI in PEc group. Thus, it can be concluded that hyperhomocysteinemia is an indirect risk factor for placental vasculopathy predating clinical pre-eclampsia, and can be used as a biomarker for identifying women at risk of complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes.",preeclampsia
"Placental apoptosis is exaggerated in pre-eclampsia and cytotrophoblast proliferation is enhanced. This imbalance may be a primary pathogenic event, whereby excessive syncytiotrophoblast apoptosis counters cytotrophoblast fusion, promoting the liberation of syncytial material which perturbs the maternal vascular endothelium. We have previously shown that primary trophoblasts and explant cultured villous fragments from pre-eclamptic pregnancies elicit greater levels of terminal differentiation and apoptosis. This review considers current opinions in trophoblast cell turnover in normal pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. In the context of other findings, this review highlights: (i) the disparity in expression of pro-apoptotic transcription factor p53 in the syncytiotrophoblast in pre-eclampsia, (ii) the importance of reactive oxygen species and hypoxia in initiating villous trophoblast apoptosis and (iii) the concept that aberrant intervillous haemodynamics, as opposed to oxygen per se, initiates excessive syncytiotrophoblast shedding. Finally, therapeutic ways of restoring the syncytiotrophoblast in pre-eclampsia and preventing excessive placental apoptosis are considered, including a role for mitotic manipulators and growth factor replacement strategies.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia remains an important worldwide cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Improved prediction of those destined to develop this condition would allow for timely initiation of prophylactic therapy, appropriate antenatal surveillance and better targeted research into preventive interventions. This paper reviews recent research into strategies for the prediction of pre-eclampsia, including the use of maternal risk factors, mean maternal arterial pressure, ultrasound parameters and biomarkers. The most promising strategies involve multiparametric approaches, which use a variety of individual parameters in combination, as has been established in first-trimester aneuploidy screening. The paper concludes with a discussion of the issues around the introduction of such testing into clinical practice.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: This study was performed to investigate whether the TXA2 synthase inhibitor, ozagrel, was effective in the treatment and prevention of pre-eclampsia. Study design: Ozagrel was administrated therapeutically to 4 severely pre-eclamptic women, and prophylactically to 5 pregnant women with histories of severe preeclampsia and complications. Results: The therapeutic administration (TA) of ozagrel improved hypertension and proteinuria. Two patients delivered appropriate-for-date (AFD) infants, whereas the other 2 patients delivered light-for-date (LFD) infants. Mean plasma concentrations of TXB2 (plasma TXB2) decreased, whereas plasma 6-keto PGF1 alpha were almost unchanged. The prophylactic administration (PA) of ozagrel prevented the occurrence of preeclampsia in 3 of the 5 patients. All delivered AFD infants. The duration of pregnancy was prolonged more than that of previous pregnancies in all patients. Plasma TXB2 decreased, whereas plasma 6-keto PGF1 alpha increased. Conclusions: PA prevented preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation, whereas TA improved only maternal symptoms. These results might justify a large prospective study to determine whether ozagrel is an effective prophylactic.",preeclampsia
"Background: The Finnish Pre-eclampsia Consortium (FINNPEC) case-control cohort consisting of 1447 pre-eclamptic and 1068 non-pre-eclamptic women was recruited during 2008-2011 to study genetic background of pre-eclampsia and foetal growth. Pre-eclampsia was defined by hypertension and proteinuria according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 2002 classification. The ACOG Task Force Report on Hypertension in Pregnancy (2013) and The International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP) (2014) have published new classifications, in which proteinuria is not necessary for diagnosis when specific symptoms are present. For diagnoses based on proteinuria, the ISSHP 2014 criteria raised its threshold to 2+ on dipstick. We studied how the new classifications would affect pre-eclampsia diagnoses in the FINNPEC cohort. Methods: We re-evaluated pre-eclampsia diagnosis using the ACOG 2013 and the ISSHP 2014 classifications in pre-eclamptic women whose proteinuria did not exceed 1+ on dipstick (n = 68), in women with gestational hypertension (n = 138) and in women with chronic hypertension (n = 66). Results: The number of women with pre-eclampsia increased 0.8 % (1459/1447) according to the ACOG 2013 criteria and 0.6 % (1455/1447) according to the ISSHP 2014 criteria. All 68 women with the amount of proteinuria not exceeding 1+ on dipstick diagnosed originally pre-eclamptic met the ACOG 2013 criteria but only 20 women (29.4 %) met the ISSHP 2014 criteria. Seven (5.1 %) and 35 (25.4 %) women with gestational hypertension were diagnosed with pre-eclampsia according to the ACOG 2013 and the ISSHP 2014 criteria, respectively. Correspondingly five (7.6 %) and 21 (31.8 %) women with chronic hypertension were diagnosed with pre-eclampsia according to the ACOG 2 013 and the ISSHP 2014 criteria. Conclusions: Only minor changes were observed in the total number of pre-eclamptic women in the FINNPEC cohort when comparing the ACOC 2002 classification with the ACOG 2013 and ISSHP 2014 classifications.",preeclampsia
"The effect of severe pre-eclampsia on the outcome of infants of very low birth weight was studied in a prospective case control study of 35 pairs of infants of comparable gestation. Significantly more infants were delivered before the onset of labour and by caesarean section in the group with pre-eclampsia. These babies tended to be smaller and had a higher incidence of hyaline membrane disease, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary air leak, and hypotension. They also required more intensive treatment with oxygen and mechanical ventilation. The significant difference in birth weight was still apparent at 2 years of age. Although the mean psychomotor developmental index and the incidence of specific neurodevelopmental impairments were not significantly different between the two groups, survivors in the group born to pre-eclamptic mothers had a significantly lower mean mental developmental index, and significantly more of these children had one or more impairments compared with the control group at 2 years of age.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy-related complication. Platelets are potentially important in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, and platelet function analyses may prove as sensitive preeclampsia biomarkers. This study aimed to systematically review and summarise the literature on platelet function markers in preeclampsia. This systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA and registered in PROSPERO. Relevant studies were identified through PubMed and Embase on 15/08/17. As platelet function markers platelet activation, platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion markers were included. If possible, relevant data were extracted for each marker to perform a meta-analysis of the mean difference between women with and without preeclampsia. All 69 included articles underwent quality rating. Some platelet activation markers, especially p-selectin and mean platelet volume (MPV), were significantly increased comparing the two groups of women, while others were not. The meta-analysis demonstrated that, overall, women with preeclampsia had significantly higher MPV than in women without preeclampsia. No significant difference was found regarding platelet aggreg`ation comparing the two groups. Platelet adhesion was investigated in noneof the included studies. In conclusion, further studies are warranted to investigate platelet activation markers future role as predictive markers in preeclampsia. MPV is suggested as the most promising biomarker for evaluating platelet function in preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To evaluate the effect of low birth weight adjusted for gestational age in first pregnancies on preeclampsia in second pregnancies and to estimate the proportion of preeclampsia in second pregnancies attributable to histories of LBW for gestational age. Methods: We conducted a cohort study based on linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, which covered all births in 1967-1992. Results: Women who delivered infants under the third percentile birth weight were three times more likely to have initial or recurrent preeclampsia in second pregnancies than those who delivered infants at or above the tenth percentile. After adjusting for maternal age, year of birth, interpregnancy interval, education, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and change of partner, the increased risk persisted. Birth weight below the tenth percentile in the first delivery accounted for 10% of the total cases of preeclampsia in the second pregnancy and 30% of recurrent cases. Conclusion: A history of low birth weight adjusted for gestational age is associated significantly with subsequent occurrence as well as recurrence of preeclampsia. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of a shared etiologic factor or recurrent pathophysiologic mechanism for preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. A history of fetal smallness for gestational age is found in a substantial proportion of all cases of preeclampsia and thus seems to be important in the etiology of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: Dysregulation of lncRNAs and the absence of coordination between them could affect the normal placentation, uteroplacental circulation, and endothelial cell function. All these misfunctions can finally lead to preeclampsia. Methods: In the present review, we discuss current literature (till May 2018) about lncRNAs expression and function in the placenta, trophoblast cells, and decidua. Results and conclusion: It is explained how altered expression of the lncRNAs and abnormal regulation of them affect the risk of preeclampsia. However, the interaction between various lncRNAs and coordinate regulation of them in health and failure of such coordinative mechanisms in diseases such as preeclampsia need to be elucidated.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a common and severe disease in pregnancy, a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The main features of the disease are de novo hypertension after the 20th gestational week and proteinuria, and it is frequently accompanied by edema and other subjective symptoms. The origin of the disease is the placenta, but its sequelae affect multiple organ systems. According to the two-stage model of preeclampsia, the abnormal and hypoperfused placenta (stage 1) releases factors to the bloodstream, which are responsible for the maternal symptoms (stage 2). Oxidative stress, impaired function of nitric-oxide synthase, cellular and humoral immunological factors play an important role in the pathophysiology of the placenta. Endothelial dysfunction is the common denominator of the clinical symptoms. The theory explains the origins of hypertension, proteinuria, edema and other symptoms as well.",preeclampsia

"Although an increased risk of pre-eclampsia in pregnancies conceived after infertility treatment has been reported, it remains unknown whether preconceptional minimalisation of known risk factors would help in preventing pre-eclamsia. Obesity and preconceptional blood pressure are discussed as major risks for the development of pre-eclampsia and low doses of aspirins, folic acid, statins and metformin are discussed as potential preventive treatments to decrease the risk of pre-eclampsia. In the present review we discuss whether present-day reproductive medicine could progress towards complication-free pregnancy.",preeclampsia
"Purpose of review: To summarize recent research findings related to first trimester prediction and prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with poor placentation. Recent publications related to prediction and prevention of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and stillbirth were reviewed. Recent findings: Researchers continue to identify markers that will help predict pregnancies that go on to develop preeclampsia through screening at 11-13 weeks. A number of multivariate algorithms describing risks for preeclampsia have been published and some of these have been validated in independent populations. A large randomized controlled trial has proven the efficacy of a first trimester prediction - prevention programme for preeclampsia with an 80% reduction in prevalence of disease leading to delivery less than 34 weeks. Screening tools for IUGR and stillbirth are less advanced and require further validation in other populations. The value of these models in preventing disease still needs to be demonstrated. Summary: Significant progress has been made in developing predictive and preventive strategies which can affect the prevalence of severe early-onset preeclampsia. This approach could be adopted for population-based screening aiming to prevent this disease.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To determine whether any simple, purely genetic mechanism can account for susceptibility to pre-eclampsia. Design: Six simple Mendelian models of inheritance were considered, and predictions concerning the incidence of pre-eclampsia in various family members of index cases were calculated for each genetic model. Data were then extracted from published family studies in which a suitable disease definition had been used, and compared to our theoretical expectations. Results: Only one of the genetic models considered, in which both mother and fetus must express the same recessive gene to confer susceptibility, was consistent with the observed incidence values for relatives of index cases. This model was also consistent with the putative association with HLA-DR4, but could not account for the comparative rarity of pre-eclampsia in parous women. Conclusion: Homozygosity for a single recessive gene shared by mother and fetus, unlike five other genetic mechanisms tested, is consistent with published family studies in pre-eclampsia, and should be considered the best working hypothesis at present.",preeclampsia
"Objectives: To evaluate the association between fetal fraction on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing and first-trimester markers for pre-eclampsia, and to investigate the possible association of low fetal fraction with increased risks for pre-eclampsia (PE) and fetal growth restriction (FGR). Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study including all women with a singleton pregnancy who had risk calculation for PE and FGR between 11 + 0 and 13 + 6 weeks' gestation and who also had cfDNA as a primary or secondary screening test for chromosomal abnormalities at any gestational age at two fetal medicine clinics in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, between March 2013 and May 2017. Logarithmically transformed fetal fraction results were adjusted for gestational age and maternal characteristics. Associations with mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI), pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), placental growth factor (PlGF), and risks for PE < 34 weeks, PE < 37 weeks and FGR < 37 weeks were analyzed using correlation analysis and univariable and multivariable linear regressions. Results: In total, 4317 singleton pregnancies that underwent cfDNA testing with fetal fraction reported were included. Significant prediction of fetal fraction was provided by gestational age, conception by in-vitro fertilization, maternal age, body mass index, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, South Asian ethnicity and being parous without history of PE or FGR. Fetal fraction was associated inversely with MAP and UtA-PI and associated positively with PAPP-A and PlGF. The lower the fetal fraction, the higher were the risks for PE < 34 weeks, PE < 37 weeks and FGR < 37 weeks (P < 0.001 for all). Conclusions: There is a significant association between fetal fraction result and first-trimester markers for adverse pregnancy outcome. Low fetal fraction is associated with an increased risk for pregnancy complication, but its capacity to act an as independent first-trimester marker in an algorithm for screening for PE and FGR requires further research.

"Preeclampsia remains a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. There have been no material advances in the treatment of preeclampsia for nearly 50 years. Combining in vitro studies and a clinical trial, we aimed to determine whether melatonin could be a useful adjuvant therapy. In a xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO) placental explant model, melatonin reduced oxidative stress (8-isoprostane) and enhanced antioxidant markers (Nrf2 translocation, HO-1), but did not affect explant production of anti-angiogenic factors (sFlt, sEng, activin A). In cultured HUVECs, melatonin mitigated TNFα-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule expression and rescued the subsequent disruption to endothelial monolayer integrity but did not affect other markers for endothelial activation and dysfunction. In a phase I trial of melatonin in 20 women with preeclampsia, we assessed the safety and efficacy of melatonin on (i) preeclampsia progression, (ii) clinical outcomes, and (iii) oxidative stress, matching outcomes with recent historical controls receiving similar care. Melatonin therapy was safe for mothers and their fetuses. Compared to controls, melatonin administration extended the mean ± SEM diagnosis to delivery interval by 6 ± 2.3 days reduced the need for increasing antihypertensive medication on days 3-4 (13% vs 71%), days 6-7 (8% vs 51%), and at delivery (26% vs 75%). All other clinical and biochemical measures of disease severity were unaffected by melatonin. We have shown that melatonin has the potential to mitigate maternal endothelial pro-oxidant injury and could therefore provide effective adjuvant therapy to extend pregnancy duration to deliver improved clinical outcomes for women with severe preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia, a major cause of morbidity in pregnancy, is still a disease of unknown cause, despite considerable research in recent times. We believe that progress in understanding the disorder would be enhanced if the systematic review methodology, similar to that used to assess data from clinical trials, is applied to studies that investigate the many theories advanced to explain its cause. This article discusses the need for and a frame work of such an endeavor. The systematic review approach helps to determine where research should be focused, to prioritize the use of resources, to understand, and then hopefully to conquer a disease that still kills mothers and infants each year, worldwide.",preeclampsia
"Problem: To investigate the expression of complement activation factors in plasma of patients with early/late-onset severe pre-eclampsia. Methods: A case-control study was performed. The study group consisted of 30 cases of early-onset severe pre-eclampsia (EOSPE) and 30 cases of late-onset severe pre-eclampsia (LOSPE). Thirty cases were selected as the early-onset control group (E-control) and 30 as the late-onset control group (L-control). ELISA was used to test C1q, C4d, MBL, Bb, C3a, C5a, and MAC in the maternal peripheral circulation. Results: The complement activation factors Bb, C3a, C5a, and MAC were increased significantly in EOSPE (all P<.01) and LOSPE (P value: .027, <.001, .001, and <.001, respectively) compared with E/L-control. C1q and C4d were increased significantly in LOSPE (P value: .003 and .014, respectively) compared with L-control. Conclusion: Abnormal activation of the complement system exists in the maternal circulation of patients with early- and late-onset severe pre-eclampsia. In patients complicated with LOSPE, the complement system was activated through both the classical and alternative pathways, while in EOSPE, the complement system was activated mainly through the alternative pathway.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To derive a prediction index based on the most salient patient history, laboratory, and clinical parameters for identifying women at high risk for developing preeclampsia (PE). Methods: Nonpregnant women with a history of PE (n = 101) were compared with nonpregnant parous women with a history of one or more successful normotensive pregnancies (n = 50) but with comparable age, gestation, and parity profiles. The parameters included a medical examination (demographics, patient history, family history, and clinical and obstetrical findings), laboratory investigations (hemostasis, coagulation, and vitamins), and morphological and functional tests (cardiovascular and renal functions). Stepwise logistic regression analysis was applied to develop a three-step PE prediction index based on the most discriminant parameters. Results: Patients with and without PE differed significantly (p < 0.05) with respect to 1) maternal history of chronic hypertension, body mass index, and blood pressure; 2) APTT, PT, activated factor VIII, homocysteine, free protein S and vitamin B1; and 3) relative plasma volume. Based on these three sets of parameters, a three-step PE prediction index was developed. The likelihood ratio of a positive index score was equal to 3.4, 7.3, and 8.8, respectively. Thus, assuming a PE prevalence (or prior probability) of 5%, a patient's chances of developing PE when presenting with a positive score on the three-step prediction index were 15%, 28%, and 32%, respectively. Discussion: In the absence of well defined pre-pregnancy screening guidelines for PE, the present study attempts to proceed in a stepwise fashion by looking at medical examination data first, requesting, if necessary, specific hemostasis and coagulation tests next, and finally measuring the relative plasma volume for confirmatory purposes. This approach offers a satisfactory positive predictive value and cost efficiency ratio.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia remains an important cause of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. Delivery is always the appropriate therapy for the mother but may be responsible for neonatal adverse outcomes, particularly when it occurs at less than < 34 weeks' gestation. In women with severe preeclampsia at < 34 weeks expectant management to improve neonatal mortality and morbidity may be performed under close monitoring of both the mother and the fetus. Any severe condition of the mother (HELLP syndrome, abruptio placentae, eclampsia) or the fetus (abnormal fetal heart rate) should lead to prompt delivery. In women with mild preeclampsia, expectant management should be performed until 38 weeks gestation.",preeclampsia
"The causes of Pregnancy Induced Hypertension are still under study. A genetic cause has been suggested as well as raised activity of the blood lipid system, which is however determined genetically. One element of the lipid system is lipoprotein a, which may have a key role in prediction of preeclampsia. The aim of our study was to determine lipoprotein (a) concentration in women with preeclampsia and in healthy pregnancies, and to assess the usefulness of lipoprotein (a) concentration as prognostic factor of eclampsia. Sera from 19 women with preeclampsia and from 19 with healthy pregnancies were tested. Our results show that determination of lipoprotein (a) levels in preeclampsia may be significant as predictive factor of eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Pre-eclampsia, a life-threatening disease unique to pregnancy, has been called a disease of theories. To date, there has been no widely accepted predictive test or therapeutic intervention to prevent or delay pre-eclampsia. The discovery of a new placental hormone, neurokinin B, may finally help to answer some of the past mysteries.",preeclampsia
"This is a descriptive, exploratory study which aimed at identifying the factors that are associated with pre-eclampsia in teenagers. The study also aimed at assessing the quality of midwifery care during labour in teenagers with pre-eclampsia so that recommendations can be made based on empirical findings. The study was done within Health Region H of KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa. A structured interview schedule was designed to tap information from pre-eclamptic teenagers in an attempt to identify factors associated with pre-eclampsia. A checklist was also designed and administered to assess the care of a pre-eclamptic teenager during labour. The study revealed that factors like age, nulliparity and socio-economic status were associated with pre-eclampsia. In as far as the rest of the factors, there was no relationship as indicated in previous studies. The study also revealed that teenagers affected by pre-eclampsia delayed in attending the antenatal clinic resulting in the control of the disease being difficult. In as far as midwifery care, the study revealed that psychological and social care, as well as the hygienic state of patients was not satisfactory. Based on the findings of the study, it is recommended that health education on prevention of pre-eclampsia should be done on an ongoing process, while carers for teenage mothers should be given inservice education programmes on psychosocial care. The physical environment for maternity units must be improved.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia has a familial component suggesting that one or more common alleles may act as susceptibility genes. Some families may have ""private"" predisposing mutations. The central role of the placenta in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia implies that fetal genes contribute to the disease process. Twin studies support the role of maternal and fetal gene interaction. Candidate gene studies have not yielded consistent results. Genome-wide linkage studies provide powerful means to study disease susceptibility genes, and several loci have been mapped. Parent-of-origin effect of the STOX1 gene has been suggested on chromosome 10q22 locus in the Dutch population. Maternally inherited missense mutations in the STOX1 gene of the fetus have been shown to co-segregate with the maternal preeclamptic phenotype. Up-regulation of placental leptin expression has been found in several studies and might be of importance in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. DNA microarray is ideal tool for screening gene expression in preeclamptic tissues, but critical attitude is needed when interpreting the results. The placental DNA and mRNA in maternal plasma hold great promise as novel biomarkers for the prediction of preeclampsia. Finding genes prediposing to preeclampsia will enhance our understanding of the disease mechanism, and might allow identification of prognostic and therapeutic subgroups.",preeclampsia
"From Antenatal Diagnostic Center referrals over 22 months, consultations for early-onset fetal growth restriction versus skeletal dysplasia were retrospectively identified. Those with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) levels are the focus of this report. All had an early ultrasound confirming menstrual dates and subsequent sonography at < 28 weeks with at least two fetal biometric measures delayed by > or = 2 standard deviations from mean values. Of the five patients identified, the mean gestational age at the time of diagnosis of fetal growth restriction was 23.3 +/- 2.9 weeks. All had normal karyotypes and normal amniotic fluid AFP. None of the patients had evidence of hypertension or pre-eclampsia at diagnosis of fetal growth restriction. All five gravidas subsequently developed severe pre-eclampsia from 5.5 to 12.5 weeks after documentation of fetal growth delay. Three developed HELLP syndrome. Pregnancies were continued a mean duration of 10-2 weeks, with all five delivering at preterm gestations (mean = 33.5 +/- 1.7 weeks) for maternal indications of severe pre-eclampsia. Unexplained early-onset fetal growth restriction in conjunction with unexplained elevations of MSAFP together consistently heralded the subsequent development of severe pre-eclampsia.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To describe the duration of expectant management and the indications for termination of expectant management of pregnancies complicated by severe pre-eclampsia remote from term. Study design: We identified pregnancies complicated by severe pre-eclampsia diagnosed between 24 weeks and 31 weeks 6 days at our institution in 1991-98. Pertinent clinical data were obtained from review of maternal and neonatal charts. Comparison of patients was based on the duration of time from admission to delivery: < 48 h (group 1), 48 h to 7 days (group 2), and > or = 7 days (group 3). Results: A total of 142 women met all study criteria. Seventy-nine (55.6%) women were delivered within 48 h, 42 (29.6%) between 48 h and 7 days, and 21 (14.8%) at > or = 7 days from diagnosis. Of group 1 patients (< 48 h), 59 (74.7%) were delivered for maternal indications while 20 (25.3%) were delivered for fetal indications. Of group 2 patients (48 h to 7 days), 35 (83.3%) were delivered for maternal indications while seven (16.7%) were delivered for fetal indications. Of group 3 patients (> or = 7 days), 16 (76.2%) were delivered for maternal indications while five (23.8%) were delivered for fetal indications. There were no significant differences in the indications for delivery based on the duration from admission to delivery. Conclusions: Despite an aggressive approach towards expectant management of preterm pregnancies complicated by severe pre-eclampsia, most patients were delivered within 48 h for maternal indications.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To examine the effect of a combination of screening and treatment with low-dose aspirin on the prevalence of early-onset pre-eclampsia (PE). Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of two consecutive cohorts of women screened for early PE. The first cohort was observed to determine whether algorithms developed to screen for PE at 11 to 13 + 6 weeks' gestation could be applied to our population. High-risk women in the second cohort were advised on their risk and offered aspirin (150 mg at night), with treatment starting immediately after screening. The prevalence of early PE and the proportion of women with PE delivering at 34-37 weeks' gestation were compared between the cohorts. Results: In the observational and interventional cohorts, 3066 and 2717 women, respectively, were screened. There were 12 (0.4%) cases of early PE in the observational cohort and one (0.04%) in the interventional cohort (P < 0.01). Among all women with PE delivering before 37 weeks, 25 (0.83%) were in the observational cohort and 10 (0.37%) in the interventional cohort (P = 0.03). Conclusions: A strategy of first-trimester screening for early PE coupled with prescription of aspirin to the high-risk group appears to be effective in reducing the prevalence of early PE.",preeclampsia
"Objective: To assess obstetric outcomes in women in their second pregnancy after preeclampsia in the first pregnancy. Methods: We utilized population-based birth registry data of Kuopio University Hospital to investigate pregnancy outcome measures in 123 nonpreeclamptic parous women with prior preeclampsia and 21 women with repeat preeclampsia in their second pregnancy. The general obstetric population was used as a reference group in logistic regression. Results: The development of recurrent preeclampsia in 15% of women is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. A first preeclamptic pregnancy may offer protection against disease recurrence and a history of preeclampsia has no significant effects on birth weight, fetal distress, or prematurity rate. However, they have a higher rate of pregnancy-induced hypertension and abdominal deliveries, and, therefore, a greater proportion of newborns are referred to neonatal units for observation. Conclusions: Women in whom preeclampsia does not recur have good obstetric outcomes in their second delivery, almost comparable to that in the general obstetric population. A genetic susceptibility to preeclampsia alone has minor effects on pregnancy outcome in a second pregnancy if the disease does not recur.",preeclampsia
"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-associated illness affecting multiple organ systems. Symptoms typically occur after the 20th week of gestation and consist of hypertension (>140/90 mmHg) and proteinuria (>300 mg/day). It is one of the leading causes of premature birth worldwide and early diagnosis and treatment are essential for both fetal and maternal health. Therapy is aimed at lowering blood pressure sufficiently to prevent the most severe complications such as intracranial hemorrhages. At the same time attention must be paid to the possible untoward effects of blood pressure medications on uteroplacental perfusion and fetal well being. Magnesium is the cornerstone for both prevention and control of eclamptic cerebrovascular events. In cases of severe preeclampsia and eclampsia prompt delivery is indicated, often carried out by Cesarean section (>34 weeks of gestation). Compared to general anesthesia, regional anesthesia techniques offer certain advantages to both mother and fetus and in the absence of contraindications are the methods of choice.",preeclampsia
"Eighty-eight normotensive gravid women between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation underwent urine evaluation for the presence of microalbuminuria and urinary calcium excretion (calcium/creatinine ratio). Preeclampsia subsequently developed in 83% of patients with a high level of microalbuminuria (greater than or equal to 11 micrograms/ml) and a low calcium/creatinine ratio (less than or equal to 0.04). Conversely, 94% of women who did not demonstrate high microalbuminuria and a low calcium/creatinine ratio remained normotensive at the time of delivery. These results suggest that changes in renal function are present in gravid women who are otherwise free of symptoms in whom preeclampsia will eventually develop. Testing for microalbuminuria and a calcium/creatinine ratio may be a useful screening tool in predicting the subsequent development of preeclampsia.",preeclampsia
